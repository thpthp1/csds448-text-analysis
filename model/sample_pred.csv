4,95035,"I'm enjoying the game, but I have a few suggestions. A way to skip the tutorial would be nice. It logged me out of my account and made me go through the tutorial before letting me access the menu to login. And a √ó4 speed option would be cool if possible but not needed",4,False

4,129541,"Super fun game, and a bit addicting. I like that I've been able to progress without spending on any in-app purchases. (I might have if they weren't so expensive) however if you pace yourself and be patient. Understand your not gonna build your dream team in under a month.. I'm almost finished with my 3rd month, and you have plenty of opportunities to get shards and level up, as long as you play smart, do the challenges and so forth. (get 3* gauntlet with attack % as main stat) hate those",4,True
4,4646,"Update: my problem was fixed so now I'll write a review, all memes besides its a fun game but really time consuming. The quick battle option isnt quick at all. It just presses the replay button for you. So the main thing I wish could change is actually getting things sped up. Like a 4x battle or quick battle actually taking a few seconds. And maybe instead of having just 30 each day its 30 for campaign, 60 for dungeons so I can actuallt burn off my 3k energy that I have :')",4,True

4,94484,Only reason for not 5 stars is the pop up ads about deals everytime you play . It's so annoying I dont need reminding every day what's on offer . If I wish to by something I will go to the shop. Other then that great game . Keep it up guys,4,True
4,141453,"Enjoy the game a lot, would be nice to have the option to run campaigns and dungeon levels multiple times on auto instead of only being able to run a level once at a time. even if there was an option between cycling through a level once or three times after completing the levels manually.",4,True

Little buggy, thought it would be a bit more narrative driven-- but oh well. For the first time I feel like the microtransactions aren't being forced... game play wise; the adverts for sales are pretty ""in-your-face-y""; but the game is balanced enough not to force MT's, and imo is more deserving of the monetization",4,True

It's true that Plarium might give you rares but amidst those rares are unpolished gems. And that is what RSL teaches us. To hone those unpolished gems. It's true that legendaries are so much rewarding. But seeing a rare or an epic champion winning your battles, then you know you're hardwork paid off. Kudos Plarium. üëçüèªüëçüèª",4,False

4,28449,I truly enjoy playing this game and don't mind spending for a better experience. I cant give it a 5 star rating because Plarium doesn't really listen to its players. They could improve this game in many ways but choose to only add on to existing formats. The rewards for tournaments are a joke and not even worth competing for.

4,14674,"I'm enjoying. I like the various characters and artifacts. Only thing I don't like was that, as a beginner, I got caught up in new characters and artifacts.

4,55183,Its a realy good game,4,False
4,45348,Amazing game. The reason I'm giving it 4 star instead of 5 is the turned based combat. If you make at least a game mode with live combat I'll give it a 5 star. Worth the time.,4,True

4,38662,"This is a good game, it saves progress for me at least and all I do is skip its storyline. The Lil spiders in the spiders den from the spider Ling thing from the spider boss's animation is crooked.

4,93273,Great game! Lots of fun but that auto could be more logical. It burns everything at once and then you have to wait for the cool down. The gathering of resources is good.

4,57807,"Very rarely rate anything or play them for a long period of time, but Raid has got me hooked with a lot of user friendly features. Sure, the grind is insane, but they make it reasonably manageable and provide plenty of ways to grab stuff for free. Just don't expect to compete at high lvl pvp without paying a ton. Also, the pop ups are some of the most aggressive I have ever seen in any game (5+ upon opening) but the gameplay and RPG building is strong enough to make me forgive it.",4,True

4,76402,Pretty easy to get sucked in. Good graphics. Up the FPS limit to 60 and it's super smooth. Only gripes I have with the game are whenever I try to open up the support section in my options it doesn't load and my app will stuck loading on the authentication section. Usually I have to restart my phone and it works after that. There's a battle pass and lots of pay-to-win-esque features but what game doesn't have those now so I guess it's fine.

4,3660,You have to get shards to actually summon? Oof. Edit: my problem isn't that you cant get them per say its just that you need money and the shard to summon. The rate at which I get free shards means if I didn't ration the summons I couldn't finish the dailies some times. You should give out more of the lowest tier shards if you actually care.,4,False
