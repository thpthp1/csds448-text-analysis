"I love this game, graphics 10/10, gameplay is fun and easy to strat, but having to sign up to a Nintendo account just to keep your process is kinda pointless to do. I said I signed up later, forgot and now all my data is gone. I recommend to the creators, to have it already saved to my account. this happened to me was because too much storage and when I organized it i wanted to reinstall it",4
"This game used to very fun and generous to players and I was more than happy to spend money. However, recently the game has implemented some very underhanded tactics to force people to spend. I do NOT recommend starting this game now. The best times for this game are long gone due to the developer's greed.",2
"dont recommend. the game literally runs off of too much. for one: impossible boss fights. for two: impossible to get good people unless you spend actual money on the game. for three: weapons arent strong, and basiclaly rip offs.",1
I think I would have liked playing...but it made my tablet extremely HOT! Had to uninstall!,4
"It's an amazing game, I just couldn't drop it when I started playing, the gacha system is incredible and the plot is great I also love the characters but the reason it is not getting five stars is because I honestly wish I could have been told a way to restore game data because I accidentally uninstalled the game and had to start all over again from the first chapter which sucks in my opinion, other than that the game is great",4
"Really really great game, the pull rates are nice, we get tickets for summoning every now and then, the story is pretty interesting too. But I only give it a 4 because unlocking the story is a bit tedious, you always have to level up the Halidom and level up the Smithy before you unlock the story, as well as your own island",4
Cute and awesome game,5
"Good game but curse of nihility kills all your old units so they can make more money by making you buy new units by simply changing ""buff"" to ""amp"" and making new bosses have full resistance to old status ailments like ""poison"" but weak to new units status ailments like ""stormlash"". Basically say goodbye to your collection if you plan on taking the latest endgame content and hope you get lucky or spent enough money for all the gala units with amp and new ailment inflictions.",3
Amazing,5
"A truly fun mobile Action RPG. Since it's release, the game took many positive turns, adding content regularly, with enough story and challenge to entertain for months. Nintendo seems to have helped reign in the worst habits of these mobile games in terms of allowing progression without feeding money in endlessly. It is, however, still pay to win, and dropping tons of money allows you to gear up in the end game 10 times faster. It's great, but still must lose a star or two for being pay to win.",4
Doesn't seem bad but half of the buttons on any given screen aren't even there I had to guess where the start button was to start quest.,1
This game is pretty good.,4
"I don't like spending money mobiles, but this is worth spending money on once and awhile. This game is very F2P friendly, the team gives out alot of stuff either for an event or collab. 9 days of free tenfold summon is amazing for someone like who doesn't like to spend money on these kinds of games. The games story is bland in the beginning but it gets better as it goes one, the gameplay is fun and addictive. This game is seriously underrated compared to other mobile games.",5
Love playing it n the story is so interesting,5
I like thank switch to different with different personally and dragon and the stories,5
Great gacha game Progress just requires being active Fun and gets updates Entertaining story Does as advertized in the app store,5
This game has a lot to do and is a lot of fun!,5
"After fixing up some things, the game runs really well! Gameplay is really fun and easy!",5
This was my favorite game back then and it's still good,5
"Awesome gameplay with tons of content, fun and even engaging writing, and (most importantly) it's generous with its gacha currency both in game, and from the developers. Edit: two years later and this is still true. The main story's gotten kind of stupid, but the side and character stories are still good. Tons of QoL updates, too.",5
Another great gacha game! I love running my character in the missions and the fact that this game has co-op is just superb.,5
"This game is incredible, especially when compared to others of its kind. I am writing this review in response to one of the other reviewers. If you crash while you are summoning, you still get everything from that summon. It will not play the animation again, but if you check your summoning history or inventory, what you recieved from summoning will be there. The game takes many measures to ensure a high quality, intuitive experience. If you are lagging/crashing, lower the graphics in settings.",5
Pretty fun and engaging for a Gatcha. Only 3 stars though because it is excrutiatingly Data Heavy. I'm talking gigs..and gigs.. and gigs... in dire need of serious optimization.,3
"The game itself is great, and the story is interesting. However, the minimum filesize to be able to play is roughly 3-4 gigabytes and it can't be transferred to the SD Card. The game so far CAN be beaten without paying, and the purchases aren't too intrusive, but the gacha system revolves around how much money you give it and the pity system is unusable without spending roughly 22,000 in ingame currency within a week or two, which is near impossible without paying.",3
"I absolutely adore dragalia it took me a long time to get into the game fully but as of now it is one of my favourites to play. The music is outstanding, the story is great and interesting and finally the game is actually challenging and that isn't common for Gatchas",5
"Dragalia Lost is my all-time favorite rpg app. It's well put together and super fun, with an array of characters and quests.",5
Finaly working fine,5
"The game is really fun. Really good for f2p players as the game gives premium currency like candy. I'm just discontent with the new layout and visuals, I prefered the old one. A small nitpick but the game is really great.",4
Greatly improved from what it once was.,3
"Having returned from a haiatus, I am now unable to link my account as the game will not open a browser to do so. I am now unable to play my account which I spent actual money and a huge time investment on. Play other games which will not flush your progress down the drain.",5
"Ive been playing this game since it was started, i spend like 30-50$ only and it is worth of pay and until now im still playing thr game.The game mechanics and the music are awesome! Gacha is also incredible, high rates of getting new characters, for 2 years of playing i can say this is one of the best gacha game i play",5
"Reeally fun game. Easy controls, great time eater. Best part, they give you so much for free and you really don't have to ""pay to play"" at all. Everything you can buy, is something you can earn. Albeit, there's always a grind but that comes with the territory. This game alone stands pretty tall. Wish Nintendo would port this game to a 'Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' format. It'd be amazing!",5
"Can't play without update. Update error ""Cant install Dragalia Lost.""",5
When I installed it it just put on the logos and then a white screen I wait and wait but nothing it just a white screen and I have plenty storage strange,1
Very enjoyable. The devs appear to listen to feedback and later chapters have improved the story telling.,5
"Update#2: Emile dragalia gives me life, Emile content gives me strength. Best mobile game please show Emile some love",5
So far so good.,5
"The ai needs major improvements to keep pace with endgame fights. A manual ""gather on me""/split up button would go a long way.",3
I enjoy this game but getting into end game is very hard where groups won't play with you if you don't have a certain set up. This causes less lobbies for you to play in as you climb higher into harder content. Controller support would be nice.,4
Its a good game overall but I want my progress back how do I get it? I already have a linked account but how do I load it?,4
"Great Game, mechanics I'd say is similar to something like FFXIV it doesn't get difficult until mid to late game. Most amazing of all is the good gacha system, generous 5star and almost no need for any duplicates. If you want a game that doesn't constantly ask you to pay then this is it. But I do recommend supporting developers like these reward them for not making us feel like we need to pay.",5
"One of the coolest, most original Gacha games. Easy to start off, and as you get towards endgame content it gets progressively harder. The AI still needs work, but overall a great time to play.",5
"yessir nintendo, y'all did y'all thing wid this 🥶",5
So updating my review. My last review talked about how the game was giving as much rewards for summoning like they used. Recently they've added mighty quests which gives an additional 25 wyrmite on top of the daily 50. This honestly feels like it makes up for shortening on the dailies for events. If this is a permanent thing than I think Dragalia is doing great. Glad I stuck with it so far.,4
very good very dragalia lost,5
Amazing storyline plus Iconic game crossovers plus simple game play equals An outstanding app. Thanks dragalia for all the great adventures.,5
Great game,5
Really great game. One of my favorite games that I play.,5
"A must have new free to play game from Nintendo and Cygames, amazing summons and events",5
"Pretty fun game, but the rates are bad",3
This is honestly the first phone he that's had me hooked by the story and there's a new battle royal mode that's actually really good and I'm not huge on battle royals,4
Love it picked it up at the persona event and can't let go of it surprisingly isnt milking for in game transactions they are there if you want them but you can progress without them fairly easily,5
I can't get pass thru the first loading screen. Won't let me tap anything at all.,2
Good so far,5
Alot of fun and the story is actually good,5
I love it kind of reminds me of someone I'm fused with lol :) permanently I didn't get enjoy this game when I first played the dark web or aj the devil in disguise would slow down this game from downloading I figured they didn't want me to fuse or aj the devil in disguise with God lol too bad it happened anyways,5
Games really fun and love the story. Only draw back is the gotcha rate is really bad. I've managed a few 5 star characters but after I only seem to get copies of the same.....feels really ridged..... Wow well since my reveiw above i managed to pull the same 5 star dragon 7 times......so whats that about...,2
"I've been playing this game since launch and I can honestly say that its so much fun that I don't see an end in sight for me and this game. Though just a heads up, it is a gacha game, which is probably why its so well made. So I would do your research into gachas and see if that's the sort of thing your fine with. If so, this is a fantastic mobile game with a compelling story, interesting characters, and engaging gameplay. I definitely recommend it.",5
It's really fun! I love the idea of the shape shifting and the fact that there's ACTUAL boss battles where you get get punished for poor play on a mobile game is... Refreshing.,5
Fun.time consuming.,4
Absolutely love this game. I've played this for a long time and It never gets old. The only reason I have 4 stars is because it is so hard to get eldwater and the summons are do expensive. Maybe add a quest that allows you to get a limited amount of eldwater. Would rate 5 stars if you do so.,4
Ok so I got a new phone and tried to transfer the data but the Nintendo account would not connect so I lost all of my progress that u works mouths on and spent 200+ dollars on so it sucked,1
Gacha hell right from the start. Couldn't even get a decent initial reroll and tried hundreds of times. Gave up after a while realizing I'll never play some of the best units. Wish there was a non-gacha version of the game.,1
just started so will have to see if it gets better,5
Beautiful graphics with easy game mechanics.,4
"One word, AMAZING",5
"With the 50 free summons that are repeatable, I'm already happy!",5
Absolutely AMAZING !!,5
"Love the game but I hope we can soon get an update where you can play the game with voices without it taking up to much space. That aside I wish we could eventually get more wyrmite from events, only 10 wyrmite per mission completion really isn't a lot when compared to the 100 wyrmite we used to get around launch. This isn't to say I don't appreciate the tickets we've been receiving but those really aren't the same as summoning in rows of ten consistently like you use to be able to",2
"I loved this game so much. If it becomes a standalone game I'd buy it. But it's gotten progressively worse and worse to the point where it just hurts to play. The progression is just all kinds of messed up, content feedback is all kinds of messed up, and I'm tired of hearing how great the developer thinks they're doing. It's just not worth playing anymore.",1
"2021 Update: Nothing major has changed, neither in balance or mechanics. The game is fun enough, but it likes to crash when you win end game boss fights, then mark it as a loss and forfeit your rewards. The summons also tend to give you duplicates, regardless of the stated odds, which I find very suspect considering summons are fairly expensive in this game. Also, the late game content is impossible (Literally) to clear without very rare Heroes and equipment that you can only get by summoning.",2
"Update after update, mana circles still don't work for me. Please fix.",4
I love this gacha style rpg,5
"This game has improved a lot since pre-release! I'm having a lot of fun, thank you for this game!!",5
I really wanted to thank the team for the free gifts💙 thank you Nintendo! And Cypher💙,5
It took so long to long,2
"Quite an interesting little romp so far. I just beat the first dragon. The world of Dragalia Lost is fairly interesting, and strategy and JRPG nuts looking for a phone beat 'em up could do a lot worse. So far I've avoided spending a cent. I honestly think it's a bit cramped on a phone but it might not be that much better on tablet. The greatest strength of the game is the anime art style. It completely nails the 3D modeling of the late DS era and also reminds me of the PS2 Tales games. Not bad.",4
"Unplayable, loads to white screen.",1
"Too many characters, game scales weirdly. After a short while of playing (a day or two?) you are unstoppable and then after a little while longer the game is so hard you can't win a single battle. There are so many characters and items and it's really hard to tell the characters apart or keep track of them. Developer, please work on balancing the game and get rid of 90% of the characters, items and different modes or at least make some of the features things you have to unlock, it's too much.",1
"decent game but progression feels a bit monotonous, a lot of the missions in the main story feel the same other than the story",4
At first I thought this was your average gacha but it's different they let you do 50 summons with unlimited retires after tutorial you get a good start this is truly a ftp gacha game it's a must try game,5
Really fun And arcade stye good,5
It's really going downhill :(,1
This game is good it has a great story great graphics and more but it always crashes on me when im playing i thought it was because i need more space because my phone is almost full but no its not that because i deleted pictures and apps that i dont need but it stil crashes when i playing. This game is not for F2P players and this game is a bit to greedy you have to pay $40 just for a 10 pull so if i wanted to pull 3 times it would be $120.Maybe intsall this game if you want to waste money,1
Pretty good game would recommend,3
Why no 60fps in menus?,1
"I honestly like this game a lot. The music is great and the gameplay is good. The only problem that I can't stand is that space you need to download the entire game. Another thing that I can't stand is that the game starts to lag during multi-player and at random times. To be honest, the controls are pretty weird. The rates are still low like in every cygames games and there is a new banner every week. The pity system never carries over and makes it impossible to pity a character you want.",4
The controls are not great I do not recommend this game.,2
This is a great game overall but the reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is for personal reasons. When switching over my accounts to different phone I've lost all of my weapons I've had sence the release of the game and I had lost motivation to grind it back if there's a way to fix it please let me know.,4
Can't get past the title screen. Phone is a Redmi Note 8,4
Curse of Nihility is slowly killing this game,1
They've implemented a new mechanic called Curse of Nihility that absolutely kills endgame content. It stops all of your characters from buffing themselves and eachother. Fights become prolonged and boring. It makes most adventurers and dragons useless and forces you to have certain characters from the gacha. Not to mention the newly added grind for Gala mana spirals that takes up to 23 days to finish. Horrible game design and people aren't happy. This might be the death of Dragalia Lost.,1
"Extremely player unfriendly changes recently with endgame being locked to such a small specific cast of 5 star characters. Pay up, get lucky or give up any hope of playing endgame.",2
This would've been good if I was actually able to tap the screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still can't even get past the 1st menu. I think this was because of an update. I will change this review if it ever gets fixed,5
It's been fun,4
best game 10 out of 10 game of the years I get to make a team of gun wielding heroes and adventurers and bust a cap in enemies asses,5
"I love this game so much! My sister got me into it and I can't stop playing! It's so much fun! I love it! Even though I haven't gotten far, it's quite a good game and very well designed. I love everything about it and the in game events are extremely fun and entertaining! Keep doing good things, Dragalia Lost Team!",5
"A decent game, if you like anime, RPG and gacha games, this is for you. I gave it a try and, I can't background download is my main problem, you will see a long download screen as soon as you beat the tutorial, then After making a few teams and beating the second level, I hit the skip campaign button and it forced me to re-download the data. It's a decent gacha game, however there are better options, Puni Puni/Wibble Wobble namely.",3
I Wonder if Zethia is in the game if not please add her please And I Know She is also a helper unit outside the party but please i beg of you please other then that its By Far My Favorite Game and i know that there is a Zena but i would like to see the real Zethia soon please And I Love The New Updates and This is By Far By Far My Favorite Game and I would Definitely Recommend This App✅ and I love all the new characters and updates,5
Pretty good so far,4
"Potentially one of the best Gacha games out there. Story, character design, mechanics, gameplay, online play. Sadly let down by the lowest drop rates I've ever seen and a pity system that switches far too quickly to be of any use. Literally trades out your built up pity points within a few days. Excellent game for whale fans, not for f2p or casual spenders. Typical Nintendo greed.",2
"I use to rate this game at 5 stars, but recently the game has gone a little downhill. The lack of summoning resources and the constant need to grind have lessened my enjoyment of this game. I still think it is worth a try, but be cautious.",3
This game is bad. It's not very fun. Most of the time it's just frustrating to play. The music is mostly garbage. The chat stickers are toxic. The players are toxic. Newcomers will find themselves shut out of a lot of content. The graphics are overly flashy and muddled. The story and characters are the only decent parts. Everything else is trash. Don't play this.,2
Gacha pull simulator with unbearable endgame and an insufferable Kingdom building mechanic that for some reason directly determines the stats of every single unit you have.,2
This is an excellent game has a great story and the game play so far has been excellent,5
System requirements are expensive Crisp design Save space by skipping voice pack,4
"The quality and generosity of the this game and its developers is quite surreal. Great, hands-on game play, great music, great characters, and even surprisingly great writing too. Dragalia Lost stands as a monument to the quality mobile games should aim for. That's not to say it doesn't have its own problems, of course it does, like how hard it is to get wyrmite on your own once you become a veteran, but it's all mostly nitpicks.",5
"With back-to-back events, rotating summon events, and long story segments, I always burn out of Dragalia Lost after a few months. The sad thing is being force-fed events distracts and burns out players when there's more than enough content in the game otherwise.",3
fun with nice splash art,5
TOTES uhmazingg. VERY* fair Gacha game that requires skill. (SOMETIMES UNFORGIVING RNG lol) MAKE SURE TO DO DAILIES :) events also help a lot! They are very generous with drops! :D Also love the story and characters <3,5
Good game that turned into a money grab with 2.0 release,1
"While tackling the higher difficulty is still quite impossible for me since I'm a more casual player, the collecting part of it has been quite enjoyable. If only the Halidom can be expanded further and there is more activities we can do withing the Halidom, that would be great.",5
It's not working on the OnePlus 9 Pro,1
"It's a really good game with good graphics and good combat and all, but there's a summoning system that allows you to get 10 sigils per multi, and they run out by a certain time. Getting 300 sigils lets you buy one of those good units that they game tells you is really rare, and i mean REALLY rare. I was at 290 when they reset a day earlier. I was gonna buy a unit named ""Gala Mym"", but apparently they switched the banners a day earlier. They switched the banner at 4/2 . It was supposed to be 4/3",2
"I was downloading the required data, then it had a network connection and didn't save any of the downloading process, which took an hour..",2
Good gacha game. Easiest re roll you can ever get with 50 free summons. Takes 5 seconds to re roll it. Controls feel smooth and responsive and there is an enormous cast of characters to pick from. I am still early in the game so I can not give an end game review but from what I have seen on you tube and reviews it seems good.,5
Really good!!,5
Started on launch and ended up uninstalling about 2 months later during the first run of the Wish to the Winds event. The game just wasn't as fleshed out as I wanted at the time. I came back 10 days prior to the 1st Anniversary event and fell back in love with the game. Sure it's a gacha game but CyGames is so generous with giving out free summons it genuinely doesn't feel like it sometimes. If you're looking for a new gacha or a fun time waster you can sink HOURS into I'd 100% recom,5
I cant get past the tap to start screen :(,1
Enjoying the game so far,5
"Great game, original and great characters.",4
Yeah,3
This game is pretty good with all around good mechanics,5
Great.,5
👌,5
Awesome game. Love the update. Love being able to auto battle in Raids now. Was working if we could repeat auto battle in Raids as well soon?,5
I love Dragalia lost.,5
I'm having so much fun playing this game,5
"I love this app so much, I just wish it had a smaller file size so I could play it. I'm sure it's well over 6gb now and it's a lot. I cant even download it onto my phone and its upsetting because it's such a good game",3
I love this game as much as I love dragons!!,5
"Overall the game is nothing less then excellent, but there's a problem. I'm missing a lot of characters, weapons, and dragons. It would be very nice if you could give them back to me. I'll be sure to raise my star rating if you do. (Thank you)",4
"Less buggy now, but whenever I go to chapter selection all text dissapears and the next time I finish a quest it freezes the game.",1
Pretty great for an ios game. If this was on the ps2 or gamecube I would not be unhappy.,5
"Good and fun game! But the sadest thing is that it more likely should be a switch game since i can't participate in these events and keep the game on me since it requires TOO MUCH SPACE in my phone. HELP, it also burns the battery like crazy, and these events make me upset since im all ""how can i do this if i can't actually install the game and play it..?"" Its one of my biggest problems with it other than being gacha towards the game's main cast.",3
still 5 stars from me but I've played since the beginning but I think there's a lot of new stuff for new players too lazy to write a proper review but I still love the game,5
"A new review since I can't find the old one, amazing game and I've enjoyed it since launch, crashing issues experienced as of this Update are most likely due to the need to update Google Chrome or Android System Webview. Thanks google!",5
"Honestly, this game doesnt have enough to keep you invested.",1
Good game but suddenly greedy with summoning currency. Would not recommend to new players.,4
It lags a lot and always has trouble updating,4
A game I keep coming back to,5
"There is a serious lacking of confirmation prompts when spending the premium in-game currency (diamantium) on a ten-fold summon. They will ask you if you are sure that you want to spend a FREE voucher, but doesn't ask you if you are sure if you want to spend diamantium ($$) . I bought some diamantium and decided I wanted to save it. Well my finger slipped and boom there goes the diamantium on something I didn't want to spend it on. I wrote to their support team, got a very generic response",3
My rng poo poo.,5
It's a fun hero collecting game with lots to upgrade and plenty of story. It's F2P friendly and the 3d action gameplay is solid and even challenging in the higher level content.,5
Fun andultible things to do to stay busy.,5
"Fun and stunning looking original IP Nintendo mobile game, relativity F2P friendly. The only reason it's a 4* it's due to its massive data required to maintain within your device. There is a lite option but I feel you don't get the full experience in lite mode.",4
woo lad oh boy yeah uh huh lmao,5
Needs a Switch port. We already got Angry Birds. Hungry Sharks. We even have FFXV pocket edition just to name a few But yea this game on Switch please! Its already a nintendo game see already haf way there lol love this game great work developers and to keep Dragalia Lost active for many years to come. loved Caged Desiers my favorite part thus far,5
"Love the music, gameplay and character design.",5
Love the story and characters and the events are very fun. Easy 5☆ review but sadly dropping to a 3☆ because ever since its 2nd anniversary summoning resources have been cut in half and its beginning to hurt both veteran and beginner players. Especially with seasonal events and collabs happening more often than before. Making me feel like a pay to win kind of game now and its not cheap either with 1 ingame pack costing $40 per pack. Hopefully this changes back soon.,3
"Absolute quality mobile game, A* work from Cygames as usual",5
The most F2P friendly gacha you'll ever play. There's so much to do with monthly events & awesome collaborations. Also 4* & 3* unit can be as effective as SSR with the right investment & built so no need to spend real money. And one thing that sets Dragalia apart from most gacha. Is the dev team actually listens to the community & make the necessary changes & improvements.,5
"Previous issue has been fixed! Thank you, o kind developers!",5
THANK,5
"A really great game, but the skill/shared skill features are too complicated. But other than that, I have no complaints 👍",4
Pretty good gp wise,5
"Liked the game til I lost 2 accounts, I stopped playing for a year due to phone issues only to return to a new game even tho I logged in with my Nintendo account that I linked to it.",1
The game is epic love the bgm and he character is kawaii lol,5
good,5
It is a really good game I like all the cut scenes,4
"This game is honestly a good game. But I've had to strip down so much of the content just to make and make the game run smoother, but it still crashes all the time and the game feels like it's being stretched thin. Even more disturbing is the restrain being put on the F2P resources for summoning, with progressively less coming out as the months go by. I still haven't caught up with the more advanced players because the meta keeps changing and the game keeps crashing.",1
Far too complicated.,1
Nintendo game,5
"Good rates, but too convoluted on upgrading. You have to get equips, characters, dragons and cards, then you have like 5 ways of making each thing I mentioned above stronger. You cant even remember it all",3
"Waifus and dragons? Uhmm, yes pls",5
"It's just a really fun game to play. Summon rates are good, the rewards are high, and the plot is great. I never thought a mobile game would exceed my expections so much. Graphics and style are smooth, and the little animations and attention to detail never fail to amaze me. Personally really love the story and characters, they're all quite compelling- especially in later chapters. It has some interesting themes and character motivations befitting of a great shounen anime. Thanks, devs",5
The voice acting and vocal tracks in the background are a very nice touch that make the game feel more lively.,5
Fantastic game so far. Love the frequency of events. Note: 4 GBs of ram minimum if you don't want to deal with crashes.,5
Really good game so far 👏,5
I really like the game of how you can control your characters and do whatever you want,5
Loving this so far!,5
"Great game, abysmal gacha. I spent 9000+ gems on ilia banner and guess what? None of them hit the jackpot. As far as the gameplay is good, I think the gacha system needed more improvement, something like a guaranteed system. Else we would spent hundreds of dollars and still risk getting nothing out of it.",3
masterpiece lol,5
"With exception to summoning, this game is perfect. Graphics/Gameplay/Story/ Replayability all 5 stars. Great for all ages. Summoning however is punishment for veteran players as many summoning showcases must be skipped in order to save for a guaranteed summon at an absurdly high cost.",5
Lags & Nintendo made it so you can't play on the computer anymore. Unless you have a $1000 phone look for another game. Also nintendo is getting greedier & it shows in this game. Nintendo lost a life long customer.,1
"Recently got into gacha games after playing Genshin Impact, and this game is wonderful. Graphics, story, combat, all good :)",5
Super generous free-to-play experience. Never felt the need to spend anything to have a great time with the game!,5
"Pretty fun game, very cute graphics, a nice gacha system.",4
"Its a grate game 10/10, love it, one question tho, when is the switch port",5
"if you like action-rpg gacha games, this is your game, seriously, it's really good, even if the gacha rates are sometimes unforgiving, but i'll bet you'll stay for the gameplay once you've played it, like me p.s. the stamina and wings you need to play this game regenerates really slowly, but those things won't be a problem when you have items that can refill them (which they give for free). totes a game u can play wherever, whenever",5
"Unfortunately the game is on a downward slope. Events are boring. Endgame content is so hyper-focused on increasing difficulties of boss battles with ever inflating HP values and very minor tweaks to enemy movesets. Changes to the gear system since weapons 2.0 have created an incredibly frustrating experience. Quality of Life changes maybe occur once a year, and don't apply evenly across all parts of the game. Half chapters of zero progression story content. Content released with zero testing.",1
"I've been playing this game since original release day, about 4 months ago, and love it. Only game like this that I played daily for that long. Haven't hit any paywall yet, the devs are awesome and communicate well about bugs and future plans, and give out a healthy amount of celebratory rewards you can use to summon characters and dragons! Update... Still playing!!!! Over 2 years later, that's unprecedented for me :)",5
Since they added a guarantee system at the steep 300 summons mark the rates have gotten so much worse. I haven't gotten a single banner unit in the last 30 multis. The game is great but they've gotten greedy. Don't support this cash grab anymore.,1
Okada is truly awful,1
One of the best mobile games out there. There's lots to do and all is very fun.,5
"Great mechanics but the drop rates are so damn low, please NEVER SPEND REAL MONEY",3
"By far, Dragalia Lost has some of the most developed & Nuanced characters i've seen in a mobile game. The rates are super generous compared to others, and the gameplay can be really fun but I do suggest getting into it for the characters / story rather than the gameplay specifically. Like, one thing about the story you probably wouldn't guess is the setting is post apocalyptic. That being said, the gameplay can be real fun if you're into it.",5
"As the game advances, the community is becoming more hostile to caring disabled players.",1
So far it's a lot of fun,4
Love it need more dragon forms pls,5
Really good game (and really generous),5
"Okay, first of all, anime, great music, action. I love it, the music is amazing and the graphics at max do NOT disappoint. It's all amazing! I love it!",5
"Doesn't work. After the Nintendo splash screen, the screen turns white and that's it.",1
Sign-in working as of 3/5/2021!!! Glad the devs sorted out the login issues. It's a fun game with great music.,5
Like super MarioRuncan you get rewards,5
"I got in contact with support about the issue with creating/linking a nintendo account for Android users, and it's now fixed via an update. Thanks for fixing the issue, Support Team!",5
"I have an account I am unable to link. I am using a new device Samsung Galaxy tab s7 plus. When I tap to link at loading screen, nothing happens. 2 days later the support team emailed me telling they have an update that will fix it and it worked! Now I can link my account. The people at Nintendo Co. Are above beyond the best than the others.",5
"Apologies for my last review, I was feeling immature at the time. The game is very good, but I'd like to mention that the auto-dracoshift function doesn't work with the Dragondrive system employed by a few characters.",5
Account linking issue fixed with latest update. Thank you!,5
"I got a new phone, tried to link my account and nothing. I touch the part that says link account, the load icon appears, but it never takes me to a login screen. Already uninstalled and reinstalled and every time it's just a new game. A years worth of progress down the drain.",1
"So far so fun, seems relatively f2p friendly though that seems to have led to the paid content costing more than you might expect",5
Great music,5
"When this game was released, I considered it to be the best gacha game I've ever played. I still think that's true, however as of the second anniversary, they've drastically lowered the amount of free summons you can do and have generally gotten far greedier in ways I don't approve of. I love this game a lot but until they fix this, I'm lowering my score from 5 stars to 3.",3
"One thing Nintendo is respected for: They don't lie! Every game they have ever advertised, every game they produced and every game that has ever been made by them has advertised the very same gameplay that the players will enjoy! They showed this game to be an overhead beat em up, and what do we get? An overhead beat em up! Nintendo is the best gaming company out there, better than Konami and Capcom in my opinion.",5
I can't see my character models,5
This game is just sooooòooooo fun like I can't even explain this game does not need any upgrades and the graphics is soon muah I am not far ahead in the story but I can tell it is gonna be FANTASTIC,5
"Can't log in with Nintendo Account, button does nothing, browser doesn't open. In a One Plus 8. I was able to play last year.",1
Still actively playing from launch to now. Best story and characters in any mobile rpg I've played. The gacha isn't predatory and resources in game are easy to earn. 11/10 across the board. Only mobile game I'd recommend to others.,5
"I want to love this game, and there is so much to love about it. The characters, the art style, the storyline. It's fantastic, especially for a mobile game. But the co-op is beyond frustrating. If you can't find a group online you can't advance the story, which is the situation I'm in. There's no local players for me to access and apparently no one to play with anywhere. There should be ""bots"" for people like me to work as filler so I can continue to play. If this issue persists, uninstall.",3
Fun but I put a different account and now. I have to restart for good 👍,5
It's good and it's got potential I hope this game keeps on getting new content and gets better I will keep playing it.,5
"Hey dragalia lost team, the link account button is broken right now. Please fix this",1
"Had to reinstall the game because I changed my Nintendo account password and it wouldn't let me into the app. After reinstall it won't link, the button just hangs. According to other reviews I'm not alone.",4
It a great app game,5
Cannot link to Nintendo switch account,2
Can't seem to log back into my account I click link account and it's still not poping up the site,3
"Unable to link Nintendo account. Whenever I click the button to do so, it just sits on the game screen and does not redirect to the Nintendo website like it should. This is preventing me from getting my saved data and purchases from my previous device. Using a OnePlus 8T+.",1
GALA PREASE,5
"Art and OST hooked me in. They put a lot of effort into the writing and really care about the community by giving us QoL changes, listening to feedback, and giving us free stuff from time to time. Entirely possible f2p if you have self restraint and patience lol. But I dropped off a year later because of character bloat and not having event chapters scale with your level (you have to slog through low level chapters before you can raid) and not being able to hide characters or dismiss them.",4
I love the play style of this game.,5
"Great fun, but Algerian Battle Royale mode is very laggy. You can attack someone and nothing seems to happen to them as they just continue to run off with no damage points displayed.",4
SO YOU GET RID OF ALL MY WEAPONS AND TURN THEM INTO SKINS THAT ARE USELESS ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?,1
"Why won't the game start when I hit the screen that says ""Tap To Start"". Please fix this. It won't even let me tap the ""Feedback"" or ""Help"" buttons, either.",1
Excellent game,5
My husband tried to get me to play this game for a while and I avoided it because of the gatcha aspect. I finally decided to give it a try and now have been playing it non stop since the 6 month anniversary. Dev's seem to truly care about player base and are very generous. Story can be a little cheesy but character design is very nice and I enjoy the amount of content available.,4
Honestly the best gacha out there for the money. Amazing gameplay that feels like a fleshed-out RPG rather than a shameless cash grab. Incredibly generous and endlessly charming- and that's not even touching on the collabs and content we have. Seriously. It's worth it.,5
This is probably the best f2p game out there. I found it a bit repetitive and without a proper guild system with some form of competition,5
It won't let me link my account.,1
"Good game but not as ""free to play"" friendly as it used to be.",4
Fun,5
"Legitimately great, fun game with reasonable gatcha rates. I've been playing this for months now and have felt no pressure to pay extra for elite units, just saving up my earned currency to buy them instead. Edit: it's now 2021 and I'm still playing. My previous review was posted upon the games release in 2018.",5
Good,5
"Nintendo's second best app, next to FEH",5
I cant link my account anymore after the update need help,3
"Very generous to their players, in comparison to Fire Emblem Heroes.",5
Can't log in to Nintendo account on new phone. The button does nothing. Everything I spent supporting the game down the drain.,1
This is an amazing and beautiful game. I really love it.,5
"Gameplay is great and brings a sort of mmo feel battling mechanically involved bosses with other players in coop gameplay. Summon rates kind of suck for getting rate up compared to the much higher spook rate. 300 summon spark system alleviates this somewhat at least, but the amount of free summons earned through gameplay has been greatly reduced since adding this mechanic.",2
"I enjoy this game, but one bug I have ran into has ruined that. The bug is preventing the app from redirecting you to google chrome when trying to link your account, and I have tried everything under the sun to try and fix this and nothing works. I don't know what to do, and I'm probably screwed because I'm either unlucky or the 3 year pixel update policy has screwed me here. Please fix this Edit: tried it on fire emblem heroes and words just fine, so it's probably more bug than software issue.",2
"While I wish the game still gave out as many free summons and wyrmite as before, the changes to the game have made it a much more enjoyable experience. I'm glad I don't have to rely on coop for end game content.",5
"fantastic game, dev's are INCREDIBLY generous, this is not a money sink. You can never pay a dollar and be par with anyone in this game. VERY f2p friendly. *edit, still true!*",4
Good game,5
love it. (09/24/20) I still love it. (02/25/21) I StILL LOVE ThIS GAmE!!!,5
i consider it epic.,5
"Neat game with some cool mechanics. Pretty generous with rewards and many collaborations(I hope they rerun them FE at least, haha). Doesn't take much to get through the game, can do most things with welfare characters. Huge roster, almost every character is viable. End game is tedious at times and is geared towards co-op which is cool but also adds to the grind waiting and whatnot. Good game overall though, but save up for Gala/anniversary banners.",4
"Ditto on a lot of others' comments. They keep watering prizes down for free players and game is starting to feel like they aren't trying. For example, instead of a new map mode for their recent collab with Persona 5s, (which shouldve been a huge thing), they just did a normal raid event. For day1ers, this is so disappointing. U at least tried with FE and MH.",2
love this game it's cute and really relaxing,5
"Obviously, right from the start this game is good. Really good fps, really high quality, and, really attracting story and gameplay. Don't see anything wrong with this game. I give it a nice five stars.",5
"Is a great game but when I play on battle royals the game lag and the screen go black pls can you fix it, I will be grateful",4
It is fun to play and the events are awsome i hope they add another event like persona,5
"best game ever, great game to play in between genshin",5
A fun game thats more than just another waifu collector.,5
EVERYBODY PLAY DRAGALIA LOST,5
The gacha is pretty fair I haven't spent any money in the game and have a good amount of 5⭐ adventurers,5
Amazing action rpg game. The combat is simple yet satisfying and the characters and their lore are great to read and watch.,5
"I really like the game play, the story, and the art. I just didn't like the way the model of characters looked, and pretty much stopped playing. Nothing wrong with it per se, but not my cup of tea. I loved the 2d art but the 3d, not so much.",3
"Theres a lot going on when you first boot up the game, but the tutorials are very detailed. I'm enjoying my first few hours on this game.",4
Dragon transformation fetish simulator.,5
"Another win for Nintendo. I like the difficulty of this game, but I also enjoy the ability to play casually and still make decent progress. Unfortunately, specific content often requires specific units, and finding players that will accept non-meta units in their party are far and few. Regardless this game is very, VERY generous with in-game rewards to increase your chance of getting must-have units. Even if you have the worst of luck there are Discord communities out there willing and able to help you progress.",5
Dragalia lost I ask a question I have played this game for a year but I can't connect to Nintendo and I can't change my account because the problem said there is no connection to my country i am from Indonesia can you give me a explanation and I already made my account,3
Goated game keep up the good work,5
Only reason I stopped playing was my phone was too old. But I'd gladly play it again when I upgrade.,5
"Top tier gacha goodness. With a nintendo pedigree behind it, this title delivers as a solid little action rpg to play regardless of how much time or money you have. As a purely f2p player I have experienced a wealth of pulls that has left my team fully stocked with interesting characters to play around with and that's all I could ever ask for. The action gameplay is simple but remains fun with team mechanics, transformations and multiplayer to spice things up. Large file size, but worth it!",5
"Updated review Feb. 2021 - The game is becoming gradually more disappointing. For the first year, they spoil you with rewards, and it feels like the rewards for your effort are worth it. They have retracted a lot of the rewards in addition to adding a lot more content, which waters down the rewards even more. The content is fine, but it's a struggle to get summons for more characters, even if you spend money. They've thrown their players under the bus for more cash.",3
"I say its a pretty cool game, love the crossovers, i just wish it wasnt so BIG ah well guess i better get a bigger memory card or different phone entirely? But still an awesome game",5
Fun game however systems are too layered to the point of overwhelming players if they don't have much time on their hands,4
I've been playing this sense release and before hand even preregister it and it progressively got worse over the updates. Sense I'm a veterinarian the endgame content isn't to bad but it took hell of a long time to get there and the summoned rates are terrible,1
Cute and addicting little gacha game. Very generous to start player off as well. If you like granblue fantasy you might just like this too.,5
"Gud, the soundtrack is so good and it is comparable to persona 5.",5
Dragalia lost is a gacha game that was made by Nintendo and Crygames. You play as a prince going out of his way to unite the kingdom through peace and vanquishing evil. However there are fiends in it he does have human enemies as well. That he refuses to have taken out. It's generally wholesome and very enjoyable. Fluid fighting with plenty of potential for dodging in combat as well.,5
製作者さんから話あります モンハンコラボを復刻してください! 入手したい人もいますから 私は、初めてやったことありませんので お願いします!!!,3
Theres a Bug that won't let me get past title screen,1
White screen ?,1
It lost my account I asked for help and there's was no way without proof of friends and ign. I lost all my limited event characters.,1
Good,5
I didnt get Ann during the Caged Desire Event and now I'm salty,2
Very fun and awesome persona 5 event,5
"Really love the game but two months ago I couldn't even start the game anymore, I can't click on anything and there is no music in the main menu I am heart broken since I love this game.",1
"App keeps crashing during loading screens. It actually crashed while I was using a 10fold summon ticket and when I deleted the cache and reinstalled the files, the gems were used up but I didnt see anything new in my inventory I want either a refund or an apology STAT. FIX THIS NOW!!! This is happened again and I missed the Persona crossover! Just play Genshin Impact!!",1
The Game size is thiccc,3
Yo I need help!!! For about 3 weeks in a row now the game won't start. It just stays in the title screen and I can't do anything its just unplayable. I don't know what happened and I don't know what to do please help.,1
The game is fun but I'm sinning improper display of differculty. A content should match the level you appointed it and not your herculean task differculty. Let's say something is 1300. If you are 2400 you should be able to beat it because you worked hard to. The differculty let's us know how we feel about a level. Don't play around with it. Casuals and hardcore have different requirements.,3
Pls make the screen land scape,5
"Every literal thing about it is god tier, especially the music choices",5
Persona 5 event ended so fast there was no need for me to even try this game.,1
It's really fun I love it but it takes up way too much space,4
poggers uwu,5
Wyrmite cut is a joke.,2
It takes a while to load and when you start playing the game it is really fun but there is a lot of dialogue and it gets boring after a while,4
I am in,5
Persona 5,5
"Been a daily free player (for the most part) since day 1. The story is great and the characters are likeable. Gameplay is also solid. The company has started making some very poor choices imo. The amount of free premium currency ($23 per 10 x summon) used to be at a reasonable amount. Hardcore players could grind and get rewarded. Now rewards from events are the equivilant to trash. I used to buy dragalia merch online; art book, soundtrack, and plushes. Now I'm sad to say I'm losing interest.",2
Game is pretty fun! Didn't think I would like it lol,5
its super,5
"I couldn't even open the game, also it takes 5GB to play.",1
"Too bad the size of this game takes up all the space on older phones.. consider a light version.. Looks fun, but since I cannot play you get this lonely star.",1
I like. More waifus pls.,5
"Addicting gacha aspects combined with a story that draga you in and upgrades that can keep you working for hours, and you've got the recipe for a great mobile game. Only wish Nintendo gave it more support in terms of advertising, but the crossover events so far were beyond expectations!",5
It's worth the amount of space it takes to download,4
"I was barely able to play the game since the game kept crashing and saying that the severs where down, but I was able to play after re-downloading the game but it was only for 1 hour I don't want to be re-downloading this app each time I want to play it.",2
"The gacha has gotten bloated and its harder to get newer units now. Not to mention they have cut the amount of free pulls down due to taking away ticket/wrymite rewards that you get from events. Really disappointing after the 2nd year anniversary. ALSO, PAYING $40 FOR A SINGLE 10 ROLL SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. WTH GAME, LOWER YOUR PRICES JEEZ!",1
this is a surfing game,5
This is a great gacha game,5
"I Have One Complaint, I Don't Have Big Enough Phone Storage To Play 🤣",5
Great game,5
"I'd honestly give this game 4 stars but Let's start with the positives. The story is fine entertaining even. Early on, the game showers you in its free alternative to its premium currency. However, emphasis on early on because once you have taken advantage of it for long enough, you're forced to grind only to get very miniscule amounts of it. This isn't a big problem until you run into an interesting event and are unlucky with the gasha pulls the game's momentum falters due to all the grind.",3
Useless. Can't even open the game.,1
Good so far,5
"Fantastic game which offers fun action gameplay without being too bogged down by having gear/level requirements, and upgrade material is pretty generously handed out. There's also a large cast of characters each with their own story to see and the world the game builds for you starts out simple, but you'll end up falling in love with the cast.",5
Pretty awsome,5
"This game has devopers who really care about the players and make sure they have a good time. edit: the games mechanics have become increasingly dull, boring and downright unwinnable in certain areas, end game agito is straight up impossible in pubs due to gate keeping and a system designed to punish new players, i originally gave it a 5 star but as of recently im rating it a 3",3
Simple and easy to learn. Good time killer,5
Good,5
Awesome game love it,5
"I cannot open the game after updated few days ago, and there is no update and fix released so far. White screen is shown after showing Nintendo logo",1
"Its a very fun game, good story line, and great characters.",5
"Great story really easy controls,matter of fact if you want can skip the campaign entirely if you want to for the people who want to get into the action with the option to read the story synopsis it's nice they give you this option. overall really good game",5
"Fun game, the crossovers are really interesting",4
I love the game but it takes up most of my storage this is the the third game I have because I cant download anything else because this game takes up all the space for it,3
Love it,5
"Its got a decent story line, and easy to understand to play.",5
Good game so far love the different variety of characters.,5
"Great game, but takes up wayyyyyyyy too much space",2
Pretty fun so far the gacha is also pretty fair. I like it.,4
I love it,5
pay to win,1
This game is beautiful and has a good roster set. If this game takes any type of suggestions for new adventurers that would be amazing! I have a few in mind!,5
thank you mr. lost,5
Very f2p friendly,5
game crashes way too much and makes me unable to play any events,2
I hate forced tutorials and so does most of the gaming community.,3
Great game they should do more crossover characters like link from legend of zelda,5
Fun action rpg!,5
Bro you get a 100000000000000,5
"Wow. I love this game. Amazing graphics, interesting storyline, and great style of combat. Only thing I'd suggest of now is more free roam throughout.",5
Fun action oriented mobile game,5
It is a gud game I like it you should download it dis is not a fake review,5
I like it and the persona 5 crossover,5
"very good mobile game. file size is kinda large, but it is undoubtedly very fun. pull rates are very generous especially for new comers",5
"Best game ever i hope you make more of these your inspiring to me and my family thank you, also this would be so much cooler if there was a anime adaptation of this game",5
"I have played a lot of the other gacha style games on this app store, and I can say with certainty that this is my favorite out of them all. Real skill based game play, high 5* adventurer summon rates, no duplicate heroes needed, Nintendo makes sure that this game is very free to play friendly.. All of those are the main reasons I love this game. On top of that the developers actually communicate with the playerbase monthly. Highly recommended.",5
Really fun to play😊cute artstyle ! Reccomend to people,5
Great game,5
Updated and became unplayable on my phone despite I have played this game for a year,1
Awesome gameplay love the chibi look but always have a hard time connecting or staying connected to a server,5
"I love how when your first downloading the game you have a chance to get many rare units, the game is voice acted and many other good things but the only downside is how big the game is but other than that id rate it a 5 star",5
Got on to see the persona crossover only to find out my account been wiped even though it was linked with my Nintendo account,1
I like this app it now has persona 5,5
Great game. I just wish there were some kind of rewards that you could spend your google points on.,4
I'm about a half hour in. Joined for the p5 event and have already gotten Mona and Arsene with no trouble. Very fun,4
It's a fun gotcha game. Plays well on a Galaxy S8+! I'm enjoying now. Just be careful. This game will drain battery relatively quick. But overall. A very good game! I highly recommend!,5
"2/21 - The summon rates are even worse now. I wanted to give it another try but it's a joke. The AI is horrible. When on auto every character but your own will dodge things. Yours however charges right into everything. Add in the abysmal summon rates, difficulty spikes, ridiculous upgrade costs and it's something to skip.",1
Great game its really fun to play and the ost is amazing,5
"Love the art and very fun to play, love the characters!!",5
"Best gacha game. User friendly, good gameplay and a decent story.",5
Loving this game top games on my list at the moment just pure amazing,5
"Great game so far but im trying to go back and do the chapters in hard mode but when I go back to previous chapters the game bugs out and all the text disappears, and the loading screen glitches out. Please help",4
"Day one player. While the game had its ups and downs it's gotten a lot better. Not the same generosity like in the first year, but definitely better than last year.",4
Pretty neat,5
"I really like it, it feels like a real game and not something just thrown on here for a cash grab",5
Lots of fun but often confusing.,4
This is the mobile Zelda,5
It's not a bad game to play on the phone it is fun but takes long loading time's when you log in,5
3rd time going in to the tutorial because of a gamebreaking error,3
A pretty fun game!,5
I've never been serious playing Dragalia lost before the Joker event. The game is pretty fun. Summon rates are okish. You get 1 x10 summon per day durring banners. Kinda nice.,5
It's a really nice game! I started playing today and it's really fun so far!,5
"Literally will not start. Like I tap when it says ""tap to start"" and it won't start",1
🔥💯🤜🤛,5
LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH,5
"This game is very fun. Normally I don't play through games that make you interact, but this is one I find I'll be playing often.",5
"This game felt like the closest thing to a Breath of Fire game, that I immediately fell in love with it! It's one of the very few mobil games that I've ever enjoyed playing. And while it is a Gacha game, it's a very rewarding one where I'm not fully forced to purchase anything with real money! Plus, it's a fun Action RPG with a pretty great story to boot! If your a fan of both Dragons & RPG's, then I can't recommend this game enough! 😍",5
"Great game, might be too late getting into",4
When i downloaded the game and opened it it started with a white screen and nothing happens,1
Rather good enjoyable easily character to get and because it's Nintendo some I know from other games,5
Amazing,5
I wasted my phone battery and 5 hours trying to download this game just for it to freeze on the last 5%. That is 5 GB of data I will not get back this bill cycle. Reason I deleted this game was the constant large updates as well. Always a GB or two.,1
Can't even get past the title screen. None of the buttons work so I can't review the game.,1
Trash,1
"The game is super fun, the gacha rates aren't that bad, and the story is amazing! I live the chibi style of the characters in battle, and the gameplay is fun and satisfying! It can get a little easy in the beginning if you upgrade right, but overall the game is amazing! On top of that, the character design and music is just astonishing! Very well done!",5
Came for persona 5 and stayed for a fun game,4
Pretty fun game so far. Just started and enjoying it. Heard good things about it.,5
"One of the best gacha games of all time. I've played Epic Seven, 7dsgc, Exos Heros, Honkai 3rd, Genshin, and more but non of them are as good. Its very kind and has great rates. Its story looks like not very much but its very deep the world building is great and the characters are very fleshed out. All in all best mobile game expirience.",5
Good,5
Rates are a lie. Burned far too much on this game. Quitting for a while after getting cucked by a single Poseidon at 9%. Should even have that in the pool if im gonna be honest. My hate for some things in this game are immesurable. Still fun though and one of the better mobile games. But I wanna kick someone in the company in the dick every time I get a duplicate of something that isn't on rate up that ruins the streak.,4
Great game just too much chibi,5
"This game is amazing with a long and interesting story with great gameplay. The only problems are that is takes about 7 gigs and coins have no value because I get them everywhere. Please allow them to useful for more than what they are now. I have about 1 million with no use except for upgrading stuff and that requires missions. This is also a gacha game but don't worry, the draw rates are amazing and you can mostly get whoever you want when drawing.",4
Poggers,5
I love it,5
Really like this game!,5
"The game looks fun, too bad I can't play it. Constant connection error when downloading batch data. I am attempting to play this on a Galaxy Note 10 Plus.",1
Pretty good,5
Prity good,5
"Every time i go in, it doesn't work. It stays on the loading screen forever.",1
If among us and fortnite had a kid then it wouldn't be this game. Still good though.,5
I just came here for the persona event,5
"Fun when you get who you want, still fun when you get something random, and easy to manage",5
Better than grand cross,5
The. Game. Take. Up. To. Much space!!!,1
It's super fun What if there was A a event with Mario because of Mario 35th anniversary,5
"It's such a great game, I enjoy playing it so much",5
Great gam3,5
Pretty good and really f2p friendly.,4
Cool. Please add Ryuji though.,5
Easy rerolls,5
"After seeing people describing the game as generous and fulfilling, I decided to give it a go. I enjoyed the short tutorial and made my way to the Summoning Tutorial where I've literally spend HOURS retrying to get some form of helpful reward. I believe either I'm incredibly unlucky or the drop rates are off because I'm getting 1-2 Gold characters out of 50, if I'm lucky. If I'm unlucky, I could either get 0/50 Gold or just useless duplicates of the same character.",3
Persona5 caged desire,5
"I used to play this game a lot and think very highly of it. The gacha was decent and progression was balanced pretty well without requiring extreme amounts of time. I dont know when and what happened but the gacha rates are not what they used to be and the have to be lying about it. I can go 10+ full pulls without a single featured or any other 5*. Also weapons were changed and turned into a grind fest. Nintendo has gotten worse with all of their mobile games, especially this and fire emblem.",2
"I don't want to beat down this game but I must. I was a day one player. The game had a simple crafting system & gameplay reminded me of MMOs. I also enjoyed the High End Trials a lot. My enjoyment was killed when the revamped the system in the 2nd anni. The grind was already quite much, which is 1 con & they made you grind more. To add on to that, they became greedy & started to cut the amount of gacha currency given. I've given money and am starting to regret it. Hope the new fans enjoy it.",2
I quit this game because multiplayer became agonizing since they don't know how to do a certain fight and wastes my time. Single player is just one big chore too. The summonings are good and they're generous at times but I can't stand playing this game anymore.,1
It's a decent game to pass the time.,4
Good game,5
I could've enjoyed it if it will load like bruhhh i was using a lower end phone then decided to upgrade my phone then suddenly i cant open the app and its stuck on the loading screen after the 2 names appear even when i restarted it is still stick in that white part... fix this pls,3
Fun game packed with content. Takes up ALOT memory for devices though.,5
"I can't play the game, the gameplay seems to be promising from what I saw in the trailer.",5
"Such an amazing game. I love it so much. Only issue I have is that everytime I complete a quest, my game crashes so I gotta constantly reload the game.",4
Very nice. Gacha mechanics feel forgiving early on.,4
Very fun game,5
"My favourite mobile and gacha game by a long margin. Gameplay is actually engaging, unlike many mobile ""auto"" games, and the devs are very generous too.",5
Not the best but not the worst,3
"Typical gacha garbage. Pay to win bosses, tone-deaf developers who only care about milking whales, and abysmal summon rates. Stay far away from this mess 😡",1
Fun and this is one of the most NON greedy Gacha game. They are super free to play,5
Pretty good,4
Love this freaking game,5
Kool game,5
fix rare boosts,2
One of the best free to play games here in the appstore.,5
I love this game as it very easy and forgiving to new players,5
OK nvm there's a sparking system.,5
such a beautifully designed game with a great story. my only complaint would be how much it cost to do a x10 summon,5
I love this game... Sooooo much,5
"I genuine love playing this game. There is literally nothing like it, the bubbly art style, the adorable characters. It's all great. Power creep and weapon grinding has brought the enjoyment down immensely for mex especially as of late. I will not be partaking in player progression any longer.",2
Great game with an excellent story and artwork. Gacha rates have decreased.,4
"So, after 3 years. I can say I have a love-hate relationship with this game. It's easy to get into, but the rates are sometimes complete garbage, and it's almost impossible to get into harder content without a dedicated group, and even then it's hard to deal.",5
"Love this game, but I'm having to change my review to a 4 star because of the severe drop in wyrmite. Even when Crescendo of Courage was added to the Compendium, the tickets were slashed. Makes me sad knowing that the generous month of free tenfolds was likely just an excuse to cut summoning currency for a while... atleast lower the price of diamantium from it's current ridiculous amount if you are going to do that. EDIT: still not fixed, getting worse even...",5
It just feels like I'm playing a game,5
The one mobile game where I don't actually feel the need to spend money OR that constantly tries to make me spend. A+,5
"Update: as the game has gone on, the amount of free premium currency has decreased and the game is frequently recycling old content. It's lost its initial charm. Fantastic game with constant QoL and content updates. Generous gacha compared to Nintendo's other mobile titles and is easy to get into but has tons of content to keep you busy.",4
"Day 1 player. Still going strong. Great game with some repetitive elements, but overall still a fun game.",5
It's come a long way since I first reviewed in 2019. The gatcha currency like all gatcha runs thin and the main item for upgrading endgame gear and adventures is obtained very slowly through summons. This makes catching up feel like something somewhat unachievable. Could be better without the stamina system considering it gives you so many free boosts that it feels like it's only there to be an annoying menu,3
After the game had updated to 1.8 my guess it did get fixed rather quickly although I did miss some of the Fire Emblem event so hopefully they return the event again or incorporate the gameplay into the event. Other than that this game is still good and with the better quality of life improvements plus the updates to build a better team make it much more replayable.,5
"In terms of gameplay, its awesome and super fun. But if you're the type to want to collect all the characters a gacha has to offer then be ready to shill out the big bucks because as a collector, this is not f2f friendly in the least.",3
Best game,5
"This is a very generous gacha game! As a beginner you get 50 puls that you can do over and over until you are satisfied with the result, no more re-rolling! Also 7 days of tenfold summons! on whatever banner is currently running. It has auto, and endgame is challenging but reachable! All adventurers are useful even the free story ones! There is grind if you want to min-max. Also this has live co-op play.",5
Dont play until they address the bogus daily rewards change Edit: a new endeavor for events was added encouraging daily quests that reward wyrmite. No address has been made which is still kinda uncool.,3
Decent game just be wary of the size (almost 7gb at this point),3
Fun game but takes a lot of storage.,5
This game was a 5 star game for me until they cut out the rewards by half if not more + they even increased the cost of making weapons and amount of grind needed for the end game content,1
This is hella blast,5
Nonstop crashing. Long loading times. Short dungeons. Enemies die too quickly. Maybe I started playing too late to understand why everything dies in one shot to only a few shots. Can't enjoy it either way because it won't stop crashing. Uninstalled for good only one day of trying to play.,2
Simple and interesting gameplay,5
ALSO...neat. But no global release yet...till then it's 0/5.,1
"This game is fun to play. As opposed to other gacha RPG, this is a live action game on a 3D map where you dodge and interact with the environment. The development team takes great care to make sure most easy-to-get characters are viable to use, not just the rarest ""meta relevant"" units, meaning you can clear end game with your favorite characters. This game is also generous with gacha material and events to keep you interested, and listens to player feedback to correct unpopular design choices.",5
I love this game but it will not stop crashing I can not enjoy this game if it keeps crashing,1
It's a gacha game that has actual game play I've played it for years and never spent a penny on it. It's still fun to play every now and then.,5
"Was a great game for the first year but events are overall always the same concept. Half the time they just used the same resources as old events and called them Summer or Halloween and used the same enemies and map. Reduced wyrmite given to players and amount of free rolls, locked the game to lower fps and then absolutely ruined the weapon system in 2.0 with what would have been a good system if not for the overblown ramp up in gold required.",1
I love the art and music.,5
Gucci,5
Levels are short and the casual rpg vibe is boring but none the less another well constructed game from nintendo,3
Good game.,5
Wont even dowmload.,1
"More than 2 years later, and this is still the best mobile game I've ever played. The storytelling is very good and the gameplay is smooth as butter. The graphics are fantastic and the audio is superb.",5
One of the few good gacha games out there. Has a good story and I think there is a good balance with the gacha system so the game can be enjoyed without paying money.,5
pretty fun game. Good rewards for f2p although it uses a second pay only currency which I never like.,4
I love it,5
Pretty good!,5
More collabs,5
Cute story and animations. I also love the music! Besides it's an anime game with dragons. What's not to like. My only wish would be to have the ability to play this on my switch.,5
"2021 and this remains the best phone game ive played. Not requiring money to progress through any content. events going all the time. Easy to play, quite a lot of content, and decent endgame if you want a challenge. Very hard to find a game more nicer in terms of free content and its character design and stories are quite good.",5
Cute and fun game everyone should try,5
The game has a great story.,5
This game is amazing you should download have played for 3 days straight,5
"Look i know it's a gatcha and it's logical for it to be a greedy, money hungry pay to win trash ""game"" but this is coming from the ""family friendly for the gamers"" company Nintendo...just let that sink in. This is a shallow disgusting game with a cliche horrible sorry of an excuse story the bad guys are seriously callled 'The Other'. Not expecting much from Nintendo anymore to tell you the truth",1
"Was pretty much the best game on mobile, until they make it impossible to get matching weapon and hero in gatchas.",1
Really Fun 😊💚💖,5
Awesome game,5
Grade A Pink Lemonade!,5
Nice . Dont get the feeling of p2w. But still early. But they are generous with the rewards and the grind rewards so far. For a gacha type. Its pretty good. I always prefer few game and pay when they do a good job and support them. Not the way around. I hate when they force pay walls or unfair advantages if you dont pay but still proclaim to be a free to play. But this one feels nice so far and typical hero story. Controls a little diferent to what I'm used to but it still works .We will see :),5
best game ever,5
Noice,5
I have this on my phone and now on my ipad this is the best nintendo game ever,5
The single best Gacha game on the market. A blast to play. Generous Devs make it seem worth your time even if you are F2P. No other game has been worth my time as much as Dragalia Lost. Edit 1/16/2020: It sucks to say but I'm dropping the game. It's not fun anymore. Barely F2P friendly. Summoning currency was gutted. Fights are slogs that don't even give worthwhile rewards. It was a nice 2 years. But the funs over now.,2
Came back to the game after a hiatus to find out the system was replaced??? The weapons I grinded so hard for even when I was low levelled was removed?? The game was great before that particular update and will remain as a good memory to me.,1
"Great game! Love the gameplay. It is really simple and not to demanding. The character designs are awsome, i love the anime feel to them. The game has amazing music.",5
🥳👌👌🥳,5
"I can confidently suggest this gacha game to any fans of the genre and newcomers. Dragalia Lost is a very welcoming and enthralling experience. The story is very entertaining and unique. The gameplay mechanics are unlike other gacha I've enjoyed (Summoners War, Raid, etc.) as it revolves around a semiautomatic top down ARPG, rather that turn based RPG. Gacha mechanics are present of course but there is a very generous amount of help provided early. In short I recommend giving it a try.",5
"Absolutely phenomenal, in story to graphics to gameplay. The fact that it is free makes it 100x better.",5
"The gameplay is good but the banner is never f2p friendly, they put collab unit behind a paywall.",3
"The game has been working fine for the past 2 years, but today it wouldn't let me get passed the title screen. I tried restarting my phone and I reinstalled the app itself, still nothing. Any way to fix this?",4
Lixo,1
What are you doing not enjoying this game?,5
"I jumped into this game because of the persona collab coming up to be honest, but I've had my eye on this game for a while because it seemed like a very interesting premise, so far the gameplay is smooth. Though the chibi art style bugs me it's not enough to ruin the experience.",4
The music is best part,5
"1/12/21 Update: Looking at more critical reviews, seems as though DL has taken a massive nosedive since the 2nd Anniversary. Updates being buggy, less currency rewards, gacha is clogged, more tedious grind, graphics look worse, etc.. A damn shame... Used to love this game before I bailed in the summer. Now I think this solidifies me never coming back anytime soon. Tmw a reboot might be your best option to save face. Just saying.",1
"Cannot enter the game, white screen forever.",1
It is a really good rpg and the gameplay is amazing,5
It'd be nice if this game had 3 difficulties in the storyline Easy Normal Hard then you could play with people your level. ^^ The game also heats up my phone frequently so I haven't been playing for a while now.,4
Very fun so far,5
"Just came back to this game that I love to play after a family issue and needed to do the somewhat-annoying-but-not-a-big-deal sizeable after-update download for the latest version. I let it do it, eagerly awaiting playing the game again to find that no matter what I do, the game takes hours upon hours to update. Last speed test I did came up 8 ping, 32mbps down and 22mbps up and yet, it's been 6 hours of downloading for just over 7% of the 3GB download which is absolutely ludicrous compared to how it used to take up to 30 minutes to download the whole thing every time. If this insane problem is rectified, I will return my review to reflect my thoughts on the actual content of the game as I truly did love to play this game before this happened.",1
"Fun, addicting, and easy to pick up on. Characters look cool, too.",4
Persona 5 STRIKERS:),5
Joker is coming in the next event so me like,5
Poggers,5
I used to play this game a lot but then it just suddenly stopped working for me. I cant get past the white screen that happens after cygames logo pops up. Im not going to reformat my phone just cause of this. I hope this gets fixed (yes i did try a lot of the stuff found in google etc),2
Fantastic game with great developing story.,5
"The music has absolutely NO RIGHT to be as good as it is. Combat is interesting, characters and their mechanics are unique. Grindy towards endgame, but that's what you're getting from a gacha game. Brilliant game.",5
It is so cool,5
"After sparking, cygames have been disgustingly stingy with event rewards Also stop dodging the wrymite issue on your monthly q&a give us a proper explanation for your newfound greed",1
"the game is okay, has a story line to it, and is engaging, the auto play feature is a plus. but the biggest bummer is that as you progress the drops dont change, so basically a lvl 10 player level 100 player will get the same drops from quests.",2
Game is a blast. The soundtrack is an unexpected bonus.,5
Love it a lot.,5
When I go in the game it says failed to connect but I have good internet and I can go on any app on my phone. Idk why I can't play this. Idk if its a bug but if it is pls fix because I'm really trying to play. I've done everything to restarting my wifi. My phone deleting and installing the game. But still not connect idk why I can't log into the game and play. But pls take a look into it.,1
"The game is easy to learn, super generous with it's handouts, colorful, the 3D is actually pretty good and kinda cute. The music and voice acting are amazing, and it plays vertical so it's easy to play on the go.",5
Fun,5
It's a rework if every other game. Except the first 3 hours of playing will be them explaining all the features. It's not fun.... it is boring work that you already put into a hundred other games.... bythe way their microtransactions start at $30,1
"The game itself is decent and I love the style but I only started it to earn the Achievements but when I cleared chapter one on normal I didnt earn it, i reset my progress and tried again but again didnt receive it. I personally wont continue playing but it is a good game.",4
I like dragalia lost it is a fun game it has the anime style story and the characters are very detailed but I wonder what part did nintendo play in this game was it like developing or editing,5
"Used to be great fun but an increase in special Gala banners (every two months to two monthly) and a sharp decrease in free currency makes it feel far more pay to win, you need a lot more eldwater which you mainly get through summoning. 300 summons to be garunteed the unit of your choice is also a ridiculous number that you need to be insanely unlucky to even reach and doesn't carry across banners which might've made it kinda good. Overall the changes made on the anniversary ruined a great game.",1
Cool,4
"The game is actually really good and I really like the selection of dragons you can pick and pair with the characters. And if it's not too much to ask, do you think you could bring back the Dread King Rathalos event? I didn't know the game existed at the time and missed it 😅 but aside from that I really love the game.",5
"The graphics and music are superb, and chara/dragon designs. Combat is funny, but Cygames difficulty is as frustrating as ever. Nonetheless, I came back after a year w/no intention of return for the Seimei/Gozu Tenno combo. Ikemen+muscle dragon combo is too sexy to resist. Got them on free draws/tic, but I may drop dollars for upgrading Gozu if my motivation to stick around is good. Hoping the difficulty for dragon trials is better balanced now at least.",4
Good Game!,5
Is good,5
Controls are a bit difficult but thats the phones fault. I absolutely love this game!,5
This game is the best game I have played on my phone,5
Is it now playable in phillipines??? Pls tell me i have been waiting this game 3 years now,1
I love this game is so addictive and I like the story and humor of the game.,5
"I've played for at least a year now and find myself playing more casually. Its an enjoyable game and has some actual in depth team buildings that I am too lazy to commit to, but it's got pleasing graphics to match my lazy autorunning. The game is quite generous with their summoning currency and events that I always take some time to out of the day to play a bit. I'm not personally a fan of touch screen movement, but it is quite responsive.",5
New event works fine on my phone but keeps restarting my tablet.,5
"It is a very cute and fun game, with very surprising good graphics.",5
"One of the most generous gachas I have ever experienced. Everything ranging from the story telling, graphics, gameplay, and music is excellent and is worth your time if rpgs are your thing. The devs/staff also really make an effort to listen to player feedback and thus balance/improve the overall experience of the game. The only minor issue I have is the fact that alliances have no functions apart from collecting the daily resources. Overall though, this game is most definitely worth a try",5
I came back to this game after a year or so only to find out most of my weapons are completely gone. Every weapon I grinded for and event exclusive weapons completely gone. I'm now too weak to even progress the story normally unless I carry on grinding. All of my Fatalis weapons I grinded for completely gone. I don't think I'll return to this game anytime soon. I don't understand why they removed them because now I'm just stuck with wooden weapons.,1
Fun 🎮,5
the best potrait rpg game for mobile!,5
Rewriting this review as an update. This game used to have limited banners with lots of free summons and materials. Now you have 3 days to get limited units and no tickets or wyrmite to summon. After those 3 days pass you have to wait an entire year. Don't even think of paying for wyrmite either. It is cheaper to make a car payment than buying enough wyrmite for a 10 summon. Take a note from dragonball legends. They give their customers tons of free summons and lots of time to try for limited.,2
Is there a matinence break because the game won't let me in.There wasn't a thing that said that the game was on a matinence break.,4
Great grindy game that receives a lot if attention from its developer.,5
"Great game with great developer, it's possible to play this game completely Free-2-play if that's a concern of yours, even though the game is 2 years old now, the developers made a lot of improvements to help beginners get up to speed and able to do the latest Raids if you're consistent enough with the game.",5
Good 👍,5
"I deleted it and reinstalled it again cause it had a bug that didn't refreshed the dragons i obtained from summons, but now i cant even get to the tittle screen cause it just freezes in a white screen. Please fix this, the game is now literally unplayable for me now.",1
Best mobile game and very generous dev. Great experience,5
GOOD GACHA RATES,5
cute gorls..........,5
Above average gacha game.,3
"I can no longer play, the entire screen goes black during combat. Graphics deload after switching through menus leaving ugly black squares.",2
I love this game and the gameplay. The music is also amazing. My biggest problem is how TOXIC the community gets when it comes to end game battles. Meta slaves make it hard to find a public room.,4
"I got this game back when it came out. Two years ago at the time of writing this. I played for about a year and a half before I lost interest. I'm gonna try the game again today because while I stopped playing, the game itself was good. It's quite friendly to free to plays in my experience, as long as your smart with currency you can get what you want. The protagonist is a flat character as of where I am in the story; but those around him are not.",5
"A fun game play, but is struggling to remain relevant and entertaining.",4
Love the dragons,5
"Ok, so I've held back from asking this for a long time - How did Nintendo get away with completely using Rune Story's... Everything? I mean the entire engine the game runs on is identical save for the dragon mechanic. One day a few years ago, I fired up Rune Story, and it was no more - searched in the store; POOF, gone. However the YouTube Videos, they're all in existence. So what happened, Nintendo? I don't want to sound down on you, I actually love the game. But, how did you slip this in?",5
"The games amazing, the gacha system is actually fair for once. My only complaint. Ive been playing for years, and rhe new update DELETED ALL THE WEAPONS! So all the Event weapons I was using are gone, maxed out the stats on them and everything, just to be punched in the face with a ""Oh we need a new weapon system."" YEAH, NO! What was the point in upgrading the weapons with unique skills for them to be removed and reduced to a mere skin. Utter Bull!",4
"Is really bad that they decide to cut support with devices with 3 RAM and lower, it didn't make sense for a mobile game, I even bought a new device for this game to show my dedication but I have notice since the 2nd anniversary the game have been decreasing the free rewards (summoning currency) by a lot. Is not that f2p friendly since the new director and the player base is way too stingy with meta characters by not letting you play Co-op unless you have them and build them like they want.",3
"There's just not enough challenging solo content available. It's a fun game, but its end game is exclusively co op and the player base is elitist and refuses to play with you even when youre adequately geared for it. And now, on top of that, they have cut down on free currency harshly. This game has gone downhill fast.",1
Very reminiscent of Granblue Fantasy with a lot of quality of life changes. Very fun game and good story. Progression is very steady even for F2P players.,5
"Honestly, this is the best gacha game ive played and the only one im willing to keep up on. The game's super generous and I really did fall in love with the cast and the world of Dragalia.",5
"I'm having issues regarding summoning, when i go to summon it gets stuck on the loading screen.",5
Amazing,5
I've been playing since week 1. Phenomenal game with a lot of very distinct characters. The story is great and the events are outstanding. By far one of the best mobile games I've ever played.,5
"This game is very nice. It doesn't really center around what units you have but instead what you equip them with which is nice. 4* characters can be just as good as 5* characters. Gameplay is refreshing, game is very rewarding. Been playing for about a year and a half",4
Started playing again right before the 2.0 update and everything was super nice. They added sparking(wyrmsigils) but chose to reduce wyrmite rewards as well without informing players. Scummy move.,3
This game is really fun and addictive. The gameplay is simple to learn and the constant updates to events and stories help keep it fresh.,5
Just dont summon until the final day and check the Twitter element summons are better,5
"A good game, but the generous wyrmite rates were slashed, which kind of hurts",4
Been here since the game started and can say it has improved a severe amount. It's easy to fall in love with the characters and the gameplay is really fun for a phone game.,5
One of the top games ive played id say!,5
"This looks and plays great! I don't like the fact that you cannot move the entire application to the SD card, however. I found the same issue with Fire Emblem heroes. Please make it possible to move the entire application (including the data) to the SD card.",5
Love the characters and story telling. Looks great too. Game is generous with goodies so you don't feel much pressure to buy stuff. Definitely worth trying out if you haven't yet.,5
Good game with great balance..you dont need pay to win..and i really enjoy the character design,5
For those are fans of rpg's. It's really fun and and addicting. But my one complaint is the glitches.,5
It fun and creative,5
this game is awesome,5
"Fair gacha, easy to get into, not too tedious to navigate, and deff worth the play.",5
What was once an enjoyable experience ruined by gameplay that is more tedious than ever and cuts to summoning currency that still remains unexplained to this day. The game is on a continuous downward slope and it just seems to keep going down that slope. I hope the best for this game but the developers aren't making it easy.,2
Don't start a second event and then have maintenance for more than 8 hours!,1
"Beautifully made game with really addicting gameplay, and endgame have more things to do which makes it not boring unlike some other games. Though as much as a gacha game it is, the summon rates is really good compared to others(4%-6%, depending on the event), not to mention they are really generous with their summons as well! Would reccomend!",5
"They seriously need to nerf Volk, he is just...too much.",5
"Fun so far, doesn't seem super p2w either",5
Why contain it? S'cool.,5
Great game. But stop changing the the summons out so fast! Or at least keep it for a bit to give us options! How can i have chance to get a event character i want if its availablitiy its onky up for 3 days! Do better and ill change my rating!,3
Developers would rather ruin the actually-good gacha experience than fix mechanical issues with the game. Used to be great. Do yourself a favor and play something from a developer that actually cares.,1
"Gameplay is fun, game is horribly mismanaged. I started playing at release, and finally quit after over two years. It's very sad to see, but the devs clearly don't know what to do with the game to fix the major problems with balance. New content is just old content with more HP, and summoning income was massively nerfed. Game is no longer worth starting or continuing.",2
"Sparking system is MAJOR a mistake, you DARE slash wyrmite/ticket amount by MORE THAN HALF just so YOU can fulfill ppl who want a sparking system?? Gbf has spark but NEVER slashed crystal/ticket amount. No excuses smfh. FIX THIS GDI",1
"Use to be so in love with this game, been playing since 2018 and unfortunately im forced to cut ties. It was no good reason to discontinue support for 3GB RAM's and frankly with a 4GB supported device, the game is still ultra buggy. 5 to 1 stars just like that..",1
It's really fun and cute.,4
Amazing game! Really fun with a great story mode. Downside is it takes up a lot of space. It also runs slow on any older phones. But that's worth it for such a great game.,5
Good game easy summons and alot of fun it needs some updates though....one of the things it needs is more summons and new dragons like a super dragon even bigger than the green dragon like an evolution.,5
"used to like this game but realized it has issues. the gameplay is awkward thanks to its half responsive controls, the story is just a giant example of yanking the dog's chain, and there are metric tons of arbitary mechanics that add fake depth with their true purpose being huge time and money sinks. all these issues and I didnt even mention the gacha. I even got walled off from a later part of the story because of those fake mechanics. Avoid this game.",1
Utrecht in business for the frizzy mess 0,5
Pretty good.,5
I like the game and the characters,4
Its ok.,5
Gaming,5
I'm kinda scared the direction of this game after 2nd Ani. Less free summon with more confusing content. Why? What happens to the dragalia director?,1
"Hands down, best f2p gacha game on the market. Everything about this game is amazing. Great story, great battle system, unique and interesting characters. I really appreciate all of the crossovers, like monster hunter and fire Emblem, etc.",5
Stays on a white screen after showing the CyGames and Nintendo logos.,1
"I've been having fun so far. Action combat is unexpected from a mobage, and also I got a cute sexy rabbit man",5
This game is awesome,5
"Very good, it's so fun to play",5
"Since the revamped 2.0 update, the game has gone downhill. Sure, it looks pretty, but that's about it. They've put more focus into random Gala banners to entice people to spend more money. They used to be bimonthly but more they happen twice a month at minimum. They used to give more free summon tickets as rare drops in fights and they have stopped them from dropping outright. They are turning towards greed. I've spent a fair amount of money on this game and after these changes I'm done.",1
Srandard summoning system and gear is just enough depth one thing that is bad would be the movement of characters,4
Edit: Heard they cut currency so I lowered the score accordingly. Reviewed based on pre 2nd anni.......Top tier mobile game. Very good gacha game. Very easy to get the character you want from gacha even without spending money. Endgame content hard for people that don't want to take the game too seriously or interact with other players (speaking as one of these people). The pure gacha aspect about it though is perfect. Takes up way too much space even without voices (at least 4 GBs).,3
"Great game, excellent story, definitely not p2w and generous in giving out wyrmites (gems for gacha), characters, and their equipments. Best gacha mobile game i have ever played",5
"I can't think of any better mobile game that care about their players, everything is just so good the music, the story, the alberiant battle now is better than before too, every single aspects are amazing and since the release of legend volk the difficulty is just perfect 2 days for clearing legend volk in legend and i wasn't even tired you just want to keep on going until you beat him excellent work for the legend agito and the music in this fight is just beautiful. Support this company 👍🏻",5
"Played for a year and got bored. Story is very stock anime tropes which isn't necessarily bad, but here it's just boring. Feels like devs don't know what to do with the story and just keep drawing it out instead of using new ideas. Gameplay is quite fun and easy to figure out. Never had much issue with draw rates and they have quite a few events. I just got burned out and bored.",2
Fun to play in the beginning but gets boring very quickly - and also this game has been getting worse for f2p players just as a warning if you dont whale.,1
Pretty fun but it lags and cutscenes sometimes break. Though that may be due to me using an older phone,4
It better now,4
Great game! Revolutionary mobile gameplay. Been playing since day one and have had a blast ever since. Alot of people complaining about the recent summoning resource cut. Dissapointed in the community backlash when they know that their previous generosity would not keep the game funded. Love sparking though.,5
"Man, the developers listen. My last review really complained about the filter system for Wyrmprints, and what do I find one day while team building? A fixed filter system. Add on top of it the ever evolving gameplay, and there's going to be years of content to come. Most people seem upset at some sort of cut in Wyrmite (The game's limited currency). Personally, I didn't notice it. However, these kinds of concerns are legitimate, and I'm sure the Dragalia team will address them, just like all of the other issues that have cropped up in the past. For instance, we used to have to summon for Wyrmprints, this not only made the summon pool more diluted, it also falsely got our hopes up when we saw the legendary rainbow summon circle. The dev team noticed, and changed it. Wyrmprints were moved to loot drops. But that was still too rare for a fundamental item to the game, so the devs again changed it so that we could use eldwater to buy them from the shop. This was AGAIN changed with the latest update, now, you can just buy a single copy of each Wyrmprint, and then worry about getting more copies and upgrading them in their own menu, instead of having to keep track of what Wyrmprints you have, how many you have, and how many you need to buy. TL:DR: If it's broken right now, send in a report asking for a fix, the dev team will get to it.",5
sarisse is on the case,5
Orsem,5
"This game is pretty 👌. Offers a pretty unique experience and provides a wide variety of events that all work around the Gacha and co-op aspects of the game. I'm loving everything this game serves me right now, so I hope it keeps going.",4
"It used to be great, but it has really taken a hit recently. The generousity that DL was known for is diminished, and they quite literally just copy pasted an old boss into new content. Avoid for now",1
"getting dupe 5* feels so unrewarded 8,5k eld water aint match with freaking 2% draw chance",1
"Doesn't work, I've been trying to download it and play it since I used to play it a few years back, but now it doesn't work and just sits on a silent title screen.",1
Even know what when I post this I haven't installed it yet but I actually might have a good time that's why it's a 3 🌟,3
"I've been playing the game for 2 years, I've spent no money on this game and I don't intend to the game give you enough free stuff for you to set off on your adventure I have almost all the best units and dragons this game is fun a far (in my opinion) if you enjoy Games like Pokemon Dungeon or Final Fantasy World then you will enjoy this game",4
"Gameplay, art, animation, music are all amazing. Main story was meh but is getting better, and event and character stories are good. Characters are interesting and diverse. People complain about updates but most of them are too lazy to try to understand them. It doesn't actually set people back as much as they think, they just don't know the game and update well enough. However, the game is not as generous as before with summoning currency. Everything else is great and it's still worth playing",4
Returning player here. Cant login because of blank screen after nintendo and cygames splash screen. Can I get a refund instead?,1
Used to be a great game with great generosity toward free to play players. Then they sneakily removed 90% of the typical rewards of summon tickets and in spite of tons of player protest to this move pretend nothing has changed.,1
"I played this game for two years. I loved this game when it first came out. It was a lot of fun. Now it is a different game. More emphasis on boss fights. Endless boss fights. Repeat content is getting dull and boring. Pvp was added and its nice I guess but I personally never cared for it. I want the adventure back. Anyways, I had enough. I hope you enjoy the game though. It has a lot of charm and heart.",2
"I've been playing this game since the fire emblem collab in april and I loved it! However the recent summoning currency cut is really hurting this game, I understand it's because of the sparking system but there's just so little currency in events and in general now I just don't feel motivated to play, I hope this gets addressed because I really do like this game and it'd be sad to see it go down in flames!",2
Gutted summoning resources,1
Greatly reduced free summons after 2nd anniversary.,1
Hey the maker of this game please marry me is super Awesome and Cool😊🥳 I hope you Have a nice day everybody and stay save😸,5
Become extremely stingy and not rewarding. Will not recommend.,1
okdcringe,1
"Used to love this game, was my favorite game to play for two years. Then they gutted rewards for their events so we can't summon anywhere near as much, all while requiring ridiculous grind requirements for endgame. And did it all during their anniversary so we wouldn't notice. Would be a five star game if not for that, don't support these kinds of practices.",1
The art style is very cute. but I couldn't even download the game. After the tutorial it tried to download but kept getting errors I've checked my internet connection multiple times and restarted multiple times as well. It's a shame I wasnt able to even really play the game,2
Severe drop in free premium currency.,3
"Garbage piece of trash.. 1) Laggy, low fps 2) Game has no goal, like whats the point of playing this garbage? 3) Again, garbage game",1
fantastic RPG game. Reason I dropped to three stars because we having less wrymites,3
Beautiful,5
Fix the bugs creator i hate the bugs its not letting me even play,5
"It's cute, fun, and got a great soundtrack. Nice job Cygames.",5
It's pretty fun and the game is more stable now than when it first came out. I do love this game but it's not as f2p as it used to be,4
"Great game, cute dragons awesome art. Fun to play tons of events. Interesting story Great comic strip. They work hard to make the game better and better.",5
Don't get me wrong I love the game. But things have been going downhill for a while now. The Devs has continuously try to make the game easier. Making it rather boring in terms of content. Even agito fights are like that. Its either you can beat the content or you can't. 90% of the time you can. They do a great job at making units though.,3
"Anniversary update is a mess and wyrmprints are a terrible user experience. The battle royale is a half baked cash in on the genre. This update clearly didn't go through user testing. All that said, this is the most generous mobile game I've ever played in terms of summons.",2
I have to drop a star despite it's a good game. I never get any Gala units and only get it if i buy it and do platinum summoning. It needs to be checked.,4
"It would be a 5 star but the problem is that sometimes when I'm not doing anything, the game will crash for no reason and everything i did before didn't save. But other than that, a very decent game.",4
"Good game, but the devs have decided to neuter the currency distribution while rapid firing banners.",2
Pog,5
"Logged into game to find out im stuck in a black screen with game music going. So, I uninstall and reinstall it to find out the game works but my entire roster of heroes are gone. Signed into my account and everything but nothing. I hate this so much. 2 years gone just like that",1
"One of, if not the best mobile game I've ever played.",5
"Now is a perfect time to get started in the game, with the massive 2.0 update.",5
"Considering this is a free game, it is really good with the content and the amount of effort the developers put into it also a big plus for me is that you don't get spammed by adverts or ""ooo please buy our in game currency and you can continue playing right now"" like you would with most mobile games. My only ""gripe"" is probably that I have several adventurers that I have yet the need to use so they are kinda just sitting there but they seem to be slowly addressing that. Overall really good game",5
It has great plot and character,5
"I'm VERY close to deleting this game. I don't WANT to cause it's fun and I love the characters, but the amount of memory it demands, ESPECIALLY after a graphics overhaul that I think made the game look WORSE yet cost MORE memory, is ridiculous.",1
everything is perfect this is the best game out for any mobile device,5
The generosity and devs listening to feedback made me excited to return to this game once i got a device that could fit it. Only issue with this game is how much storage it takes up and how much it drains the battery.,4
exceptional game. very generous with free loot and gameplay is well balanced and fun. update: Still playing and it's the best mobile game I've played yet. Updated: unfortunately the free summons currency has been reduced significantly and it's much harder to stay f2p without having to constantly save wyrmite.,3
When I go to mana circle its an endless loading screen,2
"A simple touch-controlled hack-and-slash action RPG, Dragalia Lost is one of the most fun, most rewarding, most generous ""gacha""-style games I've ever played. The roster is humongous - over 200 unique Adventurers - and CyGames has constantly updated and enhanced even the free, common, and uncommon characters to keep them close in terms of strength and utility to the rarest of summoned Adventurers - and some of the more easily-obtained Adventurers downright outperform their peers in co-op.",5
The game in it's self is great but Cygames really makes the game shine on how they respond to issues immediately. The game is fun addicting and has all the qualities of a hunting/dungeon crawler with a small castle town you can upgrade to raise units stats! Edit #3: The game keeps getting better! Edit 4: I've since quit the game but I recomended it either way an experience I dont regret,5
The controls are bad,3
"This game would do better on the Switch/PC. The app size is too large to have on most devices, which is a shame because this game has incredible content. My advice: wait to see if this game gets ported, otherwise you're just straining your device.",1
This game has it all. From characters to all kinds of dragons and weapon skins too.,5
It's a real good game,5
"I change my review, ever since your revamp, everytime during updates there always network error, when I have no issue on all others games, only this. Fix this already, it been like this for year.",3
One of my favorite mobile games still to this day and I'm excited for the princess connect collab and hopefully other cygames crossovers,5
"I've played Dragalia Lost for a long time due to the art, music, and lovable characters. Cygames is a great developer that is super generous with summoning currency. That said, it doesnt get 5 stars because of personal gripes. The game grinds to a halt towards the end. The game also takes itself more and more seriously every update; what was once a casual and fun experience is now about beating tough endgame fights. The simple, cute story is getting more and more convoluted as well. Not a fan.",3
Fun. Nice music and graphics,4
Removing rewards from events is not the way to keep the user base happy.,1
Wont even load. Hard pass on this one guys,1
"Wow! There is so much depth to this game, so much storytelling, so many events!.. Truly a wonder.",5
I usually don't play RPG's but this is different not just because its Nintendo because its controls are simple enough to understand and its also a good game to pass time fast and the game is just beautiful,5
Game is cute,5
"The game has been great since launch, a great story and fun gameplay, and that is still there. But the developers suddenly got stingy with summoning material dropping it down to about 40% of what we once got making summoning and keeping up with the frequency of new banners impossible without whaling. This makes the game impossible for new people to get into. The game takes a lot of grinding for upgrade materials but having strong dragons and characters is a must, we are unable to get that now.",2
"This game used to give out summon currency (wyrmite and summon vouchers) very generously, but recently lowered the amount you can get every event, which has hurt a ton. Now events feel like I'm jumping through hoops for peanuts. The combat is fun, the story is ok, the characters are very likable, but since the drop in wyrmite and vouchers income most of the draw this game had has dissipated. I'll update this review if they change it.",3
"Top-tier game for me. Writing is phenomenal. Spite being relatively PG-13, it's leagues ahead of many, many other gacha games. Current rerun of New Year's is hilarious; hands down best event story for me. Gacha system is the friendliest I've encountered thus far. Farming is autoable, but boss-content requires thinking and quick fingers. I recommend joining the community discord for optimal co-op matchmaking.",5
"Developers more than halved the amount of free summons/draws available from the game by trying to hide it after anniversary, BEWARE",1
The game is awesome and i love the music,5
Nintendo really stepped up the phone games,5
Haven't played this game in over a year but I'm about to play it again. I remember it being a great game. 10/10,5
"It's cute and fun for what it is. There are definitely some P2W elements but if you don't expect that in a mobile game by now, than I dunno what to tell you. It is a large game though so keep that in mind.",5
Storyline just jumps all over the place. Huge gaps. They ruin the entire game because they can't tell a whole story. From one chapter to the next there's a huge chunks of story missing.,1
Pretty fun,4
I csnt update it,5
"Beautiful, fun, both easy to play in long or short sessions.",5
Cute art and fun game play make a great combo,5
Fun game different play style but very interesting. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a new summon game.,5
Great game.,5
"Honestly best game for free to play people, I've never spent anything on this, and I don't feel like I need to",5
Pretty nice.,5
Just cool,5
I've been looking forward to playing this but I was only able to play it once. And now every time I open the game it crashes. I'm so sad I have to uninstall. I was so excited 🙁,1
Why are my characters t-posing?,4
"I have never reviewed a game before, and while my old phone was too weak to take it, on this one only my phone's processes impede the experience. The controls and graphics are fluid, the story engaging, and the gameplay rewarding in material and psychological aspects. Further, the MTX aspects are optional and non-intrusive to a degree that other games have trouble living up to, if they even try. This is what a mobile game should be.",5
"Great gameplay, easy to play. The only problem is the data. The amount space needed on either a tablet or phone is really ridiculous. I have 16gb on my phone along with a 32gb memory card. It still wasn't enough space. I would have to delete all of my other apps just to download this one. Looks like I'll just be getting a new tablet and downloading it on that if I really want to play it.",5
The controls are fine is just hard to use I never had these control before on any game,5
Cannot install game on the S20. Menu starts with no sound and I cannot interact with it. AT&T variant.,1
Awesome,5
Great game so far. Love the graphics and story. The fighting mechanics take some getting used to but all in all great job. P.S. it is fantastic that its vertical. One handed play is a plus.,5
So over games that have huge hidden patch files.,2
"I haven't played much, but I like it.",5
"I have a Nokia 6.1 up to date with Android 10 but I can't play this game because I ""only"" have 3gb of RAM. Please tell me why ios devices only need 2gb minimum and not android. And also why you think this is at all fair to people who may have sunk money and time into this.",1
This game is perfect from the story to f2p friendly.,5
i never rate games but I just had to for this!!!! it's the most fun game I've ever played and I will keep ok coming back to it!! it's great to play when I come back home. the story is amazing and the music is also amazing !! 5/5 stars 100% recommend this game!!( Although my only problem is the loading times. Once I had to uninstall the game at the start because the game wouldn't load.),5
Sweet game,5
Fun,4
"The game has improved quite a bit with connectivity since release as well as control issues. Summoning rates are still trash, but not quite as bad as they were thanks to the changes they made to wyrmprints. Overall, still a good game, but be preared to spend if there's a specific character you want.",1
Newest update killed this game for me after supporting it for two years. Only whales enjoy this game now. All the grinds became tedious and all the metas are pretty annoying. The whole farming experience turned into auto simulator. Events barely give any wyrmite or single draw tickets now and they greatly increased the farm for weapons and such. Also the new sprites don't look nice anymore. I still can't believe they made a battle royale mode which is pretty terrible very boring and laggy.,1
Fun game overall,5
"Game descriptions do not include the damage% mods, leaving that job to datamining. Release a new hyped dragon that has rate up for 5 days. Dataminers find damage% mods to be pitifully weak. 4 days, 23 hours and 40 minutes later it gets some unspecified buff because it was ""bugged"" (how does a bug change the damage value to be 1100% rather than 1700%, >testing), leaving just enough time to pull the banner but not enough for it's stats to be datamined. Classy",1
"Good characters, fun game lopp",5
"I can compare this to Fairy Tail, but better",5
Really polished and fun dungeon crawler!,5
4gb ram min requirement now to play this game. Please buff brunhilda and high brunhilda or Make a gala version that has her bigger with bigger wings and a little bit fatter body.,5
Great game,5
"The game won't start, it gets stuck at the main menu in a black screen before the daily stuff",4
"I haven't played Dragalia in a while, and was railroaded into crafting weapons immediately. I thought, ""Okay, they're forcing me to do this because it's a new mechanic, but that's fine."" I spend time crafting some weapons, getting used to it, and go to outfit my teams. I find that all of the previously attained top-tier weapons were GONE. I worked hard and got my butt handed to me many times to earn them, and POOF! You could have let me keep my things, jeez!",1
"Has everything you could ever want in a game, while still remaining fun and accessible to casual players. Very fun.",5
My screen always gets stuck at after the title page. Its just black with notte at the bottom right. I couldnt play for the past 3 days because of this.,3
Good,5
game is unplayable after recent update,2
game is unplayable after recent update,1
A gacha game that isnt too scummy. Good controls and cute style. Would give more stars if could.,5
Great game. 4 star because I don't like the changes made in the 2nd anniversery.,4
"A good gatcha game that's generous with its free content. Unfortunately lost all progress when briefly uninstalled, which is a big issue in a game about collecting.",3
seems interesting but I wish there was a female main character,4
"Devs who listen to player's feedbacks. 2.0 has revamped the game with new graphics, mode and many QoL but wrymites has been reduced 4/5...",4
"I'm having a blast!! I cant believe that Im playing a Nintendo game again!! Im very happy with the game, and how the controls work.",5
"Game is Good, but recent updates have been deployed in increasingly broken states and coupled with the game having a very bad updater means a bad time is in store for you if your game decides to break.",1
"Game is great but ever since they upped the system requirements have had random crashes. I'm so sorry I'm to poor to buy an over 100 dollar phone to play a free mobile game. It shouldn't have to be graphically amazing, its a phone game for heaven's sake!",2
I had to redownload the whole game (3-4gb) multiple times just to fix infinite loading during game boot. And this is not the first occasion.,1
Having a great time playing.,5
Top 2 mobile game and it and #2,5
Fun,4
"It's an RPG game, and i love it.❤💒",5
Such a great game in every aspect,5
"Horrible customer service!!! Lost Mega Man after using him exclusively, up until earlier today. I optimized my team for a certain event, and when I went to put him back in, he wasn't in my collection. He was the only reason I played the game. And they refused to help me, even though I did everything I was supposed to do to keep using him after the event. Thanks for saving me room on phone as this game is too big anyway.",1
"Great and fun game. Very player-friendly, and there are a lot of goodies oh, some free just for logging in, and some to earn on a daily basis to help along the way. I am very happy with the way this game is run!",5
"There's so many lovable characters and personal stories for them all, I have over 100 adventurers and still find them all very unique. 10/10",5
"Really bad time to get into the game right now, just dramatically cut down on the summoning resources. Not f2p friendly anymore if this continues.",1
Havemt played a game this extensive since brave frontier tbch,5
Classic adventure game with lots of options,5
Quick support and fun character designs. I like it a lot!,4
It's pretty good,5
"Very fun to play, the music is really good and the rewards are also very generous. Overall an awesome game.",4
One of the best gacha's ive played in terms of quality and gameplay.,5
Nice gameplay,5
So far so good!,5
"Generally a very fun gacha game. Can be a little frustrating with banner pulls, but that's all gachas in a nutshell.",5
"Fun, Great story, And *EXTREMELY* F2P friendly.",5
"One of the best mobile games I've found so far. With free ten pulls daily, tons of events, and overall fun of it makes me love it. Good job devs with this one.",5
Amazing I liked the last update but it rested my weapons,5
Yuhhh,5
Very good! 👏👏👏,5
"very fun and addictive, cant stop playing, however the space it requires is a bit much but overall its a good game to play",5
"Horrible lag, loading screens and network downloading problem. I really loved this game but now is really useless. I will miss it.",1
"As gotcha games go, Dragalia is pretty fair with its resources. Very nice art style, cool music, good story and characters.",5
Rich story and excellent game mechanics! Music by DAOKO and made in collaboration with Nintendo. What more can you ask for?,5
"Fun as hell, JPN original voice over is fully voiced 😀",5
"Changing my review. The devs used to be generous and responsive. But now that they removed more than half of the currency and summoning tickets you can earn in game for a ""spark"" system which will only benefit whales I can't stand by my old review. Everything takes a lot more grinding and resources that we no longer get much of. I understand they want us to buy their game packs and premium currency but this isn't the way to do it. This gacha no longer stands out above the rest.",2
Like like like!,5
"I'd say overall the game is generally visually appealing, events are possible to do without having to pay money into the game which I enjoy and the music is pleasing. The story is a bit typical but not the worst I've seen. The summon rates are decent to me as I don't mind getting duplicates but I can see how it puts people off. However I do wish there was an better way of upgrading, especially with unbinding as this can be troublesome. Controls are a bit off sometimes but seems like a good game.",4
"Im obsessed with this game. Ive been playing since day one, and its really been a fun journey. Story mode and boss fights are a great time killer.",5
Good story and music.,5
okada sucks. replace him ASAP.,1
"A good gacha game, but be warned on very tough summoning percentages.",4
Updates seem to listen to the requests of the playerbase.,4
"I love the gameplay with its emphasis on skill, art is clean,a lot of voice acting and my goodness THE MUSIC is so catchy. Also one of the most generous f2p games now.",5
Only complant is that you can't skip stories in the main story. Yeah you can skip the campaign but I personally enjoy the battles just wish I could skip the stories and come back to them for a catalog later.,4
The game has a great soundtrack and a very thorough tutorial. The interface looks great.,5
"This game is overall pretty good. While I have some very minor gripes, like lack of eldwater or sunlight stones, those are overall pretty friendly. Compared to other gachas, this game is f2p friendly with good odds. The combat and bosses are fun, and graphics are solid. This is a very solid gacha game, and I'll be playing this game for ages",5
"support emulators, then we'll talk.",1
Excellent game! I love the character designs and the story!,5
New updates made everything more streamlined and easy to see progress. Still incredibly generous with free goodies and enjoying the game again.,5
"This game is lots of fun! The story, music, characters, and quality of life features are really great! This game is so insanely generous that you wouldnt even know its a gacha!",5
I've been playing this game since launch and I will probably play this game until they shut the servers down.,5
Been playing from the first week. The game is always getting better and it's very beginner friendly. Does not require a large time investment. It's challenging for end game content if you want it to. Gacha system is very lenient. Story and characters are great! One of the few mobile games I stuck with.,5
"My first Gatcha; a great intro into the genre. Little to no pressure to spend money, and little reason to do so too as the DL team are very generous with gifts.",5
POGGERS,5
Fix the money and sand issues,3
Great game with great graphics and gameplay and the developers are responsive and very generous to the player base,5
Redo i found my character sorry! Everything is going swell so far very Dope RPG!,5
I like it,5
10/10 like the game,5
"Absolute best mobile ""gacha"" game. Very involved and caring developers. Thank you for such an awesome game. Please don't ever sell out lol",5
Best gacha ever played.,5
Top Notch!,5
I almost forgot about this game,5
It's really good!,4
How did I miss this gem of a game for 2 years?,5
need mroe chrom please,1
"The in game download was ridiculous and it kept telling me ""try again"" wish they would fix this",1
I played this game day one I lost my progress but I came back to speed run.,5
A very well designed rpg with beautiful character design. A fun playing experience with a very generous draw rate. I highly recommend it 👌,5
Ha. Gatteem,4
Is there a way to recover saved file if you connected to your Nintendo account,4
So far it's a decently fun game. I've only played a little but of it though,5
Can even play the game. Tells me to try again when I have a secure internent connection....my internent connection is just fine. Very sad that I can't try it. Any suggestions on what I can do? :(,1
Amazing!!!,5
Great Game to Play,5
"I love this game and I have been playing for about a year but for the past few days when I go to summon the game freezes. Please fix this. Other than that, I love this game Good job!",5
The most forgiving gatcha game (in terms of doing pulls). Im level 150 in this game and I barely suffered in getting characters and very rarely felt like i wanted to whale. Gameplay has a surprising amount of depth to it as well. Controls are mostly fine except for specific character playstyles which may feel a little annoying as well as some end game content being frustrating to coordinate in public lobbys.,5
I always like these kind of games but I never have the space for them they take up so much room it's beautifully crafted it looks amazing I guess it's my point to that it plays pretty well they have Auto and manual and I don't really mind that usually irritates me when they have games with auto like this but it's really aesthetically pleasing so that kind of helps with it and if you like to micromanage like I do there's tons of that,4
🤩,5
Such an amazing game created by people that care about it.,5
"Amazing game! Very generous. Great characters. Very attentive developers. It's the only mobile game I've played where the fan base is generally happy. Any issues are quickly fixed and player suggested features are actually added. Been playing since launch. The new features take some getting used to, but I think they are good for the overall health of the game. Highly recommend! Also, the music is fantastic. I'm a DAOKO fan now.",5
"Been playing since day one and I gotta say, its my favorite mobile game out there. Time has only made this game better and it looks like the developers are really putting time out to keep the game growing. The game is very friendly to free players and it doesn't require you to use a single dollar to get good. 10/10",5
"The most amazing game I have ever played! The dedicated team, wonderful characters, beautiful stories, they all come together to form this masterpiece of a game. Thank you for this gem!!",5
"The story is pretty much your usual fantasy/anime tropes. Gameplay and graphics are great, although takes up a lot of memory. And the soundtrack is amazing. I have had fun playing Dragalia Lost, but the world's lore isn't really fleshed out properly which can be annoying in my experience. And the end-game quests are just knowing the boss's attack patterns while having overpowered damage dealing adventurers. It can be frustrating to find a room without players shoo'ing you away for using adven...",2
Amazing,5
I love this game! Because it has good graphics and its not laggy so I think this should get a higher rate!! Its very challenging and fun so anybody can play it! My friends love it 😀 it took them a while to get used to it but they enjoyed it plus I've been looking for a game in appstore for so long..so THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"This won't download on the background, I have to keep my phone on without doing anything else and listen to the song over and over, just because it won't download on the background. Also, it will stop download in the slightest variation of network connectivity... Also, it gets stuck at 91% and I have to start over again.",1
very nice ok Cute chibi,5
Generous gacha Good story Good gameplay Great characters,5
I love the game very much it's just dont like that most of my weapons I've been collecting are all gone and cant be used separately and I miss 4 star weapons,5
"Great game so far, f2p friendly and very generous with the in game currency!",5
"Honestly, it's the best gacha on the play store. Extremely F2P friendly, and something I always find myself coming back to.",5
Um what's with the pink screen? I can't find anything on my game with this bug in the way 😥,1
"Some characters have some pretty disgusting relationships with their younger siblings, including the main character (Euden/[username]), as well as Louise. Furthermore, many of the female characters are oversexualized, including one unfortunate example of the Reluctant Fanservice Girl in Halloween!Elly. Otherwise, I love this game! It's pretty generous for a gacha; the protagonist, while yet another ""Aryan Ideal"", is incredibly wholesome, really does care about his allies, & often his foes too~",2
Its made by nitendo so its good,5
"The best gacha game right now in regards to gacha. No PvP, high rates for the volume of pulls you get, and a healthy mix of solo and co-op content.",5
Absolutely wonderful time!,5
"Great, fun, well-animated.",5
This GAME IS AMAZING!,5
Fun! X3,5
"Been playing since the first event 2 years ago. Great content, very generous to its players, they take player feedback very seriously. Never had a mobile game last me anywhere near this long.",5
Very low expenses game,5
I think twisted wonderland or genshin impact should be a crossover because it would make sense and it would be interesting and they look like they could be easier in a way to do in art wise so please think about it because I think people would be interested and surprised and characters can relate so please at least think about it,2
The game is ok. Dragalia Lost had a major update that addresses most of the problems I had with the game mainly the false information on might requirements. But summoning characters and dragons are still annoying especially when you get more of the same character on a single drop. Game balancing is getting better but character summoning has the the same annoying random drop as any other game that has a gacha gameplay.,3
"The 2nd anniversary addressed a lot of grindiness that initially pushed me away. This is a fun hack-and-slash with enjoyable characters, with skillsets that can be tweaked to your liking. It gets -1 star for being hard on my phone, but in fairness that could just mean it's time for me to upgrade lol. Nintendo has some of the best f2p games around.",4
"Diverse combat and excellent story so far, cool use of dragons and magic and weapons as well as a unique and expansive character roster to use anyway a player likes",5
"One of the best mobage on the market right now! With an extremely responsive dev team, excellent OST, both easy and challenging content for everyone and an intriguing story, Dragalia Lost is one of the best mobage I've ever played. While it takes a bit more practice to get good at since it's an ARPG, you won't regret investing that time. A recent patch even made it such that almost every character (even low-rarity ones!) can be powerful in the right hands!",5
"Possibly one of the most polished gacha games available on mobile. Story, system, gameplay, graphics, music and songs are all top notch. Very free to play friendly too. Highly recommended.",5
Hood game,5
This was Good,5
Game won't start The recent update caused my game to not work anymore yesterday and now im afraid of removing the game and trying to reinstall it Please release a patch to fix it i don't want to delete this game...,1
"I love the game, its really fun and enjoyable, but when I logged on today I lost all my weapons and other things were missing from my account, now im kinda bummed",4
I do not kid when I say the entirety of the mobile games market should take notes from this game. I've spent a year and a half of my life playing this game and I do not regret a single second. There is always something more to do. The summoning is perhaps the most fair system you will ever encounter. Crossovers from legendary franchises are relatively common. The story is really well written and fun. And the dev team listens to the community. Well what are you waiting for? Go download this game!,5
"I wish I could have actually played it! I get to the part in the beginning where I tell Wyndworm my name, do the download while picking my 5Star hero........ And the app crashes, I restart, and I'm back where I see Zethia's face behind that evil lady's mask. It's like having a dinged prong in my FFIII SNES cartridge, and looping back from my last save point... Making me relive sad memories from childhood! Please fix this, I want to play! I beat FFVI PS1 many many years ago... Lolz",1
Love the game but I can't hear the voices when playing the chapters,4
"""Smog Awesome Merchant Merchant Merchant "",Awe love gameplay Wish 100 Blessings upon 200 users... RMC if I can do Lmao...",5
This is the best mobile game I've ever played,5
One of the best gachas I have ever played the amount of fun I had in dragalia was phenomenal and the co op is one of the best it is also the most ftp since a lot of 3 stars are some of the best after they mana spiral.,5
Fun!,5
It is a cool game and it fun,5
Played for about a week until I hit that wall where it stopped being fun and became a chore. Seems like a really great game if you are looking for something to sink loads of time into. Good graphics and game play but I found a lot of the deeper mechanics were poorly explained.,4
"Exceptional in almost every way. This game is somehow a ""generous gacha"", I feel like the game dumps rewards on me for playing. The gameplay and characters, while simple, are quite charming. Also, every character you unlock also unlocks story vignettes about that character (that they give you in game rewards for reading) so you end up with some understanding of who these people are that you pull into your party. Biggest cons: lots of upgrade systems and UI overload lead to confusion initially.",5
This game is brilliant but I do have a massive problem which resulted in me uninstalling this app. The absolutely immense amount of storage needed to run this game! I play every Nintendo mobile game except this one and they're all so brilliant it's so sad that this one is inaccessible on my phone and tablet. My request is that you create a lite version of the download data like you did for fire emblem heroes (an absolutely amazing game by the way). Thank you!,3
Cool,5
Good game but the title screen doesn't respond to taps so I can't play,1
おもしろい！,5
Ive been F2P for a whole year & i gota say i enjoyed this game ALLOT!!! U get rewarded based on how much time and effort you put into the game. that goes for summons aswell. I have never had to load up money for anything in particular cause ur progression will earn u everything over time *aslong as ur patient*. The game is extremely rewarding with summons so if you spend any money just get 7day/30day packs instead that go for about 5$~10$ onece in a while to show ur love & support for the game~,5
"Entirely unusable, completely unacceptable.",1
"Cute characters, a decent universe, and no pushy stuff like a lot of mobile games. I recommend at least a try!",5
Awesome game and great dev team.,5
Good game.,4
Its really good! Storyline seems good so far and the gameplay is smooth.,5
Not for me,2
Failed to connect to server Left room because of error #### Left room because of error #### Left room because of error #### Failed to connect to server,1
"I started disliking some of the controls. 1st I don't like how slow it is to pick back up on movement, after just 1 attack strike not even a combo hits I'm stuck in the animation till it ends then I can move and it feels like I'm lagging hard when I'm trying to avoid attacks. Also whoever said after holding finger for force strike drag in direction you wanna aim but it's wrong I keep Force sticking the opposite way you don't drag YOU HOLD AND AIM THE ARROW AND RELEASE bad intsructins dude very",3
Downloaded game to lg styls 6 and got to the tap to open screen and it wont respond.,3
So far I am enjoying this game no complaints so far,5
Nintendo stops android emulators from connecting to the servers.,1
Nice controls,5
"A lot of love was put into this game and the gacha mechanic are made fair, with high rates and a system that guarentees that you'll get the charater you want after enough tries, plus the gameplay is substantial to form a complete package, i've played this game for a year and i'll gladly spend another one on it",5
Honestly one of the best mobile game I've played,5
Awesome and fun,5
"Aside from the massive download which is around 5 gigs without the voice acting this game is alright. Not really any ads at all, and yes it's plenty of ways to spend money but you don't really have to. This game is super nice when it comes to drawing a 5 star char. I haven't spent any cash and already got like 5 or 6 of them plus you get a free 10 yes I said 10 draws eveyday. So yes I gave it 5 stars, it might get harder down the road but so far super easy.",5
Great game! The controls are very nice and the battle system is pretty cool.,5
If it wernt for the catchy music and fast paced gameplay then I probebly wouldnt be playing this its nice giving a 5 star character to new players but good luck getting anymore that 6% rate is not as friendly as you think it is,4
ranzal and mikoto exist,5
Meh.,4
"Game is fun,many contents to play and many gifts to obtain,control the character a little bit hard",5
Nah,1
"2 Hours In; So Far, So Good",4
Please add an option to put this game in landscape mode and the 5 stars will be yours. I don't like games in portrait mode too much.,3
Good game to play.,5
Its really confusing,5
It's a fun game to play when you wanna pass time! Would reccomend to other friends and family,5
Connection lost error makes game unplayable,2
Its good but it crashes Everytime i want to a do a quest or raid. But the story plays fine for some reason.,2
"So I've barely started playing this game about 2 weeks ago and ill admit it's a very fun gacha game has fun gameplay, co op options, and is very generous with gifts characters and the like . Even letting you pick one 5 star as a newcomer. However it annoys me that with this new update I've recently experienced alot of crashing, and I have a galaxy note 20 ultra. For it to crash alot takes away from my enjoyment of the game aside from when it actually works. Otherwise I highly recommend it.",3
"Easily my top 3 gatcha game with good battle mechanics and graphics. Plus the High dragon trials and Agito test my brain to the limit (which did and I passed successfully). The weapon, wymprints, dragons play a HUGE role in surviving the most brutal of trials. I love this game with my heart. (Plz Xenoblade X Dragalia.... if it does it sky rockets to #1 my entire life.... also complex in a good way)",5
very fun,5
"I loved the game until the newest update. I had worked so hard on having multiple wyrmprints and we Pons just to have the whole game reworked 2 years in. It's really a bummer. The space I got after uninstalling can be used for something else, I guess. Don't redo something that already works.",1
Good game with good graphics and fun.,4
Been playing since launch. Just keeps getting better. Bugs are usually fixed fast and has a constant stream of new content!,5
Takes up way too much memory it first asked to download 400mb which is fine then it asked to download around 2.5gb,2
Fun game I can play this all day long.,5
Amazing,5
2nd time getting into it. Love Nintendo games.,5
Very fun and involved!,5
Awesome!,5
One word......amazing,5
"I knew nothing of this gamr before downloading this app and I now need to go buy a Switch. I don't even know for sure if this is available on that platform, but seeing Nintendo on the label made me try the app. This has been a very enjoyable, TRUE RPG experience thus far.",5
This game is the best but id it me or is the summon for lilla broken because ibgo to summon and then everything breala and u cant click anything and I cant press any of the buttona like upgrade and the home button so i have to exit out and come back in but if i click summon the same thing happens. But still its a 5 star game. :),5
Good game to pass the time,5
"The game looks really good and plays really well. I want to like the game but it's huge. The learning curve can be confusing as small details aren't explained even after the update. Also, there's a wall you hit that you just can't get passed without a good amount of time spent on the game. Not money, but time. You need a solid few hours a week to progress slowly, and I don't have the time for that. I've played off and on and can't get close to endgame modes so it's kinda meh.",4
Awesome,5
I absolutely love it,5
Fun game. Seems well done,5
"i cant even open it. my wifi is fine, everything else is working but the game is saying ""connection failed"".",1
So far so good.,4
"Great game I'm not going to lie. Good story, unique game play, freaking love summons, good characters. Why 4* because I'm salty. I've dl this a couple times(like I said good game) it doesn't save data cause they want you to use Nintendo account. Caved and remade one shouldn't have that issue. But I remain salty I lost all my previous summons, equipment, and characters. Lol",4
Good,5
"This game is really fun (when you exclude having to grind), but recently with the new patch it seems that the game crashes much more often and for increasingly random reasons to...even with the frequent crashing I really enjoy this game and I cant bring myself to rating this game any less than 4 stars.",4
"Change the ""spotlight"" name to ""clickbait"" cause that's what it is. I learned pretty fast that the spotlight characters are actually unobtainable cause they have the same chance rates as any other character and dragon thus labeling the term ""spotlight"" useless. So far all I pulled from those ""spotlight"" banners alot but got fricking dragons and I noticed early on that the probability to obtain dragons were significantly higher than any other characters in general which kinda pisses me off.",1
"This game is really fun! The developers over at Cygames are super generous, making the game very accessible for free to play players. The content the game has to offer is really great too, there's always something to do in the game! I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone who's willing to give it a try.",5
Best mobile game I have ever played 😁,5
Not happy about all the weapons I had getting deleted. You could have changed the crafting system without doing that. Not cool,2
All of the golden stars i summon dont appear on my list 😒,1
Game graphics are nice for phone app.,5
Fun,5
This game takes up an ungodly amount of data to download. This added to its mediocre story and repetitive game modes makes this game seem less like a game and more like a chore to get through.,1
My only complaint is I can't link with my Google account. So if you wasnt to keep your account you have to link with Nintendo.,4
"Great game, would really like to see this on the nintindo switch",5
So I have this game since day one play that I broke my phone had to get a new one and when I link the account to my new one it told me all the data that I had was deleted or was corrupted and I have to start over from the beginning I had damn near all the dragons damn near everything except for maybe a few but I lost everything just because my phone broke I can't even link the account cuz when I link the account it tells me it's corrupted,5
F2p friendly and pretty wholesome community,5
Good game style an awesome storyline,5
The game was great but after 5 minutes you have to up date the game,2
Great little fun game wish it was on the switch,5
Good,5
Fun game 🎮,5
Great game to pass the time,5
Great game.,4
"This game is legit great, and the devs are top tier 5/5, events are plenty and the gameplay is fun as heck",5
Amazing,5
Best game I've ever played on my phone,5
Best game I've ever played,5
"The game has been crashing on me a lot since this 2nd anniversary update, also I still don't have Gala Mym and I'm getting very mad... But I do love this game, great work Nintendo with this idea, I love everything and the concept of it. I'd love to see returning past events through the years and maybe a few other holiday Mym events too to befriend!",5
"Install for 100 mbs, then additional 400+ too play. Pass.",1
The controls are a bit weird. You can move with indicating where you want to move with one finger and stop in order to attack. It's odd. Aside from that it is a nice game. Just have to attempt to get used to the controls. I wish it had a area indicating it would be a joystick of sorts,5
"Great game so far, and seems to have a lot of useful info available to explain the gameplay!",5
"it was an alright game, controls weren't too bad but the first boss battle was like too easy. I know it was only the intro but idk",3
Unlike any other I ever played,5
Very generous game,5
Best game ever,5
Awesome,5
"I cannot possibly convey how amazing this game is. never before have I stuck with a phone game past a month or two. I could go on and on, but theres a limit on characters. trust me, you want to play this game. ***Update: still playing faithfully nearly 2 years later ***update: a new patch has completely, radically altered the way equipment function in this game. At its base, I do not like it. At all. Items are just gone. Support is unsympathetic at best. Players are pissed.",3
"Getting rid of the wyrmprints in summoning was an amazing choice, made me reinstall the game.",1
Best mobile game L,5
Great mobile game but way too many updates. Should of went to the lack luster Switch if you're going to update this much.,1
"Edit for version 2.0.0: Been playing this game since day one and I gotta hand it to the devs, they've improved and added quite a lot. Only complaint I have from the past year of updates is the defensive battle events can be a bit of a drag that usually are used as filler between raid and facility events. The new weapon and wyrmprint overhaul that came with this update will take some getting used to as well. The new models for this update look pretty good, although I hear some don't like them.",5
Great story fun gameplay,5
Incredibly fun and addictive game. Adorable characters too — you will want to summon and collect them all! :),5
It's fun but rerolling for a good dps and a dragon that doesn't suck has made me want to kill myself it's been over 22 hours (edited) and I haven't gotten anything decent,3
the game is new to me and so far the game been great i love the cute music in the background and how well the developeers put time.intothe animation and the features and gaxha and charaters and voice plays i love how the details looks of many playable charecters you can be thank you for making a cool game!,5
"Game always had some issues with performances. With the latest update, it's worse than ever. Game will crash after every single map I run, even when using the lowest settings. Even more demanding apps do not have as many issues as this one, performance-wise. Moto g5+ on android 8.1 Edit : now, I can't even start coop maps anymore. Yeah for losing most of the content. Perfect update !",1
This game was amazing to play and almost always fun. The game can be a bit grindy but its fine because you get skip tickets or can just use energy and have them farm missions while you do something else. This game has a wide variety of characters with unique ablities and their own backstory. This was my favorite game to play for awhile but my phone started overheating and going slower because the amount of space this game takes up. This is great game but I couldnt beaer to see my phone suffer.,5
"Have a decent phone if u want to try this. Action RPG. One-finger controls. Very bright, colorful graphics. You make a party of 4. You control 1 and AI controls the others. I haven't seen a downside as a new player to this game. I'll be back if I feel burned, but going by Reddit posts, this is one of the best f2p games.",5
"The game was amazing for the year i played it. However, they recently did a huge update that DELETED all our weapons that we worked hard to build. It also downgraded all our wyrmprints we had maxed out with augments and unbinding. And they are telling us to now REFORGE our stuff but by using their new system. Not gonna matter to new players, but BE WARNED. You CANNOT trust the game devs. They change things like this on a whim and it undoes all your hard work. I changed my review from 5* to 2*",2
Best game since Bowser's Big Bean Burrito. Great job Nintendo.,5
"A primer 400 mb download to find out you still need to download a minimum of 2.52 gb for minimum requirements, and up to 4.60 gb for high end experience. After all that it still requires a internet connection.......................... 😂🤔😭.......... Bye 👣👣👣👣👣👣👣",2
With the new update they changed the graphics for the worse. Everything is ugly cel-shaded now and it robs all the detail from this game. Also seems to play a lot slower after the update. Thumbs down.,1
"Concern on update. I SOLD a lot of my low tier weapons because of inventory issue, now with the new update, they are useful again. I understand it does not make sense for me to get all of them back, but I would like to ask you to consider making pre-requisites available again. For example, I have maxed out dark agito sword, I should not be able to have that unless I crafted a maxed out chimeratech first. So please register the pre-requisites instead of saying it is not owned.",4
"It seems like it will be a good game. The story line is solid, the characters are interesting, and the designs are. . . . Well formed. But I am new, so time will tell.",4
too big,1
So far so good still new to game so will do indepth review when I have played longer,4
This is great as far as any rpg game I've played on mobile. I can't wait to see how you enhance this game farther with each update,5
"If anyone's wondering whether or not to use all their phone's storage space on this game, do it. It's a free game that rivals even $60 games. If a $60 game of this came out on the Switch I would buy it, no hesitation. The story is amazing, to the point where I'd watch an anime of it. The characters are all really good, with amazing designs and personalities, and the way all they all play into the story is awesome. I'd write more praises, but apparently these reviews have a 500 character limit.",5
"best game from Nintendo and Cygames. It's f2p friendly and drop rates were decent, gameplay is simple yet fun as well, and who wouldn't get LSS with Daoko's soundtracks",5
Cool,5
Great game and really cool grafics but i wish you can put a thumbstick to the game that would be nice and overall you can play mutiplayer its really fun and entertaining awsome game😀,4
I love it because its an amazing and enjoyable game though i do wish i could equip all 5 elements instead of 4,5
It's a really great game guys just getting use to it lol love it tho and love dragons,5
The most recent update wont update properly,1
Amazing updzte,5
Great game combat feels wonderful music is the bomb pretty good.,4
Great graphics and gameplay easy one hand RPG style play with few ads. I've rather enjoyed playing it so far and looking forward to playing more and hopefully Nintendo will continue to produce solid phone games.,4
Amazing game. Personally enjoy it,5
So far it's pretty fun. Large file downloads though. Make sure you've got the storage room for it,5
Impresive,5
"The latest update is awful!!! A good portion of my FULLY UPGRADED WEAPONS HAVE DISAPPEARED! Upgraded wyrmprints reset to zero!F*****G S**T!!!! 2 years I've played this game and you've ruined it, thanks for wasting my time.",1
"The update brought amazing new life into the game. The graphics look amazing, the streamlining of the weapon and print system, and more accessible fights are great. For veterans it may take a while to adjust but overall the game was able to simplify itself without losing it's fun. Easily one of the best games out there, can highly recommend this for anyone trying to play gacha, you won't find one like this. Many complaints of the update can easily be solved by reading, it's not that hard.",5
"WAS a great game, the new update ruined it the graphics look like gamecube spyro before the remaster and with the update the game deleted ALL MY F##ING WEAPONS I SPEND WEEKS ON TP MAKE!!!!! if you join the game after the update thats fine ur starting from ground 1 but if u had it b4 the update u will agree, this game is trash now.",1
ok so i updated the game and it took ALL of my weapons. all of them. very mad,1
Garbage. Too heavy. Forcing me to create a nintendo account.,1
It was fun until after the tutorial. Then I had to delete 2 games and all the cache on my phone and still getting the thing to download was a hassle and I never even got it fully downloaded so never got to play past the tutorial. Makes me want to buy a tablet to play it but even then im sketchy. Games has potential i enjoyed it until then.,3
One of my top favorite games! I love dragons and fantasy and this is right up my alley. The variety of characters/dragons you can collect is enormous and even though the gameplay can be grindy they have an autoplay feature that comes in useful for farming materials needed for the different elements in the game.,5
The game is fin an all but u need 10 gbs to play the full games Like no way,2
"Lord almighty. Whats with the 2nd anniversary update? Character models used to look decent, now they look like blocky trash. PvP system? Really now? Adding PvP to a game that already has people lagging bad enough for simple coop runs? And don't even get me started on the Wyrmprint and Weapons situation. Horrendous. I might not have been the most active but as a day one player its really upsetting to see it go completely down the drain. Uninstalling. There's other, smaller games that do it better",1
Grindy but enjoyable especially with the new update and overhaul.,5
If they don't fix this update just put the game down do to its useless update no one likes it now revert it back to where it was or shut the game down it won't help anyone anymore.,1
Needs work,3
Used to be a 5 star free to play gotcha game. Until the latest update. Lost almost all my gear & progress. Along with the update making progress more complicated. Also got more money hungry. Eldwater has become more important. With summoning being the only good way to get eldwater. Don't download or give this game any of your money. Dragalia just hit their 2nd anniversary & what a way to show thanks to your players. By taking away all thier hard work. Deleting the game now. Hope you will too.,1
This is the best game ever even tho you have to grind it's still the best the best RPG game I would recommend this game share this game with your friends it's worth it thank you for makeing this game :D💟🧡💜💙❤💛💚,5
"Nice game, just started yesterday and it's real easy to get into. The music is probably my favorite part of the game. Other than that well...I'm just gonna have to keep playing. So take this as a mini review haha.",4
Controls are easy enough. I like the art style.,5
Fun. Game that requires no dedication and I can just come back to freely without feeling like I need to invest time. I like that.,4
"Fun gameplay, great characters and cute graphics. RNG for summons are much better now. As for the updated graphics, I'm not liking the black outlines. It doesn't quite suit the rest of the environment. It was better before.",4
Cool graphics and music,5
Latest update deleted all my previously owned weapons and doesn't even refund me the materials i sinked time into. Im incredibly mad at these update,1
"This was a very awesome game emphasis on was, ever since the last update all of the weapons that I worked so hard to obtain from every event are gone all their abilities all the buffs everything. I don't know what crackpot game developer thought that was a good idea but they obviously need to change industries you just lost the fan here.",1
Aight,3
Really displeased with recent update. Lost event and non-event exclusive weapons and standard weapon variants. Progress on weapons reset. Seems like no one had bothered to beta test this sufficiently if at all before deploying this update.,1
Your pvp mode sucks literally the hit registration literally makes no sense someone literally can be in your characters face and it the hit still somehow doesn't land,1
The music and story are dope af. DAOKO rules. Character stories wholesome af. Lotsa bugs but devs are listening and giving out goodies. Love it. Edit: as of 9/25/20 my account tied to my nintendo account is completely gone. Not willing to start fresh. This drops yall to 2 stars. Sorry.,2
"Since the 2nd Anniversary update launched, not only were all my weapons and wyrmprints automatically un-equipped, all of my cool elemental weapons are now completely gone! What the hell!? Who's idea was THAT!? Gimme back my fire sword and my wind axe!",3
"Battle Royale, more like Bad Royale... In all seriousness though, the way stun mechanics, dragon mode trump card, and most importantly the ungodly amount of desync just make this game unfit for any live PvP mode, would've preferred a pseudo-PvP mode similar to how FH: Heroes works where you fight other teams and set a defense team - as it is right now the WORST part of 2nd Anni, which isn't saying much.",5
This is the most wholesome and amazing game ever uwu it's just so good uwu like fr uwu Update: And it still is uwu,5
"Ever since the new update it is THE WORST. All my weapons i worked hard on are gone, even the ones from events! The models are trash, the weapon and wyrmprint system is trash, them kicking you out of your guild is trash, THIS GAME BECAME TRASH. Please return this damn game to before this wack update! I'm never playing again if it stays like this. Who even had the idea this was good?",1
The new models look terrible. This game was so beautiful before. The characters were bright and vibrant and now they look like cell shaded characters that are missing textures. This mock painting styling has pretty much put the last nail in the coffin in this mobile experiment by Nintendo,1
What a grand 2nd anniversary eh?...,1
Been playing this game since Day 1. It is by far the best gacha game in the market...and Ive played many! It gives SO MUCH free currency its easy to get what you want if you play regularly. Devs also LISTEN to feedback and have gone as far as Re-rebalancing because the playerbase wanted more for a fan favorite. Power creep is well handled. They rebalance old characters to be on par (or better) with new ones! Also can we talk about the MUSIC? Go check out the OST on YouTube. Its amazing!,5
"One star, Basically nobody has 7 GB to spare for a gacha game, Thanks nintendo, i am truly dissapointed this time.",1
The new game update is not good. They changed way too much and took away a good weapons I had and the new wrymprint equip system is so hard to use and the now it's based on the weapon is not good.,3
Unfortunately the latest update removed special event weapons and made them only available as cosmetic skins. It also completely butchered the wyrmprint system. Very disappointed by this decision and not sure if I'll continue to play much longer.,1
"As you can tell, most of the recent complaints are coming from the recent update (09/24/2020) after wyrmprints and weapons were ""revamped."" Many players have lost exclusive and essential items that cannot be replaced via the refunds you recieved in mail (example being Marth's Falchion weapon). This game overall is very good and grinding is moderate, but the weapon and wrymprint update ruined the flow many players put their time into. Like a said, a good game with just a not so good update.",3
"Please bring the Mega Man campaign back for everyone that missed it and add more Mega Man characters like Protoman, Wave Man, Dark Man 1 through 4, and so on.",3
"You usually have to rely on external party finders, like discord, to do the endgame content. Public lobbies are a complete mess. There's also no place to learn a fight. You just have to ruin runs for the group until you get the fight down. That's my biggest complaint; everything else is pretty good.",4
"😁Who would've thought Nintendo made a decent mobile game like this one, it's well time developed & precisely fun, no flaws with the touch controls what so ever, it responds accurately & the gameplay does have a lot of charm to it, but just like any mobile game the processing could take about a half an hour but none the less Dragalia Lost is a pretty good game even though Switch is still running the market to this very day.😁✌️",5
"Are you freaking kidding me? All the hard work many of us players put into the game with our weapons and wyrmprints are gone now thanks to your stupid update, turning our event weapons into skins are you serious? Give us back our stuff and the ability to have multiple of the same weapon so it isn't just one of our units who gets a weapon in quests I have no idea who thought this change was a good idea but clearly they were wrong, I'm leaving the game till you fix this, not another penny from me",1
"I've lost my equipment, and don't have enough mats to replace them in the new system. I spe t so much time and effort on my teams and now they've lost so much power. They've added so much more grind to what was already a grind heavy game. My most valuable asset has been taken from me, my time. Yeah. I'm done with it.",1
After the update it took a lot of the gear that I had grinded for away from me which is severely annoying. It even took gear that wasn't event based away.,2
"This has to be the best game you can play for free. The devs are very generous and you can enjoy playing without paying. This game has so much content and the story,characters, and music are just beautiful. The gacha system is great and you can easily get a 5 star. My only complaint is that it takes up a lot of space! This is the reason why I uninstalled it. I can only hope it will come to the switch. I highly recommend this game and believe me, you won't be dissapointed.",5
This game has come a long way from where it started. Much love!,5
The game really great but with the new update when I go in the game it tells me to update so I go here and there's no update option only uninstall and open pls help,5
"In their attempts to modernize? Try something new? Everyone has lost a fair amount of weapons, which now require crafting a 5* weapon and upgrading it to unlock specific non 5* weapons as abilities. If you're someone who plays constantly, then you should have mats to blow; others, like myself, even with refunded mats, do not enough to re-create the weapons we lost. I have teams who have lost a huge chunk of power because of this. I really can't rate it any higher than 1* now.",1
"Love this game, super friendly to non spenders. Excellent art style and awesome characters, the story is pretty cool too, especially when you get around to chapter 13-15. I have played when the game first launched two years ago, but eventually left for a few months because I was into other games at the time. I didn't expect to come back to Dragalia Lost but I'm glad I did, the game is easy to just jump back into it and continue where you left off. Definitely recommend this app ✅",5
"Ruined the game with the latest update, increased the grind and deleted half the work you already put in",1
"It pretty hard to find a nice balance RPGs, so glad Nintendo decided to release on apple/android store can't wait for my switch lite",4
Gives you alot and the game has great potential!,5
"Easily one of the most fun mobile games I've ever played! Responsive controls, cute characters, challenges bosses, co-op is very fun, constant free stuff given out AND consistently updating the game?! What more could you ask for? :3",5
The game has great graphics and awesome music. Everything is really cute. The game is just so happy.,5
"Devs are really on top. Only gripe is the gacha rate. Edit 9.25.2020 I can say that this is one of the most generous gacha out there, now with sparking! I just wish this game was more popular it really deserves it!",5
Engauging story and cool characters,5
There is now a Battle Royale in Dragalia. My Satisfaction is immeasurable and my Day is saved.,5
"I liked the awesome storyline, events, etc., this prog is a monster... its several GB, and often tries to consume all of the space on my device to be my one and only... This last update nerfed all my stuff... seriously contemplating life now... the pros and cons may not be worth continuing...",2
Used to be a 5 star game. New wyrmprint changes make it an infuriating mess.,1
"It's had great times and even better events. If you're asking should I download it? Do it, thiss anniversary is looking like a great time to do it.",5
"HAPPY 2nd ANNIVERSARY DRAGALIA LOST!!!! Overall hasnt changed too much the past year, can't blame them with world events but it is still friendly as ever and they upgraded so many features it feels like it got rereleased.",5
2020 SEP 25 Updating almost mass up the Weapon sys.. Also 3D shader get odd shade on mesh .. Prefer the old ones. Sigh... Good game with poor company and used too much storage spaces.,1
"Has alot to do with easy to understand mechanics, there's plenty of characters, to get with some being extremely unique. My only complaint is that all the elements feel weaker then dark and light.",4
The crafting update ruined the game. My teams' strength plummeted because I lost all my event weapons and didn't get enough resources to replace most them.,2
When is vy coming back,1
Solid game all around,5
Update got rid of all my great gear for combat. Terrible!!,2
I had a lot of awesome weapons and thanks to the update they are all gone. Why would you do that? I work to get those weapons and you took thwm away. Thats shady and BS.,1
My current obsession,5
New update is straight trash. Change for the sake of change. Oh well. That's how mobile games go. You get a couple years out of them before the devs turn them into a dumpster fire.,1
An actual good gatcha game from Nintendo,5
"Not Great, but a pretty neat game ... This have full autoplay with repeat option so its suitable games for thos with busy schedule. It's join work of Nintendo and Cygames, so yea ... iykwim ...",5
This game is amazing would def recommend,5
This game is a lot of fun and very generous with summoning tickets. So if you want a gacha game without spending money I recommend this.,5
THIS IS THE BEST GACHA NO DOUBT I've been here since the release its addictive and fun,5
Great game.,5
It's cygames you already know they're going to treat you right as a players,5
It is an awesome game that's pretty clean and for most ages,5
"This game continuously reinvents itself, progressing time and time again in multiple various ways that continue to stand out against many gacha games. The fact that this game remains so fresh, even under its most traditional principles, greatly impresses me. As a gacha game, it remains quite generous... especially in comparison to its more popular [nintendo] contemporaries. Lastly... this game is, dare I say, fun. There are still problems with this game, but none are particularly game breaking.",5
"Incredibly generous game as is CyGame. Music is top notch with enjoyable gameplay. Majority of the characters can be good and customization is satisfying. If you are looking for a game that is player friendly and won't shutdown anytime soon, this is it!",5
Excellent,5
I love this game. Some great updates have happened since I last played which have made it less grindy.,5
Looks like a great game. But when i try to press start to start the game its says under maintnance. Please fix thanks...,4
"Offers an excellent experience when it comes to Gameplay and Coop. If you are a fan of real-time combat and enjoy playing with friends, its a perfect game to try on mobile devices. Be warned that the game requires a lot of grind; a lot of resources to obtain higher-tiered items that even for people that pay struggle with getting. The Summon mechanic can be a nuisance, but the addition of Mana Spirals brings old characters back to life with enhanced abilities and keep up with the power creep.",4
The game as so much story and lore about it's own world that makes want to keep playing.,5
Dragalia Lost is the best mobile game many have never heard about. The developers listen and the gameplay and story are amazing. The only drawback is that the experience is better with a good alliance that hopefully has a chat system outside the in-game chat. It's definitely worth your time and is ftp friendly.,5
Love it. Very F2P friendly!,5
"Very good game. Pretty complicated, but its fun when you get the hang of it.",4
Best mobile game. Trust me once you get into this game you will at least have something to play while you're waiting for something or play on it during your breaks. Very good game,5
Nice,4
Best gachapon game I've ever played. constant income of premium currency and chances to roll. Great Devs that take community feedback.,5
"Started playing when it initially launched, though i stopped after a bit due to gatcha fatigue, but recently theyve made some very player friendly decisions, and along with consistabt updates it keeps you coming back. You just gotta remember don' get burnt out from overgrinding and a wee bit of bad luck.",5
The best F2P friendly gacha game made by Cygames and funded by Nintendo themselves. The game is so generous with giving players the necessary items and mites(in game currency to summon heroes) that people usually buy the premium currency just to support the Developers.,5
"Easily the best gacha game I've played. My cousin introduced me and I thought I'd get bored and quit, but I'm now farther along than she is. Fun gameplay, challenging bosses, great stories, and super free to play friendly. I have high tier characters without paying a single cent. Definitely worth the time invested. The developers are also super communicative with their played with monthly interviews addressing played feedback. And providing feedback is super easy to do in the game itself.",5
The only gacha I tolerate.,5
Boom,5
I love this game!,5
mobile game,5
Good story and graphics...controls are a little wonky but once you get the hang of it..it's very enjoyable.,4
"Fun game, lots of content, many ways to avoid paying. Unfortunately, there is a massive gap between paid players and free players that makes it hard to compete in finding raid battles sometimes.",4
Why chibis,1
"Great action rpg from Nintendo, so you know its well supported",4
Is it an extremely large game? Yes. Is it absolutely worth it because there's nothing else like it on the Play Store? Yes!,5
Great game,5
"Absolutely love this game. Great story, fun gameplay, and very easy to sink a lot of time into.",5
"EDIT: I still love this game but holy sh*it, it's almost 7 GBs...that's actually insane. How and why lol",5
Cute 😍 😊,5
1 word:AMAZING,5
Bro i love this game the waybits set up and the main character is actually good instead of other games,5
Very fun game love it,5
Nice game,5
"Generous gacha game with *real* co-op gameplay. Although there is lots of stuff to do for casual players, with tons of seasonal rotating events, what sets this gacha game apart from the rest for me is the endgame. Bosses are well-designed and sarisfying to finally beat. The community is great, and the game is way better playing with friends. Devs are amazing, giving out tons of free stuff, as well as genuinely caring about things like player feedback and game balance.",5
Best game i ever played mobile wise....i love the music you very tons of character draws for free and its such a cute game,5
The game just stopped working after the last update the app just closes right before the loading screen. Please help,1
I love this game,1
I love this thing!,5
good one,5
"Sure, the game is good, but it takes up 7gb of space. Most people don't have that much space to spare; therefore I do not think it will do well.",3
"I've had this game for over a year now. Honestly, it's the only phone game that's ever kept my attention that long. The story line is captivating and the game play is amazing. There's always something to do, and another hero to get. 5 Stars! Another amazing game by Nintendo ❤️",5
Best gacha game,5
A bit boring and to big of a file size,2
"So far while playing though, the game is okay.",4
"This is my first gacha game, and it's pretty great. The game just loves to give you free stuff, and there is no PVP, so I feel like I could be on league with the serious players without paying a cent. A couple of complaints though. First, the balancing is kind of all over the place. Second, if you would actually like to buy something to support the game, the prices are absurd. Fantastic game play, terrific soundtrack, and very player friendly. Would definitely recommend.",5
Pretty good so far. I think my one caveat is that the levels are broken down in to such bite size pieces that you don't really get into the groove before the level is over. And currently there's a fire focus summon but nowhere to just do a general non focused summon. Still fun though.,4
Great game but it takes up a ton of space and constant updates,5
Fun gacha with a lot of fun characters and stories! Gameplay is engaging enough to continue to be fun!,5
10/10 👌👌👌👌,5
Easy to play and get back into. Other scammy games like Zgirls and SAO FB barely acknowledge if your account has been removed from their databases even if you've been with them for years.,5
G G G,5
Cool game unfortunately some graphics bugs,4
Warning u will get addicted to the music.,5
"One of the least greedy and most engaging gacha games I've played. For those who know the reference, consider this a white cat project with much better presentation.",5
"Combines game styles of FFBE and grand chase. Both awesome f2p games. Summon rates seem to be pretty low. 6x, 10 summons and not 1, 5 star at all. Yes this is f2p friendly and early game is fun (first 2 weeks) but expect to be frustrated when you don't get anything of quality (alot). This game is not worth spending any $$ on as you will waste your money on summons and not get what you need to progress, but if you just play and grind for a long time, you will eventually get what you need.",4
Nice game!Very high quality graphics also the gameplay.,5
They give you lots of team members in the beginning which is awesome! The controls are very easy and the gameplay is very fun! They also give you free stuff daily and it is a very free to play friendly game😁👍. I would love this game on my Nintendo Switch!,5
"Its a really fun game, but I really want it to decide on if it's a casual game or hard grind game. You can't be both.",4
I've gone through countless mobile games over the years and Dragalia Lost has been the ONLY game that's stayed on my phone. This is a 10/10 mobile game and their collaborations never disappoint.,5
Great burger and I will send you another total number of my personal favorite was thinking of your efforts and do some setting the money at today and do some setting the money at today and do some work tomorrow.,4
"This is an absolutely amazing game. It is f2p friendly, newbie friendly, and the graphics are stunning. Amazing job, honestly Nintendo, you captured the perfect gatcha game with a perfect amount of difficulty.",5
"Fantastic game all around tbh! For free to play it's very fair and you can gain enough gems to pull over and over during times you'd want to! Grind up, pull, get food units and have a blast playing! The combat is snappy and fun, the look is great, and content keeps pouring out! You can tell the devs love this game and it's community.dont get me wrong though it's still a gotcha.. and when goy save you and you don't get what you really want it REALLY SUCKS. But overall Its great ❤️",5
Honestly a gem of an IP from Nintendo. Would love to see a console release. Been playing since launch and it's honestly getting a little convoluted but still immensely fun.,5
You will never regret spending your time (and money) playing this game. The devs are the most receptive and attentive team and actually listens to the players. Been playing since launch and I've seen the changes they made in benefit of the players.,5
Gacha games need to be banned in the US as well,4
"This is by far my favorite ""gacha"" game. The game play is really fun, Its very free to play friendly, and the devs have regularly delivered quality of life improvements. I've gone against my usual rule of not spending money on microtransactions simply because I want to support the devs that made a fun phone game where i didnt HAVE to spend to compete. *Edit* I've been playing this game for nearly two years now. The devs still listen to the players and implement improvements. Still 5*",5
"Quite impressed with how generous and f2p-friendly this is for a gacha game. Gameplay is fun, progression is satisfying, the story is engaging and the music is top tier. Loving it.",5
"Dragalia has grown into a really great mobile action game, and the devs are *really* great at responding to player feedback to improve the experience",5
Fun game. Cute boys. 10/10,5
"Animations are great , and the game gives you lots of ways of building your characters . over all pretty fun .(would be nice to get a holiday euden thats wind elemental and possibly able to use Long Swords/Katanas)",4
Dragalia Lost easily became my favorite mobile game. I just love action RPGs and this one has a cool story and characters.,5
"This game is amazing. It has so much to do for a simple mobile game, I wish it was a full game on the switch or soemthing. It gives you so much of the In game currency that you'll always be able to summon when you want and there are tons are events and cross overs. I love the story and altough it gets a bit convoluted near the end (so far) I think they did a really great job. PLUS the team working on the updates is amazing! They put in alot of hard work. Constant updates and I love the comic.",5
"Pretty great game! And despite the Gacha, I've gotten most of the cast without spending a penny, thanks to how much you can earn the summoning currency easily! Update: Well, I've put a bit of money in since my original post (around $20?) for a couple events to straight-up buy a character I wanted. And worth it if it's a game I enjoy! Still spent less than I did on most games and putting more time into it than them (granted, much of this is essentially AFK, but hey, they've got good stories!).",5
For a gacha game they are much less greedy than the usual games of this style. Love the art of the game and you are allowed to play at your own pace,5
"I've been playing this game for a while and love it. after the last update I'm stuck at the ""touch to play"" screen and it won't let me play for some reason .",5
"Fun, requires a lot of farming though",5
Great game that is generous with it's in-game currencies and listens to it's community. A bit slow with content at times but a unique and fun game to check out every update,4
"fun i enjoy the upbeat music and gameplay! Found this due to the Fire Emblem collab, just got a new phone and can finally play it hope the chance to get those characters comes back around soon!",4
"This is a very fun and enjoyable f2p friendly gacha game. Gameplay and story both are great, artwork is very detailed and beautiful. Gacha rate is pretty decent and the developers/Cygames is really generous so even as a f2p u will get most of the units u want. The game won't get boring since there's always stuff to do with the frequent events and also collab events. We got 3 collab events (Fire Emblem, Megaman, Monster Hunter) so far.",5
Best gacha game,5
I cannot open this game from my pixel 4,1
F2p friendly,5
"The amount of love and care put into the game is amazing. The devs that listen and care, the graphics, the characters, combat, stories, music, events, it's all wonderful.",5
Needs to give more endgame items to players instead of baby materials endgame players don't need anymore,2
"Cute game so far. Controls probably have a trick to them. I suspect larger phones are better. Updates while you're in the bus, not via google store (overnight in a wifi zone for example). No clear way of circumventing updates to play for the few hours your trip takes.",3
One of the greatest games on phone,5
Cool,5
Great game,5
"Love it, the collabs have really pushed me to come back and show how much this game is truly the dominate gacha game I've ever played. Albeit it isnt perfect, but the things it does well, it does it superbly.",5
"When the game lets me actually play like I could before, then I'll consider giving back the 5 star rating. Loved this game, but you didn't want that.",1
"Okada Mym banner when with Bridal Mym, Summer Mym, and Christmas Mym?",1
A very good gacha/rpg. Great story & lots of hero building but not overwhelming.,5
"Daily quest should just say what it is instead of letting me think I'm about to finish just for it to spontaneously add another level to do. ""10000 sanctity, lol jk now 20k"". What's next, you add 40k then 80k then 160k? Just put the required quests on the quest list so I can just not bother trying for it in the first place instead of tricking me into thinking it's manageable.",2
"Best gacha game on the market. Devs have made so many quality of life improvements, and have made the free-to-play model not predatory. Gameplay is super fun, for both active and idle mobile game players. There is no pvp, only co-op, so whales will only help you complete content, and not hurt your gameplay. Unlike most games, you can ""max"" out a unit just by playing the game, no need to pull tones of copies of a unit just to do content. I have found myself playing this game more than AAA games",5
Good,5
pretty good,5
Really fun rpg game.,4
Beautiful graphics and a great story what more can you ask for. Also the soundtracks are awesome.,5
"An amazing little action RPG. Good graphics, lots of free stuff, not P2W, and a well written story as well. The only issue is how large it is.",4
This game was beautiful I just wish there were no errors when connecting to the server.,5
"This is one of the most reasonable gacha games, drop rates are reasonable and limited characters are obtainable. However, I lost my progress when I tried to re-download it, I linked my Nintendo account, but I must've misunderstood how it worked. I ended up linking it to the new save data, if there's a way to get my old progress back, please let me know.",4
Its awesome good game just if you have an Android the game runs a little slow,4
"Amazing game, changes to make the early part more streamlined and the skip function giving summary text made me want to give it another shot.",5
"So fun, the community and game itself. The devs are not only the most gracious, but also listens to user input. Respect to the team as they continue to build and improve an amazing game.",5
"Dragalia Lost is a Fantastic Game, I've been playing it since launch and I've seen the game grow immensely. The game is super fun, F2P friendly, and a very enjoyable experience. The game is colorful with a large variety of Characters that make the game more enjoyable as time goes on. The rates are pretty fair and it dosent take alot to do a multi summon. As a first Gacha game I highly recommend this game.",5
Is good yes,5
This is such a f2p friendly game and very fun to play! Good production value and very fair monotisation by Nintendo. This is a mobile gacha game done right. Kudos Nintendo.,5
Not a fan of the feminist male characters other than that it's okay?,3
it's cute,4
Surprisingly good,5
Amazing,5
Good game but dont like the way downloading works,2
It's fun,5
Very fun if they have a switch game im getting it,5
Fun game so far,5
"Truly a work of art. Wonderful graphics on the title screen. The way the text shows on the screen is very fluid. This certainly is no ordinary, inane product. This is art not even my advanced, 300 IQ vernacular could ever hope to describe, much less match. EDIT: Going back to download this game and I see my old review from day one of the game coming out and everyone was stuck on the title screen. Lol.",5
"Really fun, cant wait to play more.",5
Perfect!,5
"Gameplay is great, music is great, story is great! Best mobile game I've ever played, easily",5
Solid,5
"It's a really great game that just isn't well paced enough to qualify as a mobile game. It spends multiple entire chapters that are just dialogue instead of actual quick pick-up and play gameplay. Great art, compelling story, but I feel like it would've been way better as a console game because it seems to suffer in the mobile game format.",4
"This is the F2P friendliest gacha game I've ever played. I generally will refuse to spend a single penny on games unless it's really worth it, and even I have the majority of the characters. Most events you get 50+ (some events you get closer to 80) pulls worth of in game currency/tickets, without having to put crazy amounts of effort into it. Cygames is also super responsive, and are constantly fixing things, taking into account what the players are saying.",5
They've taken away 120hz support with the last update. Game feels sluggish to play now,1
Love the anime style,5
"I started this game just after launch, and then after a few months put it down, because I wanted to spend less time on it. Now, two years later, I've picked it up and it's better than ever. I love this game so much. Don't think there's another gatcha game I could ever fall in love with like this.",5
It was awesome,5
"Very good mobile game. Takes the good things from other mobile games and leaves the bad with a nice twist to combat as well. Voice acting is good and the story is more interesting than almost 100% of all mobile games. 10/10, would recommend.",5
Cute anime girls,5
very engaging and I love the story,5
One of the best Gachas I've ever played,5
Having an annoying bug where I have restart my device cause I can't load the get as when I tap to start it won't register the tap.,3
"Super friendly for free player by being super generous with currency, lots of cool events and updates, lots of fun characters with cool meta and the music boops! Definitely love playing this game, even taking a break for a year i was able to catch up super fast!",5
Really cute and fun experience,5
Good storyline challenging raids.,5
"Coming from a Granblue Fantasy fan, Dragalia is so much fun, Everything about it is so bright and colorful, The soundtrack is very great, Like Masayoshi Soken Tier Greatness, Its such a great game with how its handled and I love the story so far, Its awesome that Cygames made this and I hope more projects come from Dragalia in the future including collabs, Its neat how there's a few GBF characters you can get as Adventurers and Dragons, Overall I'm really happy to be playing this :)",5
lets just say its good in ways and little bad in ways,5
Enjoy it so far,4
"Overpriced gacha game. It forces too much rotating event participation and prevents progression unless you put console levels of effort into it, or spend way too much money.",2
Fun,5
Best adventure story based game Ever!!,5
Its a rollercoaster of fun fun fun and its story and side quest are challenging but in a good way it makes you want to do better no matter what,5
It's my first time playing the game and it won't load please help 😢😢😀👊,1
If you like anime and manga you'll like the art in this game. Otherwise it's a pretty good game for free use they don't force you to buy which I think is awesome.. your not locked out of many features at all.,5
Good times,5
"Best action rpg gatcha out there that i know of. Not predatory and very generous compared to the norm. Great gameplay, characters and f2p friendly if you play a bit every day and are careful with free summon currency.",5
Latest update locked menus frame rate to 30fps. No reason to gimp higher end devices and give us no other option. At least allow the option to toggle frame rate. Till the fix I'll leave this on 1 star.,1
"Dang, this game is super good for a GACHA game. The music is seriously amazing, download-worthy on its own. Still in the welfare phase but its worth trying to see if you like it. EDIT: 2 months later and still playing. I've got more free stamina/currency than I know what to do with. This game is stupid generous for its genre.",5
"This game is by far the best in terms of rates and the amount of currency given to players for free to summon new characters. The paid currencies are purely just to help people accelerate through content if they choose so. Its very chill n everything is achieveable because the focus of the game is also on coop rather than pvp which creates positive vibes for the game. The music is also VERY good, love it! I was skeptical at first on if i should pick this game up but i have not regretted it!",5
"The game has gotten stale to me :(. Same event gameplay for the last two years... Alternating between facility and raid events.. Most of the game is auto now and the fights you do have to pay attention to are short and you need to grind them a lot, which can get boring. Difficulty in the game has vanished and nothing exciting to play for anymore. They need to add some sort if leaderboard ir competition to spice things up and breath some life back in the game. Or a exploration mode. Something...",1
This is the only mobile f2p game I've played that doesn't play like a typical oppressive f2p game that forces you to use real money to stay current in the game. Love you cygames 😘,5
"Fun game, generous in the gatcha system, and easy to play. A great game to play whenever you're bored.",5
"Great game, lots of free summons at the start to help get you at least two full teams started.",5
"Great game! Although it follows the traditional mobile game formula, Nintendo and CyGames are far more fair about it than other companies.",5
Fun game with lots of love put into it. Cygames cares about its playerbase and is constantly listening to feedback.,4
"Extremely fun, with frequent content updates, and fair about giving out resources for summons. I've spent money once on the game in the year+ I've played.",5
"If I could rate a game with 6 ☆s, this would be the game. I also have a list of what makes this an Amazing Game: 1 They are GENEROUS. 2 The Music. 3 Play Mechanics. 4 Art Style. 5 Adjustments from Feedback. 6 NO ADS. 7 Requires Player's Skill/Knowledge. 8 Always having Updates or Events. 9 Voice Acting for 180+ Characters. 10 Extra Story Content Everywhere. I Love Dragalia Lost. Please give it a shot.",5
Really nice game I like it,5
This is the best dog on mobile. Nintendo make a switch title for this game. Please.,5
"I really great RPG, and the gotcha features aren't demanding in this game. The characters are personable, and story is great, and this is a great family style RPG. Well done Nintendo!",5
This game is actually super fun very unexpected story and game play is amazing only mistake I made is when i downloaded it i chose the highest quality instead of medium sized and my phone can't handle it so its p laggy. Idk how to fix this even after uninstalling and reinstalling so be wary the first time you do it,5
Good game but pls add collabs for summons,5
The game is great but just don't like the fact that when you keep doing the 10x summon. You wont get a garunteed 5 star. And until the fire emblem lost heroes banner comes back. I wont be installing this game ever again.,1
Awesome game,5
Really fun,5
"Returned after 8 months of hiatus and am now able to tackle end game master HDTS and Agito after a month of ""grinding"". The compendium feature for passed missed events are also helpful. Gatcha being gatcha still stings, but I find it more worthwhile to spend orbs for stamina or feathers instead to grind end-game gears and level up facilities further.",5
All good,5
"I've never rated a game on playstore before, but this is one of the best gachas I've ever played. Very f2p. Note however, gameplay is real-time and very action-focused. You can auto most things in the early game but endgame fights require some skill and knowledge. Don't let it deter you though. Do some research, finding a community makes the grind a lot more fun. Production value is also off the charts. Art is great, every bgm is a banger. Easily an S Tier gacha (and severely underrated)",5
Very generous and content filled gacha,5
One of the best and most generous gacha games available.,5
Addiction to its core i love the story line,5
Wonderful 👏,5
"This game is awesome and really entertaining, the only thing is that the rates for 5 star is kinda low. But overall it's a really great game",5
It's fun but sometimes it needs something to break the grind but I always redownload and come back for more... Maybe it's fun maybe I'm brainwashed. Hope fully people find this helpful? Characters are cute and fun and... Hmm Best thing bout the game is the soundtrack for sure!,5
I love this game,5
"Crashes as soon as I reach the main menu, will not proceed further.",1
Played for about 2 hrs so far and the game is quite unique and the hero draw seems to be fairly fair and the graphics are quite unique.,4
"Very unique compared to other gacha games. Feels like a jrpg mixed with gacha elements. Great music too. Probably my favorite part. Last but not least, this game is voice acted. My only complaint, which is minor, there is a lot of menus. It is kind of distracting from the wonderful world they created. Definitely give this a download to try it out.",4
"The soundtrack and gameplay are amazing, the graphics are charming, but the controls can be quite tricky at first but you need to get used to them.",4
"For a mobile gacha, this game is amazing. The gameplay is actually kind of fun, many of the characters are actually well written, the story is actually decent (not amazing, but still good for a gacha), and it's very pretty. It's not too difficult to earn and save lots of the in-game currency, and is more generous than most games I've played in that regard. But it's still a gacha. There is power creep, too difficult content, and chances of not pulling characters you want.",4
Been playing since release (almost 2 years now) and i have to say it's the best mobile game i've played so far with great devs!,5
"Game gets repetitive and boring. When new endgame content gets released, it is so frustrating to try to play with others. Gameplay experience that requires other players to not screw up, is a bad experience. Its either too casual and very frustrating.",2
"The game is fun but some flaws in the gacha system make it close to unplayable after lvl 60 if rng has been unkind to you. Most summoning materials in the game are aquired through 1 time quests so once youve cleared them no free summons. My biggest problem is that you can roll useless duplicates, even during the free 5* summons. Out of 4 free summons i rolled 3 dups despite only owning 2 out of 13 heros in the rotation. Be warned the freebies dry up after 2-3 weeks! Please remove duplicates!!!",3
The best Gatcha for F2P,5
Awsome,5
a good large game,5
It's literally just the best game ever. Period.,5
"Gameplay can be fun, but it's a glorified gambling game. Don't even bother spending money on this game, they give you enough stuff for free as is and no sparking system means you can waste a ton of money on pulls and have nothing to show for it. Paid packs are a complete joke that give you garbage. Game is going to be dead if they don't make changes, it's like they're trying to actively discourage the playerbase from spending any money. It's a shame with how nice the art and everything else is.",1
"Been playing for about 7-8 days and I'm really into it! I've reached chapter 13 of the game, and I like everything About it! From the grind, to the extremely hard and skill-based bosses, to the endless grind! This game is perfect for people who like gacha games and grind hard games! And not to mention you can easily play without spending a penny if you're patient enough.",5
Was once a great game now casualized thanks to the scrubs. We got ridiculously powercreeped while the bosses got easier.,2
Okada ruined the gamd,1
I've been playing the game since it launched and it's slowly been deteriorating some stages just won't load at all even doing everything customer support told me to do it fixed some problems but I still have levels that are unaccessible due to being stuck on a loading screen,3
"Previous SafetyNet updates/issues have soured my opinion of Cygames/Nintendo's mobile games. There are currently no technical issues with the game, but this is due to Google rolling back punitive SafetyNet updates. There is no evidence that Cygames/Nintendo are not still misusing the SafetyNet check as a form of anticheat, an incredibly lazy and hamfisted method of preventing cheaters that also bans legitimate players with unlocked bootloaders. The game in its current state works well, however.",4
Still love this game. The devs are very open to player feedback. And a lot of things have improved and good things added. One thing I think should be tweaked next is the weapon crafting process which right now is needlessly long and tedious especially for higher tier weapons.,5
"I started playing this game late last year and I enjoy playing it daily ever since. But to be honest, I feel like the devs have taken the challenge out of the game to make it more appealing to 'casual' players who find the content too difficult. Might quit the game eventually.",4
I really wish this game could be in the Nintendo Switch. This Game has gave me alot of interest,5
There are a lot of menus and you end up spending a lot of time loading through them. If they were able to condense things it would be a lot better.,3
Downloading is aweful loses connection nonstop,1
"I LOVE portrait mode games. This is a well done game, with little to none monetization. Can be played with one hand. Its takes A lot of space (5+GBs)but it worth it as it feels like a full AAA title!",5
"Amazing game, all around good content with amazing collaboration events.",5
"So far, so good 🤙🏼",5
"At first i was skeptical of this game(spawning specifically, bad history) but its generosity to players isn't bad at all. If you can forgive the grind or end metas GO FOR THE MUSIC AND ARTWORK!!!",5
"One of if not the most complete and more f2p friendly gacha I have played so far, it has good graphics, good soundtrack, lots of content and an endgame loop that encourages learning instead of spending. This game provides a sort of MMO experience thanks to its 4 player boss fights and raids on top of the way you make progress through them. Been playing since day one and I wish more people would give this game an opportunity..",5
Awesome,5
"Gacha drop rate decent, developers active with the community, plenty of freebies and things to do. But, repetitive event mechanics",4
Good game,5
Great game! I'd love a nintendo switch port.,5
Started playing again since it first came out and I gotta say its pretty good!,5
I love this game the music is catchy too!,5
Good game with nice combat and my only problem is with the guilds so over all amazing game,4
"This game is really fun, it feels like a JPRG in ya pocket. Ya grind, ya fight, ya do Co-OP etc. Game has some flaws, such as Shadow power creep, but over all, the game is really fun.",5
"I love it. It's a huge time killer, and it's not like those annoying pay to win games, it's completely free. So fun!",4
Very fun game. Easy to play at home and on the go,4
Awesome game!!,5
This game does not work at all with any of my internet connections please fix.,1
PogChamp game,5
"Easily the best mobile game Nintendo have launched. The gatcha element is far more forgiving than other games, the graphics are incredible, the story and characters are engaging, and best of all, the developers truly care about their players. This game is definitely worth the time you will inevitablely invest in it.",5
I quit after a year and 8 months. The game is the most generous but the end game is horrible for solo players and basically run by elitists. The events are super repetitive with no inspiration. It's slowly becoming less f2p friendly due to larger Gala pool which increases the amount of dupes you get. The direction it's going is basically just not good at all. It feels like the devs gave up after the 1 year anniversary,2
Fun so far...ill keep playing,4
"The presentation alone makes this one of the best games on the app store. Everything from the music, to the character design, to the graphics makes this top-tier among mobile games. Not to mention the gameplay is simple and engaging.",5
Fun game to pass time with,5
"Simple, fun, and allot of side stories to take up your time, when you play it's fun. But realize most of this game is character stories, so if you looking for less reading you might not be interested.",5
It is a really good game and specially if you want a break but it time consuming,4
"I think this game is a lot if fun, hence four stars, however the massive file size is getting on my nerves. The characters are great, the story is engaging, and I love the 'Dragalia Life' comic strips. I just wish I could keep playing, but it's taking up too much space. Just today there was a 1.3 gigabyte update. That's a little ridiculous for a mobile game.",4
Cute game,5
I really enjoy this game it's good,5
This game is good. It has clean graphics. I do not play this game anymore because the events and overall gameplay got very reptitive over the 7 months I played. I would still recomend this to a person who wants to play a good rpg with tie in events from other nintendo franchises.,3
"Best mobile game, period.",5
"Dreamy and fun rpg game to play, but there needs to be the Real Cash Mode where you play it and you get money for free.",5
No ads and no constant pressure to buy things.,5
Fun little time waster but can get grindy after the first few days,3
Game aite but I do be dcing tho.,3
Fun game,5
Not recommended this is one of my favorite games,1
"Love the art, music, characters, and the story too and the draw rate is exceptional to all players to get a good character in the rosters",5
"A must have new free to play game from Nintendo and Cygames, amazing summons and events",5
Awesome! Detailed! Depth of character and design pulls you in for hours. Thanks for the hard work!,5
"Love the graphics and gameplay. If you're patient and only pull during galas, you'll easily get all you need to complete content in the game. Just keep in mind you do NOT need every single adventurer that drops! Focus on one for each element, then build out each team. Gala units are usually always solid, and the other adventurers are variable depending on whether they are a recent release or a mana spiral update. I check GamePress for updates on what to use and the Should You Summon articles.",5
The story is amazing,5
It is googd but there is a lot of loading and no ads,5
"There's probably plenty(?) of people willing to sing it's praises, so I'll do something different. The world building is 3/10 mediocre, you'll feel no investment to characters or events. The default setting of nearly every character interaction is flippant and shallow, like it was made to only accommodate people with the emotional range of a teaspoon. Campaign story is retconned just so MC can legally pork the princess by modern moral standards when the story starts them off as siblings.",3
"The summons will always annoy someone as it is a gacha but the game is really beautiful and the fight is unique,",5
"A game for weebs and weirdo Nintendo fans. Annoying music, every character/class plays the same, and the gacha is uninteresting with subpar rates. The gameplay in general is boring and repetitive. The most you do is dodge red circles. Only took off because Nintendo's name is on it.",1
Good times.,5
"Really fun game, pleasant combat, but I really wish you could change the gender of the MC, being stuck as the prince sucks",5
"Like the cute and adorable character designs, kind off wish this was a console game rather then an app game.",5
I love this game it's awesome but the reason why I rated it three stars is because I don't see how this game is that big. Why do I have to download every once in a while,3
"Simple controls, and a story that's pretty interesting. I'm loving it! I play every single day!",5
"Its a great game, and I've gotten hooked to it.",5
"this game has had its ups and downs, but its absolutely a step ahead of most mobile games.",4
It's really good now,4
Vro it runs well and the soundtrack is a banger like it rival persona 5 in terms of music,5
It won't let me compete chapter 2,2
The game has some good story dialouge and some good game play so far. Not bad as a mobile game i have to say.,5
"Although it starts out a bit slow, after chapter 3 or so it really picks up! It's a perfect balance between gameplay and story, and every event is new and exciting. Oh, and did I mention? There are no throwaway characters! Unlike most games, in DL, every character has a place in the storyline! All in all, I love this game.",5
"Honestly a great game, graphics are beautiful, gameplay is smooth, and the music is to die for. A little nitpick I would say is that this game takes up much more storage that I originally thought, right now it takes up 5 GB if storage, but again it's just a nitpick. Overall, this is just an amazing game.",5
"Game is a hell of a lot of fun! Rates are good, and the devs are extremely generous with free resources. I've thrown them 20 bucks just to support, but you can easily go F2P without any effort. The weapon grind can be a little bit of a drag but the gameplay and character designs are great. Give it a shot!",5
You could pay money but you don't have to the game constantly gives you currency for EVERYTHING very good story mode and the devs constantly update the game and give new stories events and new charecters.,5
such fun yee,5
"I wish I could rate this as a 3.5 instead of a 3, but I still don't believe this game should get a 4. While some of my past issues don't apply, there are several new ones. Haven't enjoyed much if any of the new content, such as the new Agito battles. Now it's getting applied to main story segments. I'm also having far more issues with disconnects, freezing and lag. At this point I'm just here waiting to summon alts for my favorite characters, many of whom seem to be forgotten.",3
This should be 6 stars.,5
"Fun mechanics, great characters, compelling story, and extraordinarily generous developers. The devs working on this game are communicative and listen to the players, they.alone should make this game worth playing",5
"I got hooked for the fun art style, the bopping music, the charming characters and the fun gameplay!",5
Addicted. That is all.,5
"Great game. Surprizingly hard real-time action-RPG boss battles in both solo and multiplayer. The AI in solo/raid battles does well enough. The game is VERY generous giving hundreds of free summons each year, but the cash shop is pretty useless for anyone but whales. Great for free or low spending players. Whales can progress faster than free players, but endgame is heavily skill based, so keep up with the grind and you will get there eventually!",5
gg,5
"It's an F2P Gacha game. That always means frustration and annoyance on the money side and power creep and imbalances among characters. The game design itself, however, is solid, and well worth playing. It's a tight, fun, responsive action RPG.",4
"Gacha game, but it's the most generous Gacha I've ever played... to the point where the stuff you can purchase in-game is kinda worthless. No real gap between Whales and f2p in terms of strength if you know what to invest in. Completely PvE environment so no toxic meta-game to have to worry about. Has fixed some Quality of Life issues from before. Developers seem to listen to feedback and constantly make improvements. Great story in the story mode too!",5
"This ""game"" is the worst thing on here",1
Very free to play game,5
"This is a great game with a compelling story, akd challenging mechanics. The best part is that the developer does listen to olayer feedback and keeps making real improvements.",5
"I love the game as a day one player, but as someone said below you need outside sources to do endgame fights. It's like having a MMO raid but not being able to practice properly with a group. I know some people love this form of endgame content, but it just divides the community further.",2
Great game. Tons of things to do.,5
😢😢😢😠😠😠😭😭😭😭😿😾😾👤💁,1
Cool,5
A network connection error has occurred. Would you like to try again?,2
"Is game, is fun. 5 stars.",5
👍👍👍,5
Controls seem hard to learn but the story has been great and the game looks amazing can't wait to spend more time on it.,4
I'm having trouble loading dungeons of any kind and cannot even participate the event at all pls fix this,2
This game is AMAZING. It's also very friendly for F2P players. Almost no need to pay money unless you want to quickly get a new character/dragon. Tenfold summons are free daily. A tenfold summon guarantees a 4☆ or higher!,4
Love this game love the graphics game play characters and the extra story about the characters and the dragons has alot of depth in it and can tell im gonna be playing this for a long time plus happy enough to get one swimsuit character,5
"it lost EVERYTHING i had even though i linked my account to my Nintendo account! now i don't have any of my event exclusive characters, weapons, or even the in game currency!",1
"Its a great game, the only thing that isnt letting it be a 5 star is the lack of focus on the kingdom building aspect, i would like there to be a better way of getting the things you want in your kingdom, preferably using the bronze coin currency thing, like it was at the start before it ran out of things you could buy. Other then this, the game is exceptional and i would definitely recommend it.",4
A game that shoves the goodies down your throat even if you have enough of something.,5
"Repetitive contents and events, could be fun if you love farming, but feels like the game is not evolving into the right direction. Not sure if no PVP is a good thing.",3
"""A network connection error occured."" This game has several post-install downloads connected to it, all of them are extremely large and the game will not allow you to play it without them. This in itself is not a problem, in most apps people can just put the phone down and do something else while they wait. Not with Dragalia Lost. The game will instead halt itself for no reason with a connection issue message (there is no actual connection issue) and stop until you press ""try again.""",1
Requires way too much space storage...the future updates increases the size as well.,4
Boring,1
Pretty boring.,1
Fun game honestly better than most rpg,5
Crazy that a game with such simple graphics need 4+ GBdata download. Not impressed,1
Phenomenal. This is not a wallet devouring gatcha. Community is respectful aswell as helpful in most cases. Devs listen to feedback and respond monthly to bug fixes. Gameplay is fantastic while controls are fluid.,5
my review is just because dragalia lost wont let me play on any emulator,1
Deep gameplay and generous with in game currency. New updates and events frequently. A great experience.,5
"Really great gacha. Pull rates are fine, events are a little repetitive but gives a lot. TONS of free pulls and 5*",5
Tons of fun to controls are kinda wonky on my note 10 plus I find myself just letting it go in auto alot wish it would rotate and allow me use a joystick and button kinda thing... all in all lots of fun,4
Cool,5
Interesting story and fun gameplay make this game worthwhile. I haven't been playing long but I seems really fun and I get drawn into the story very easily.,5
Great game and love the soundtrack,5
"This game is super fun! I was speculating at first, but I really enjoy the game so far! Although it took forever to get the data downloaded, it was worth it to play the game.",5
Loving the quality of the game and quality of life features!,5
Very F2P friendly. Keep it as my side game. They hand out a ton of F2P gems. Love the art style. I dont really like the chibi though.,5
It is very fun and something I never experienced before,5
"I love how there is comic strips for you to read and the ost of the game is the best one I've heard, plus the story is fantastic! The characters look so amazing even the 3 star units! So when is the anime coming out?",5
"Dragalia Lost is one of many games with such a strong base in world building and lore that really makes me so invested in this game. Characters of mixed personality, silly and serious, a world that makes you want to be a part of it. Gameplay is easy, but enemies get extremely crafty and hard, and makes it all the more fun. What I really like is that your favourite characters can have the opportunity to be as strong as the rarest heroes. Everyone can grow in power and personality.",5
It's a gacha,1
Used to be great but has become increasingly grindy and full of micro transactions.,3
"Completely free to play friendly. For someone who has played games of this genre for years I can say this is the best layed out and most stable one I've ever played. The upgrading process is fun and a grind but doesn't feel pointless either, it's the perfect take on a mobile gacha rpg.",5
50c plz,5
Keep getting server error while trying to download. My phone is downloading everything else fine but this game is being anal. It is def the game not my phone or network because I have tried cellular and wifi and it happens the same.,1
Geme ist gud,4
"Easy to control, easy to understand story, beautiful graphics, and it's got dragons! also it's Nintendo.",5
"Been a great game, but new update makes it so the touch doesnt work in the app. On lg v50.",1
Just started playing it. It's very aesthetically pleasing.,5
"It's a JRPG. Which apparently stands for Just Really Poor Gameplay these days, centering on generic sexualized underaged characters who are too stupid to breed, having a cookie cutter adventure against the forces of darkness that you really start rooting for because the bad guys are at least trying to kill all the stupid people. I didn't get past the first FULL VOLUME SCREAMING ADVERTISEMENT before I decided I really don't care and uninstalled.",1
i mostly like the game works its very detailed i like how the characters look Chibi i also like how the equipment is the game is fun and my Best RPG game ever yet. The only thing i dont like is the little bit of lag it may come out sometime but who knows. i like the game a lot its pretty much related to Brave Frontier but theres pretty much a lot of moving but still my best RPG game ever yet i also like the title to its looks good for me even if the the other games have different font. 4 STARS,5
"SIgh....this game is awesome in all things, with one exception...stamina is ridiculous...i would play this game ALL DAY, and I would put money into this game if ya fix this issue, so 4 star rating till its fixed......",4
"Decent game, often buggy movement. If an event story bugs out, none of the missions work, but events hold important items.",3
rly fun game but I hope u guys add support to Europe so my friends could play and also add notch support to pocophone f1 thank you have a nice day,5
I love this game but when I try to download it on my new phone I get a network error every 5 minutes,4
It's a very nice gacha which is very forgiving to free to play players.,4
It's just another waifu collector trying to pretend to be a dragon collection fighting game. A great game for perverts or people too young to know the difference between cool outfits and sexism.,1
Used up 45k wyrmite for 1 ON FOCUS unit and didn't get him. Gacha is rigged. Won't be returning unless I get that wyrmite refunded.,1
It good game but I keep redownload 3 time to clear chapter 1 it keep not able load,3
"Downloaded because it looked interesting, started downloading the additional whatever it needs, kept getting ""network connection error"" and not downloading, even though I have full service. Did the same thing when connected to wifi, so unless you want to struggle bus your way through that to try it out and possibly not even like it...keep searching",1
Kino,5
"Fun game but not good progression to the end bosses due to time locked progression. The bosses needed to build weapons are on rotation. Sucks to be you if you had something to do, now wait another week. Not enough attack and hp enhancements for both the characters and imprints. You can remove the from characters but, so help you if you forget to put them back on. Character enhancing is a slow slog until events roll around and if you're lucky it will have things you can use.",4
A blast,5
"This game has a lot of positives that has kept me playing since it came out. 1. The game gives a lot of free gacha chances. When you don't get what you want, it compensates pretty well. 2. There are 4 resources in this game. Gold, eldwater, Wyrmite, and Diamantium (paid). Gold is used for everything, and at the start I was always needing more. Eldwater is the compensation for ""failed"" gacha rolls, which is also necessary for upgrading units. This is my most sought after resource as you need a LOT. Wyrmite is the free currency used for gacha rolls. Diamantium is the paid currency for gacha rolls. The resource separation is very good for a gacha game. 3. The story is good and the artwork is good. Many waifu's for all. 4. This game has a lobby system for harder content. You can premake teams and challenge fights together. Recent changes where you can buff up your multiplayer character have been very nice. 5. Even the worst characters can be upgraded to equal, better, or on par with the hardest to get characters. This is NOT a pay to win. Negatives - 1. This game is so grindy you'll spend weeks really not doing anything but burning your stamina and waiting for an event that has something useful. Then something will release and you'll wish you had used your time grinding the other option that you ignored. 2. Ultra hard content takes time to put together and is not for the casual player. 3. There are elitists - you just can't read what they're saying out loud at you.",4
Its a great time. I'm happy with the times I still play today. Abd I hope you have a fun time to.,5
Great game,5
Better than FEH lol,5
Good game designs make me horny Edit: I dont remember writing this,5
Really fun and cute. High quality animations and menus. Good translation.,5
It's amazing,5
I tried to instal the game but it just keeps saying failed to connect to server. I tried reinstalling and it didnt work. I tried i talling on other devices and it still didnt work. My connection isnt bad either and my devices arent old.,4
"This game has a lot of thought put into character design, balancing and story, I personally believe the appdevs have a great idea with their QoL updates and responsive patching. My only problem i've had is the inclusion of double 5*'s with 5* guaranteed pulls, it almost makes paying money a worse idea, i heavily suggest finding a way to reduce the appearance rate of duplicate adventurers",5
"One of my favorite games, actually playable game instead of normal gotcha games where you just click turn based skills. Gotcha isnt too important, lots of free summons and crystals and even some 3 and 4 star are top tier. Takes time to grow lvls and everything no instant growth.",5
Very entertaining.,4
Great Gem of a Game,5
"Super fun, doesnt get too repetitive/grindy until very end game. Any character can be viable (though not meta) with good gear",5
awesome game,5
Best gotcha game ever 👏,5
I've never been interested in playing gaming apps for long since most usually suck after a bit (like feh and animal crossing etc) this game is great though! Very very kind to f2p peeps. Been playing since launch 👌🏼,5
It's another hero collector got'cha summoning game. This one is an action based screen tapping combat rpg. It's published by Nintendo and uses the same puke worthy DS 3D chibi graphics. If you can ignore the chibi animation you'll find the game play mechanics are decent. Moving around the map is sometimes a pain,3
Great game rekt my storage space tho q-q,4
"This game is so much fun. I'm very happy with it. Enjoying the gameplay, the story, and the voices and music make the game great.",5
Initially had some issues connecting to server but the last few days have been much improved. Fun game. Lots of quests side quests and things to upgrade to keep you engaged.,5
A very enjoyable gacha game compared to most.,5
Really slow and laggy.,1
Epic game,5
Cant even play the game im stuck at loading screen,1
"Well I needed an app to be deleted and dragalia lost gave me one, for unexpectedly deleting all of my save data",1
"The game is well paced, give good handouts from time to time, and draws you in when an area with WiFi is around. Word of advice though, this game chews up 5gb and more, so have a phone with high storage and RAM capacities or an emulator so you can handle it. It's worth playing through the story though.",5
Came over for the feh crossover event and now I believe that dragalia lost is better than feh. Lost seems to be much more caring towards its players lol,4
A game that has a chance to make it enjoyable in some way...,5
"Wasnt able to connect to the servers even when my internet was fine, might have been a glitch, sad i wasnt able to play it.",3
excellent art and story. very cute chibi characters,5
I have to uninstall and reinstall just to update the game,1
"This is a great game. It really is addictive and fun to play! The constant flow of events really makes it fun. The story is also more fluid and is constantly being released when able, and the fairness of the game and gacha really do well here. I recommend this game highly.",5
"Well, I'll try my best to give it an honest shake, because I've enjoyed playing it quite a bit. The reason I cut it 2 stars is that gacha is predatory. Spend carefully or not at all, and you can have a good time- It's generous enough that a free player can play and enjoy the whole game. In that respect, it's way better than something like FEH. There's a lot to like here, such as a fun little manga that complements the main story. there's also negatives. Dammit Google I need more room!",3
"Great, well made game. Not perfect, but the only mobile game I can fairly give 5 stars. Even as a casual player, who uninstalls, and comes back months later, I can easily get back in and enjoy the game without spending a dime.",5
super generous gacha game with good gameplay and viable units all around,5
"Wow... Deep for a mobile game, but that might be what I don't like. It is rather complex, takes some time to load at start and some learning all the options. It is the type of game I would enjoy on the switch or my xbox, haven't decided if I'm that bought in to deal with this much on a mobile device. If you are looking for a console quality game, this is it...just make sure you have enough memory to download it... It is huge(5+gigs)",4
Great game to pass the time and loved monster hunter collab event.,4
"I haven't played this game in a while ever since i got my new phone. But when i played it the game it was broken. Scenes were missing, I didnt turn into the windwyrm, I couldnt use my ability, It wont even load and Something was stuck on the screen during the cutscenes, and i couldn't even get through the first part of the game. but other then that it the performance and the graphics are pretty good. It's just there was some major bugs and glitches that would help alot if its fixed.",2
"Love the Graphics and Character designs, as well as the great story and cutscenes.",5
"I was really liking the music, and character designs. gameplay was straightforward, and the stages were short. Upgrading was good until the grind wall crept up on me, and by then i was not really interested in continuing on. Most of the grind for me was leveling the skills and character stars. weapons got really scarce the further i got into the game and the bit of story that exists.",3
Good and just good,5
"Dragalia Lost feels less like a gacha & more like an actual game. Even after taking 2 hiatuses from this game, this game's charm hasn't died out yet. The devs truly take the time to make the user experience more enjoyable, & the in-game microtranscations are purely optional to the gameplay experience. Despite what people say, the story is phenomenal & well-crafted, & the same for the music, which blows me away that it's from a mobile game. Highly recommend this to anyone.",5
It's just a good game,5
It's probably the only mobile game that's kept my attention for more than 2 days. It's a lot of fun and the characters and storyline are all interesting!,5
"Always says ""connection failed"" at the home screen, when my connection is good. Tried on Bluestacks.",1
"Great game however. It's very refreshing, and FE Heroes was just getting on my nerves. I only have one gripe: I'm having issues downloading the game. It continues to stop and I constantly have to retry. I'd appreciate if this was improved.",4
Fun! Great tunes,5
Magnificent,5
Good game,5
"I honestly, love the world of Gaestea in the game. The game reminds me of dragon nest. A mmo I dearly love. More importantly you gotta play this game. It has a really good and indepth story.",5
"Not a big fan of the chibi artstyle, but the game is really well made and the gameplay is super fun.",5
"It's a pretty big game, and there's a lot to do. By which I mean, a lot to grind. The auto-repeat sometimes ends up in a loading loop. The story is awesome, but I find that I'm now only planning to progress to Ch. 9's end. I blame the impending Thanos snap of August 26, 2020. My device will no longer be supported, being an Android phone with only 2GB of RAM. The devs are pretty generous, though. Upon returning from a 2-3 month leave due to device storage, I had quite a few summoning vouchers.",4
Downloading takes forever.... My download speed is 39.16 mb./s.............at least let the download from outside the game.... Otherwise don't wast your time download this shitload of data,1
Very fun,5
"I liked the tutorial so far, but the data i need for thr app is so much since i dont have a very good phone so itll take a long time before i actually get to play the game.",3
Is a fun game that runs well. A few issues but every game has some.,4
So how about a port of this game to the Nintendo Switch please and thank you! Lol great game!,5
Great game to spend time and it can be play easily.,5
"Fun game with catchy Japanese pop music and Diablo style overhead camera. If you like Japanese Anime, RPGs, and dragons this game is for you!",5
Great game. This should be put in the nintendo eshop.,5
I love this game but unlike when it started out it takes up more space than my phone carries and thats really disapointing,4
The game is amazing,5
"In chapter 4, ex1-2, i got gpitched outside map everytime, i cant finish that mission",4
One of the few apps that I genuinely keep up with. Both forgiving and challenging and I appreciate all the hard work.,5
This is the most F2P game you'll ever play. There's constant events going on and revival of previous ones so if you miss any you can catch up at some point.,5
"Game play is fun, optional items are way too expensive to even consider buying",4
"So if you have a rooted device just give up on this game... only game that bans rooted devices from playing it... since when does it matter? Hopefully you change it up, I keep getting ""this device is unauthorized to play the game""",1
This game is good but this game takes up all the space in my internal storage and my phone stops functioning too it is so irritating. Please can you lower down the GB its too high.,2
It gets repetitive pretty quickly and the events all follow the same formula and do not bring any new to the table to spice it up. Other than that the game is fun at some times,4
"In all honesty the only reason I put 3 stars is because the game refuses to load passed the Title Screen. I can't even tap the screen at all, nothing works. And sadly I don't have my game hooked to a Nintendo account yet. So if I'm worried if I uninstall I'll lose everything I've gotten and I really don't want to. This hasn't happened until the recent update, so I'm hoping it will work soon.",3
"One of the few gachas I recommend, it's rng is still brutal, but the game showers you with summons and premium currency.",4
Awesome game great if you love anime or just want a game to chill and play super fun,5
"Best gacha game ever? Nah, best mobile game.",5
i really like the soundtrack,5
"The game is a must have, one of the most generous gachas, and to add to it, it has engaging gameplay and an engaging plot",5
"Amazing Game, enough content to hold you for a long time, great music, characters, interesting story, etc. Definitely deserving of all the praise it gets.",5
"Generous developer, giving lots of gems, but trash rates. Recent Gala Dragalia, Featured rate 2.6% & Normal rate 3.4%. At the end of the day, you still have higher chance to pull normal 5* instead of featured 5*. You better step up!!!",1
Pretty interesting premise. A little complicated to learn out the gate but I think I have it.,4
I downloaded what appears to be just the title screen then have to download the actual game for like 6.5 GB?? Won't download says no internet with full bars on wifi. Waste of time.,1
Any chance you'll do the gala summon banner again?,5
"This game is so addictive, I really love this game 10 out of 10 would recommend",5
Fun game,5
"The game is pretty, but you needed a higher end smartphone to not experience slowdown. Also is a gacha game which wants you to spend money to progress at any reasonable rate or to just get a character you want. I also don't think that the combat sections work that well with touch screen controls. I only tried it because of the art style. If you like the art, you would be better off just downloading it off the internet somewhere.",1
"An amazing game that is way more generous than other gachas. For an original mobile game, the story is really good and the soundtrack is top notch. Good balance of hard and casual content. The only gacha that has kept me coming back regularly since launch. They listen to player feedback quite often and finally increased team slots. Definitely give this game a chance!",5
Great game so far,5
The game unfortunately has become really grindy and power creep on units have become ridiculous. Music is still solid but thr story is horribly written. The most fun are the endgame co op fights but if you do not have a unit that is meta people will not play with you. Even after all this grinding to make your units strong you cant even use them in harder content it is very unfortunate.,3
"Every time I open it, it will say that the device time is not correct and it won't let me play it. Please fix it, it looks like a very interesting game. I will then rate it five stars.",2
"Cute artstyle, great soundtrack and so far I haven't hit any paywall.",5
DAOKO <3,5
Great game and story,5
"Really good music, okay gameplay",4
"GREAT GAME, though I didn't like the reccomend power stufd",5
Update after update I stay impressed. Definitely one of the better gacha games.,5
F2P btw,5
Great game played since day one really listens to its players and puts out lots of updates and content and super F2P friendly.,5
"Amazing game, beautiful and good story line!",5
Great game honestly,5
"This is honestly the best mobile game I have ever played. The gameplay is fun and engaging, team building and developing team synergy is fun, and co-op always introduces a new experience. The story and characters are very fleshed out and it is very beginner friendly and not predatory compared to other gacha games. If you want a phone game that has amazing cast, story, fun gameplay, and team planning, this is it.",5
It's cute and nice. It does auto play which we love. Nice lore.,5
It is awesome Beyond any game,5
I love dragons.,5
The most generous gatcha games i've ever played.,5
Fantastically addicting!,5
Dragons and grinding,5
"One if the best games I've played for mobile, it's a good grind and not p2w",5
Love this game although i recently switched from iphone xr to pixel 4xl and while it does look at lot nicer the performance drops whenever i speed things up. Im taking about from watching a movie to watching a power point presentation. Other than that if i stay away from making things go fast good game,4
Can't install Dragalia Lost. Worked fine one day and suddenly unplayable another.,1
It's a great game. There are plenty of ways to make you're character stronger and the transformation into a dragon was so cool! And the game gives you alot of ways to grind for materials needed to strengthen you're characters. Plus the animation of the characters is smooth.,4
Awesome game! Such a shame I have to use VPN because they don't let it be played in Argentina...,5
It's a good game I just wish I can play it on the Nintendo Switch because of the amount of space it takes on the phone.,4
It's a good game. It takes a while to get rolling if you don't spend money. But ya. A really fun game.,4
I love love love this f2p game!!,5
"The devs are extremely generous with both single pull and ten pull vouchers, as well as the free gacha currency, meaning as long as you dont blow it as soon as you get it, you'll probably be able to save enough to have at least a decent chance for what you want as soon as within the month, compared to the months of others. If you think its P2W you didnt play for very long- You just need to remember to keep upgrading your facilities at the castle as well as working towards the decent weapons.",5
Friends convinced me to play and I am so very glad they did. Adore the story and characters!,5
best music,5
"Best mobile game I have played in a long them, the audio is particularly superb and the story is actually interesting (unlike most).",5
Changed from Monster Hunter into Idle Auto Farmer,1
Really fun game. However got an update got to like 75% and it wont download the rest. Keeps saying Network connection error. My internet is great. Everything but your game works,3
Good gacha,5
Absolutely love this game and how generous it is! On top of that the sound tracks are killer and events are always super fun! I can't say enough good things about it and I highly recommend it,5
"High quality manual dungeon crawler, great English voice acting, one of Nintendos finest games in my eyes",4
A game for 5 year olds. Mindless boring Gacha trash,1
I did take a long break from this and was worried what I'd have to do to return but I was pleasantly surprised! They've adjusted the game with so many QoL updates and even though I am behind this game has ao much going on in terms of catch up mechanics I am starting to feel like i am up to speed again! Editing my rating from a 4 to a 5 now!,5
"good anime game. the story is generic at first but I found myself hooked after a while. it seems like there's always something to do. would definitely be okay with more crossovers, the fe events are always my favorite!",5
"the new player bonus were helpful making it possible to reach a 10k might team. if you were unlucky with free summons. I guess you will reset each week considering how the summon rates /f2p limitation. losing alot of time. however if your happy n reached the 10k, the game becomes slower. the road from 10k to 20k and onwards is stiff. new players will have to depend on coop for awhile, leeching off experience high might players. unless you reach for your wallet and buy into the game.",3
"I wish IO gave more of the silver materials. It feels like those run out much more quickly than the others, even if you trade the gold materials for them. Though, I'm really hoping a sparking mechanic is added. I ended up missing Peony on the FEH collab even after 250+ summons, haha... But overall, great game with nice characters and a decent story.",4
it is amazing I hope that they add more awesome dragons I personally loved the dragons from fairy tail,5
It's the best mobile game in my mind!,5
Good choice with the summoning music,5
A very fun and entertaining game. The rewards are good enough and frequent enough to keep me playing.,5
"I just started playing this game a couple of hours ago, and it's amazing so far. It has a very nice story, generous summon rates, and it's very smooth. I recommend it to anybody reading this.",5
"An actual really fun gacha game, nice work nintendo",5
It's a great game the overall idea and picture is fantastic I think I wouldn't change anything about it seriously it might be 4g but it's more than worth it,5
Keeps exiting to home screen. No error. When i nopen it restartes and crashes?? Again,3
Best Card Rpg EVER!!,5
P good so far,4
You guys should date a live crossover,5
Godly,5
So far so good boys,5
Good,5
I'm liking it.,4
It's an overall addictive game that is constantly being inmprovrfand improved giving players all new things to do,5
Such a good game👁👄👁😆😆🎉🎉🎉,5
This game is incredible! Best mobile game I have seen,5
Ok,5
I like it,5
Fun little time waster. Look forward to wasting much time with this one. :),4
It's ok but the music is too weebish and not that great but besides from that and the annoying fairy its alright,3
Amazing,5
One of the most fun mobile games with cute graphics! I've been playing since day 1 (2018 SEP). Some changes have been for the best but not everything. Decent well-written story with pretty good character development!,4
"Great game, lots of updates and the devs pay attention to feedback from the player base. Likable characters/designs, interesting story, and most end-game content can be cleared with free-to-play resources. Very generous to free-to-play players.",5
Dragalia Lost Best App Game Cooler App,5
"EDIT, they took my money, then when my back was turned, discontinued my only log in method!!! My early access bonuses, app premier bonuses, progress, & paid currency....GONE. Nintendo did this before, TWICE, with MYNINTENDO and CLUBNINTENDO. They say they reserve the right to terminate service at any time for a reason. BC THEY DO IT OVER AND OVER, AND AT THE DROP OF A HAT",2
I like that theres dragons you can collect not just people,5
Okay,5
Unstable loading half the time and the other half it crashes. Not worth the space on my phone or the effort to try and fix.,1
It's great,5
Best.,5
Very generous in giving in game currency as well as actually listening to the fanbase. Gameplay is the best out there imho. Favorite game since its release!,5
Quite the gaming experience on my mobile device. I have greatly enjoyed rolling the summons. GOOD FUN! Actual opinion I just actually roll the free gatch so idk.,4
"Amazing game! I am having a lot of fun, character design is beautiful! I have just one complain sometimes it freezes when loading to start a quest, otherwise it is great, I totally recommend it!",5
"Love the game, just started and love Nadine!",5
一，游戏环境差 偶尔打打挺不错的，不过野队让人肝不起来，肝起来就是浪费心情和时间，建议没人陪就不要妄想找组织，你NB野队照样过，你菜没什么人会理你，理你的也都是找存在感的laji佬。 二，武器，角色，龙强度参差不齐 有些五星角色站在现在的高度和一个三星角色没什么区别，虽然七十环明显已经开始区分星级强度但是同星级去比差距巨大，现在出的新角色完胜老角色。部分角色龙强度与稀有度完全不匹配，这里真的太多要吐槽的了，还有一些标本龙你带了没人陪你组队的那种，每个属性就一两条龙能就业就TM离谱，这一项扣两星三星都不为过。导致这游戏氪金体验超级差差差。 三，活动无趣，后期娱乐性缺乏 因为龙约活动非常乏味，而且重复，难度简单，唯一的变数就是送的东西多不多。所以龙约主打的就是高难本BOSS战，不过BOSS战对角色强度角色种类要求苛刻，同时BOSS战对应武器牵涉属性循环，你这个属性没有对应的相克属性副本很难开，再者玩了一年半了最后只剩肝了，唯一的娱乐靠的是周边四格漫画轻松龙约，精美的立绘和群友YY。 如果你不肝只拿高难本每周奖励（某种程度来说拿高难周常也肝因为没固定队）打造一把满级武器至少要两个多月时间。,2
"Too stingy with the free drops, used to be good",1
"Arguably the best mobile game, but im currently experiencing an issue where I can't hear game audio or even play the game past the title screen",5
"* Unlike any other mobile game. * Cutesy & vibrant graphics. * Upbeat japanese pop background music. * English V/O. * Simple action based gameplay. * Transform into dragons. * Story is compelling, without being lengthy in FMVs. * Each character lovingly designed with 3d model, 2d art, V/O dialogue & huge backstory. Each character feels unique. Don't want to sell or ""unbind"" any of them. * Home screen feels alive. Could spend hours watching him walk past his team mates & get V/O replies.",5
Based,5
Its great and the timing on the cinematics are so much better than before even though I enjoyed it. I like the new update.,5
Best gacha on the market. I love all the characters and they always add new content. I will play this game for as long as I am able. I enjoy it so much,5
Dont play unless u have at least 5GB of space cuz its big real big,4
"First: to much story, not enough play. Second: heros get leveled up to max to easily. Third: you did it right with Fire Emblem Heros. 3 stars because of the battle play.",3
Me taco,4
"I have been playing since March 2019 and I can honestly say that this game has definitely earned my stamp of approval. Quality of life improvements along with the developer's desire in listening to player's feedback all contributes to this little gem in my pocket. As much as being a gacha game in the end, there is still a nice little story to play through, along with a large roster of characters that all have a background story and are not just some generic character for your team. Great work!",5
Very fun very cool Lol,5
Frightening how easy this can seep into your every waking moment.,2
"The story line so far quite interest me, maybe just started not very long. Will comment again if needed.",4
"Enjoyed the hell outta this game, no complaints here!! Whens the next big crossover!? Also to the creators: keep doing what ya doin and stay safe!",5
Cool game,5
"Day one player, so my only issue is for the amount of space this game requires the content amount really doesnt match up. Kinda nothing to do once u reach endgame as u are basically getting weapons that cycle into the same fight (those weapons help u only beat the same fight u are doing to get those weapons). Other than that pretty decent.",4
"It is a great game, but it is hard to get the materials to upgrade/enhance/unbind 5-star Weapons, Dragons, and Wyrmprints without paying money, and to get eldwater. Also, could you please put Phares in Dragalia Lost comics more? And I would like to suggest a crossover event with Epic Seven.",5
"This game is the best and its incredibly fun, i like how the characters are so detailed. i'd say this is a unique game ive seen so far, the gacha is pretty cheap, which makes it more better for old/new player to gain new characters dragons or wyrmprints. Although i do get quite some issues with the game through the past months, the reason i have trouble is lag problems it makes it harder for me to quest or co-op, that's why i need tips from a few developers. Great game and maybe you'll respond.",5
Keeps saying I need a better connection when my connection is perfect.,1
"really fun, but i dunno if my phone's just ass or if it's something else cuz every so often it stops for a sec then i have yo reconnect. other than that, its been real good.",4
Good love the voice acting even though it is limited,4
The best gatcha game ive ever played,5
"Great game overall. Fun combat, good art and music, cool characters. If it weren't for the constant downloads (Wich you can skip if you go to the help section and click batch download), and some confusing UI and menus, it'd be a five star.",4
"For a gacha mobile game, the grind in this game, at least to me, is by far too excessive. This isn't a bad game at all, but this game struggles at making itself stand out with tedious grinding. This is the third time I've installed, and this is the third time I've uninstalled it. Compared to fire emblem heroes, you have to make a hard effort just to make a 5 star adventurer good enough. This game just isn't for me. I don't like my gacha game feeling like a complete chore to enjoy.",3
"Very entertaining, can't wait to experience more!",5
Just started playing. Good game so far.,4
"Like it so far. Cute. Story is basic but otherwise, the gameplay is hella smooth. Will definitely recommend.",5
It's a really fun a neat game Only been playing for a short while but it's really good so far!,5
Love the game so far,5
Nice game,5
Awesome game,5
I have played this game and loved it.,4
So far it's been fun. Classic Nintendo style enjoyment in this one.,5
Pretty great overall,5
"I had the first ever limited time character and played this game for a very long time. I really enjoyed it, until I accidentally uninstalled the game. When I reinstalled it, it said I didn't have a Nintendo account linked to it, despite the fact that it was linked since day one. I lost all love for this game.",1
"Excellent game, you'll need another sd card for it though",5
Bad.,1
"Nice story, generous gatcha, nice gameplay, w lots of events",5
Just started but its been pretty good,4
Very anime. Main heroes voice does not match his model according to a friend. Fairy is very annoying.,4
"Beautiful graphics, wonderful story",5
Good,4
"This is a slick, well-written, and gorgeous game. Low barrier to entry, non-aggressive monetization, generous summon rates and a daily free multi-summon are just some of the features that set this game apart from the competition. The game is very beginner-friendly, and will guide you through its mechanics with an immersive, thoughtfully scripted story with unique lore. Each unit has its own backstory, and you even start with a free 5-star unit. Why are you still reading this? Go play!",5
"fix your broken gatcha system, I'm tired of wasting all my wyrmite on a new character summon, only to get a dozen of the same thing I already had... I used to enjoy this game, but between the broken collection system and the doubling down of the high difficulty curve, it's just not fun anymore...",2
It's a fun game to pass time and a story that seeme to be interesting ar first look.,5
"Great game, great devs.",4
Oh yeah,5
"I am haveing trouble starting the game, when I open it, staying on the title screen and when I tap to start it won't start",5
Super fun!,5
"The music in the game is fantastic. The stories, the heroes, and the dragons all have a way of making you feel included.",5
Great devs and rng,5
ok,5
I'm loving this game its fair for new players and they are very generous with the currencies.,4
After having some bad experiences with previous gacha games this game came as a really pleasant surprise. With a focus on co-op and not PvP creates a much healthier community and the game is rediculously f2p friendly offering tons of free in-game currency to save up for pulls on your favourite character. I feel this game is very underated.,5
It gud,5
This amazing the love gacha games and this my favorite you combined anime with gacha type game and came with something truly extraordinary If i could this be 1000 stars🌟,5
Goat,5
"5-6 gigs of memory !?!? This game is alot of fun and has a great story so far , but it's very complex , and has a weak tutorial. I'll play it another day or two and if I understand what's going on in the game better , I'll raise my rating. Thank you for a fun game.",3
Cool concept being able to turn into a Dragon in real time combat.,4
"It went from being enjoyable and about the players to 100% a gacha that only wants money. You will never pull characters you want due to the mass amount of other characters in the game and ""increased"" pulls/rates from a set do not actually do anything. I recommend steering clear. The game also gets way to easy or way to hard because developers don't know how to balance a thing. You also have a hard time enjoying the story/game when you only get characters you have zero attachments to.",3
Great game,5
Horrible pull rates. Just pulled 300 times on gala leif banner and didnt pull a single rainbow sword. Was playing every day and spending quite a bit of money. Now I feel like uninstalling. If you play just be aware the pull rates are horrible.,1
They fixed the rates,4
Generous and very dun to play. Grind is rough but they even try to make that easy.,5
"This game is amazing and cute. I would really like another monster Hunter event but with different monsters and armor like a kirin that would be even better, but the game overall is great!!! 😁",5
Fun gotcha-style game. Seems well thought out and coded - I've only had to crash once.,5
the devs have abandoned sticking to a good game. insane powercreep resulting in off element character clearing endgame bosses faster than on element. literally no challenge left because apparently new players keep leaving. trying to make the game too easy while discarding its identity.,1
"Great game but since shared skills update, my game is stuck in a loop where it tries to force a tutorial on me telling me to equip some shared skills, but the one it wants me to equip is already equipped. Literally can't play till this is resolved",3
"Generous developer with proven track record (Cygames, not Nintendo), great gacha rate, great UI that keep improving. The gameplay and the art might not be for everyone but if you can get past those, it's one of the best gacha you will ever played. Update 3: for the past two months the trend going to power creep and more monetize route. It's still fairly generous but it's kinda alarming nevertheless.",4
"Best combat in a gacha that I've seen, super clean.",5
Its an amaxing game and the voice actors are amazing.,5
"Pretty solid game. Mym best grill. Also if you just play the game, and don't care about hitting every single 5* on the gacha the. You'll be fine if you like f2p.",5
"Fantastic game. Frequent crashing. Edit: Crashing is fixed with minimal mode. Edit2: After some updates, frequent crashing is back.",3
"Im sorry that there have even been times when I doubted this game. I started played a couple months after it launched. And since then it has grown into an amazingly complex and genuinely fun game. Im not overstating when I say this game is my #1 favorite mobile game, not even top 10 its #1 GG!!! Try it out, get past the campaign so you can play with all of us!!! And a helpful hint for new players, get the Discord app and join Dragalia Lost, to team up with others and ask questions!!!",5
"Are you serious? I am not going to make an account with you. Why cant i just log in with my othwr account like for example. .i dont know. . Like GOOGLE! but its ok cause everytime i want a new 5☆ hero i can just delete the app, re-download and get a better, new hero/dragon. Lol this is fun! I did it 3x already. Didnt like the crappy 5☆ hero. . Delete, re-download🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣",1
"This game has continuously delivered and should be a standard in mobile gatcha game quality. The developers are generous, responsive to user feedback, and have made amazing QoL improvements since its launch. The game is fun and engaging and, while there is grinding, most events are generous and set up to bring new players up to speed. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",5
"As good as any Nintendo RPG you would purchase. Not as high quality as say Final Fantasy, but closer to Legend of Dragoon. Give it a whirl!",5
"I.....cant say anything bad about this game. It is the first true f2p gacha game I have played and I have played A LOT. From the graphics, to the battle system, to the storyline....its all great. Plenty of content and plenty of free stuff. I've only been playing 6 days and I'm already making 5 star elemental weapons and am doing the hardest difficulties. Great job guys. Keep up the good work!",5
"The game is amazing; I have no complaints about the game design, the graphics are superb, the game controls are easy to use, it made me feel like I wanted to play more of it but whenever I syart up the game jt would always freeze on the loading screen for a while. The longest I waited was ten minutes as I got impatient and uninstalled. This problem also occurs on my other phone so its not the phone's problem. That is the only reason that I am giving it a really low score.",2
"Actually entertaining gacha! Fun gameplay and fair summons. Catchy music, too. Heartily recommended.",5
"Fun gameplay. Cute story. Lovely music. Likeable/interesting characters. I got this game for Azazel, but now I'm sticking around because I enjoy it. X3 XD XD",5
Good game very nice grapics and fun to play very balanced game for every one nice game,5
It's a great game to pass the time. Also the story is good.,4
"I love the aesthetic of the game, the characters are so well designed and the voice actors make them come alive! The gameplay is also simple enough for a mobile game but not so simple that it isn't a challenge later on in the missions.",5
Fun game; probably the most generous gacha game I've ever played.,5
It's great at the beginning game. But totally lame in the end game. It is near impossible to beat the Advanced Dragon Trials without forking over a pile of Real Money.,3
"I love nintendo and i love this game, its got a very investing storyline which i like",5
"CyGames does a wonderful job with the genre. The developers are so generous towards the players in abundance. Great writing in similarity to Granblue Fantasy, and engaging gameplay. Been playing since launch and continue to do so. Thank you for this beautiful game!",5
Gud,5
"Ridiculously Grindy, this game doesn't respect your time.",1
"Every update this game has ever had has led to a more positive experience. Cygames and Nintendo are still running a gacha game, but one of the most generous and polished ones in existence. They really seem to listen to feedback and use it to create more positive gameplay experiences every time.",5
"I was hooked immediately, due to the DL's fun and simple gameplay, however the game does indeed have staying power beyond that due to the impressively vast roster of characters, interesting story and an amazingly grand amount of lore. As well as that, out of the handful of gacha games/games with similar elements, it is by far one of the most generous gacha games I have ever played. Worth your time honestly.",5
"A very good gatcha anime rpg, although its a bit laggy, and can cut back on some of the visual features like mana circles, don't get me wrong, its really pretty, just really needlessly complicated and bloats the game.",5
"great game, generous developers",5
"Took one star away for the fact for the most part you need to pay for tomes, not cool",4
I used to play to game a lot and I would still be playing it if it didn't have a ridiculous data size. Honestly even if I cleared everything on my phone I still wouldn't be able to hold it because of the size of file! I would play if came on steam or their own computer game site but otherwise I cannot physically play it because of the ridiculous file size.,4
"Been playing for a few hours, and no pay wall yet... Will update later.",5
Honestly one of the best and most intuitive games I have played on mobile. Crafting teams and grinding materials/weapons is very satisfying. The combat is so good too.,5
"It's a very solid dungeon crawler Gacha with colorful characters and a basic element system. That being said a lot of the more common units have fairly boring, one-dimensional personalities, and with the characters being the focus it is a bit of a problem. The game also wants to have at least 8 units of each element, 4 for each resistance you'll probably need. This becomes an issue because, realistically, you should focus on one unit at a time to upgrade & grinding can be frustrating.",4
"Decent for what it is. Graphics are good, game play is easy enough, just be careful on how fast you go or you'll miss items. Worth it imo",5
"Most generous gatcha out there, layout is never crowded with 10 events playing at once (looking at you, Dokkan Battle) and the graphics are fantastic - and if your phone has a hard time running then there is a option in setting to turn then down to basic. Only one problem! The SIZE. This game will probably hit 6GB of space needed to install by the end of 2020, that's RIDICULOUS for the Mobile Game. Would love a switch port, I wouldn't mind paying 20$ for a game like Dragalia.",5
This game made me spend money for dragon tiddies,5
"UPDATE: New player experience is Slow. But once you need to turn off auto you'll fall in love. I've been playing since day 1 and I can say you don't have to spend a dime to catch up. Tons of currency given. Bad rates. Great Action Gameplay. It's a long grind, but if you like that sort of thing its a top choice. Art is cute and the story is interesting. You'll definitley find something to love here!",5
"In all honesty, this is one of the best gacha games I've ever played. However, as I'm slowly turning into an endgame player. There's a lack of difficult content for the players who've been playing since it's initial launch like I have. Recently, the devs said they'll be adding more difficult content to please the older and new fans. So I give the game a 5 star rating mostly because of the development teams since they actually listen to their playerbase",5
"A good game at its core but has some glaring issues. Biggest one is the gacha. While Cygames is fairly generous with giving out currencies, the gacha rates aren't great and the pity system is just not good enough. Getting duplicate adventurers feels awful as eldwater is pretty common and it breaks your pity rate. Other gachas have improved so this feels archaic. Other than that, I mostly dislike how many loading screens there are and how much battery the game eats up",3
Great story build up and a great soundtrack to accompany it,5
Fun,5
I like to play this game with my boyfriend who lives in a different state.,5
"The best ""gacha"" game. You can spend premium currency to unlock new characters... But this game is designed with a gameplay-first approach and in a way that it is very friendly to free to play and ""dolphin"" players. You will aquire a very large selection of 5 Star units from playing for free for a few months, and most of easily available 4 and 3 star and even free, non-gacha characters are viable for all endgame content. There are top tier 3 stars. And Endgame feels like MMORPG raiding.",5
"Nice story, nice gameplay, nice graphics and character designs but it is a gacha game and it can be quite the grind to get to the point when it's fun again and playing in public room can be very challenging and unfriendly when you make mistakes so I end up heavily relying on guides on YouTube so I don't accidently waste all my resources on the wrong character",5
Great game that gives ample opportunities to pull for charecters. The game play is fun and satisfying,5
Good game to play but toxic people make the game experience horrible need to nerfe the master,3
"Blech. Gigabytes of downloads just to start the game play. Seems like poor programming. And the tutorial was so wordy, it lost my attention. Fail.",1
"I've only just started and I'm already more powerful than most bosses. The game will definitely get harder later on so it's good to grind early. Edit: Its not hard to grind, skip tickets are easy to get and characters are easy to level up",4
This is the best mobile game I have tried so far. The story is so rich and the game design is absolutely beautiful.,5
Great f2p. Story is cute. Art is cute.,5
Awesome,5
i loveeeeee this game,5
"A Nintendo game with dragons and fantasy stuff? What's not to love about that? I love the anime/chibi graphics, and the characters and the storyline are engaging enough to keep me entertained... Only thing is, I wish the game was more turn-based bc I can't work with the controls very well. ^^;",4
THIS GAME IS TOO BIG I JUST GOT THIS PHONE AND ITS EMPTY AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STORAGE!?!?!?!,1
Fun so far only 2 days in though,5
Amazing definitely will hook you,5
The game is great. I should of reEdited this a long time ago. Lets just say you know a good Studio when the devs actually care about their project (the game) while also taking to their player base into consideration when making changes or if change is needed. At the end of the day they are a company that has to make money but they go about it respectfully with their consumer. (Opinion) The only think i personally hate is when games release the same character a bunch of times as a different unit,5
Well made game! Great music and beautiful artwork!,5
Pretty good game,4
It keeps getting better and better. Great job DL team!!,5
"Game is great and fun. However, they start making 1 banner into 2 parts, which cost more wrymites to get the unit you wanted.",4
"The game itself is a decent gacha game and fairly well done. The biggest problem i have had is after i download the app and open it, i immediately have to download 300 mb, alright. I get done with that download and then not even 5 minutes later i have to do a large download (i forget how much but i think it was 1 gb or so), ok cool so then i shouldnt have to download more after this, i think. Wrong. Every couple of missions or so yiu have to download a group of missions, at least they're small.",3
លេងហ្គេមនឹងទៅ!ល្អណាស់!,5
"Haven't gone too far into the game yet, but there is clearly a lot of love put into it by Cygames. Unfortunately the game is incredibly reliant on real time server communication, which means some (myself included) find themselves spending more time waiting in loading screens even for something as simple as menu navigation. I'm willing to overlook that in favour of the game's incredible polish but the issue is still annoying enough to warrant removing a star.",4
Hands down best game ever. Easy to use super fun and always has amazing events going on. Update: Can't believe this game. Absolutely perfect. I got back and received more summons. From normal single summon I got Yurius and Lin You. Love this game best game ever. And the summons are not even rigged or anything. Good job please keep up the good job!! 🥰❤️❤️,5
really good game. super generous with currency and the combat has some level of skill and strategy at later levels,5
"fun at first, addictive, don't play or you'll want to spend money to get the good characters",3
I like the gameplay and characters.,5
"Good game but pls for the love of God, RNGESUS",4
The best,5
"Good game, enjoyable content. Not pay to win.",5
Excellent game 👍 beautiful graphics and easy controls such a good game your missing out if you don't have it! It could definitely be on a console!!,5
I like the mix of gatcha and action.,5
FTP. There is no need to pay other than to support the amazing developers or to get a bit of a boost. The gameplay and storyline are fun and engaging and you can even build your own city. Lots of well designed characters and dragons to choose from. The statistics of the draw system are also very fair. Loving it so far 😊,5
Great game thus far,5
It's fun to play,5
Ok,4
Fun spin on the genre. Edit: i really enjoy the game. been playing since launch and i can gladly say its in no way a pay to win game. came back to rate it a 5 star.,5
"I like this game, but the banners come to quickly and it's grind is long.",4
"I am absolutely blown away. Developers are doing an incredible job, with how this game is being handled. My initial reaction to Dragalia Lost, was how much love and investment consistently goes into this game. It is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen or played. Graphics are incredible, vibrant, and beautiful. ENGLISH VOICE ACTING IS AWESOME. Combat and battling monsters/fiends is easy, fun, and addictive. Stamina isn't much to worry about. I absolutely adore Dragalia Lost so far.",5
"Fun... But can't play it after latest update, game locks up on title screen😩",3
"I actually just started, I will give my initial impressions and continually update my review. The graphics are amazing, the story seems cool.him more complete review after I play more",5
Love this game!,5
"I love it but it's so much space, I literally can't keep playing and it upsets me a bit",4
Literally the best game ever made for phone. The longer you play the higher the reward.,5
Great game. Generous and fun events. Dragalia Foundry has great videos on how to get the most out of it.,5
I'm at a boss and it won't load the storys good andso it the gameplay but won't load I've tried clearing my Cash but to no avail..,3
"It's cute. I haven't gotten very far in it yet, so I don't know what to expect, but it's real cute.",4
Extremely cute game with very good gameplay,5
This game has a fun story.,5
"So far so good. The soundtrack is A+ and the mechanics so far seen promising and engaging. The controls can be a bit finicky, and I wish I could play the game horizontally, but apart from that, I'm enjoying everything else here",4
Grear great game,5
👖🍆🐐,5
Is so much fun!,5
"Amazing game! I love everything about it, cool characters and dragons! Gameplay is very fun and addictive! Play this game everybody!",5
Some challenges require whaling. Most contents do not.,4
Live on forever!,5
"The game is really fun and has been implementing numerous quality of life changes that make it much easier for newer players to get up to speed (chimera tech weapons, hurry hammers, and etc.). Although there are a few characters that may seem like powercreep (mostly the shadow characters), you can clear endgame content with your favorites if you are dedicated enough to get them to work.",5
Fun game so far. Generous compared to other gacha models. Characters seem neat,4
Great graphics,5
Only at Chapter 3 but extremely fun.,4
"Great game, great business model, really listen to the players and respond with quick fixes.",5
"I have been playing for about a week now (sadly missed most of the Fire Emblem event...), And am very much enjoying it! Easy to get into and play, and although the character roster is huge, the ""Stories"" keep each character interesting.",5
I love the graphics and I love all the charaters,5
A full gaming experience for any rpg fan. More than I ever expected.,5
"Cute characters and a fun story. There is a gacha system, sobear it in mind. The controls may be difficult for so.e people but can be learned.",4
"Day 1 player here. When the game released, it was unbelievably beautiful and engaging with a soundtrack that was so good I bought a physical CD for it. However, the game has now spiraled down into insane powercreeps and infinite loops of the same boring thing. If reskinning the events wasn't bad enough, now they just loop old ones. Even if there are new events, there are no new event mechanics or modes. Just. The. Same. Boring. Thing.",3
Fun,5
Very solid.,4
"Great game. My phone abaolutely cannot handle it though, lots of crashes and lagging.",4
"I am having trouble updating the app, I have restarted my phone and can't contact th company who made this game, if anyone can help me send me a message or tell the company to get to work fixing it's app. Again. Now I am running out of space to download the updates even though I clean out all my games and unnecessary data, can some tell me how I can make it so all downloads go to my sd card?",1
"Certain end game things (light/shadow high dragons) are basically impossible to enter. End game material is set up so that you need to have completed one thing to enter another, in a cyclical system... Either you need to find someone to carry you early - or you'll never get it done. Now that people are finished with it, they only play these instances with each other. Getting into it, is basically an impassable wall... Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game. It's a long, long grind. But, doable",3
"Generous gatcha and fun gameplay, add Nintendo into the mix and you have a good game.",5
yeah,5
Great story line,5
Really good app also got good grafics for a phone game it has nice controls and a really good story and gameplay.,5
the game has a guided tutorial where it bugged out and i cant skip and play anymore other wise i would give more stars,5
Great balanced game. I wish there was a better way to organize your stuff though,5
The best game you made for mobile. Just needed a little bit of stabilization,5
great game,4
Bad game.,2
Stupid AI making it diificult to solo on some stages (e.g. high mercury when yr team rush to be killed).,3
Improved dramatically. Only gacha game worth playing.,5
Fair and fun,5
Awesome game,5
"Game had a rocky start, but many quality of life improvements and a generous availability of in-game currency have made this one of the better action rpgs on the store. Considering cygames' business model, expect many updates, collaborations, and giveaways in the future. Character diversity has begun hitting new strides as Cygames tests and releases new character mechanics nearly every update. Unit balance is a bit all over the place, but in a cooperative rpg that's not much of a concern.",5
Yes very nice,5
"Had to edit my review; the game is different in good and bad ways. The good: Endgame is more accessible than ever. With adequate effort, you can clear the toughest fights with random players. They give out TONS of free currency, more than ever. The bad; Power creep and split banners are a thing now. New units are burying old ones. Badly. They do balance old units strength, but its slow and their balance choices are often bad. Also Shadow Element is grossly OP and overcrowded for no reason.",4
Very fair gacha game! You could get some of the weakest characters in the game & make them viable & powerful for even the most difficult of challenges. Recommended for anyone that loves dragons & friendship!,5
Good videos game :),5
Early on this was easily one of the most well made and generous gacha games. The generosity is wearing off and the power creep is getting a bit obvious. Still one of the highest production values in the genre.,4
Very cute and developers listen to the player base.,5
Wonderful game it's not money grabby it's just an enjoyable experience. Good job Nintendo! As always,5
"Game is extremely grindy (classic Cygames) and the gacha is horrible, no way to guarantee a character you want without paying.",1
Pretty decent game has a nice story game is smooth . gave it a 4 cause the drop rate to get good adventurers or dragons are pretty bad other than I'll recomend this game to my friends,4
"I swear this game is just a DAOKO album in disguise. Seriously though, the end game raids are a good challenge and this game has way to much world building (lore/story) on top of the repetitive gameplay. Furthermore, for a gatcha game, the developers are very generous with free rewards and handouts compared to literally any other game to date. If only everything in the cash shop was cheaper...",5
GG Nintendo,5
I try to give it a try but after 5 second I didn't like it I did tutorial but after that I didn't like it sorry to the people that like the game but everyone has there opinion and that's mine sorry again.,1
Probably best action out there. Developers make questionable choices though.,4
"This is the most generous gacha I've ever played, free resources and pulls are constantly being given to players. Also the game is fun, each character has a unique personality and there are many with very unique mechanics. Honestly I wish this was a full triple A franchise, I'd love to see a big game on the switch in the future or something.",5
"I love just playing through the story, the Japanese VAs are amazing. The game needs to be playable on Nintendo Consoles. It'll probably even bring in more money.",4
Great!,5
It's a pretty good game so fars,5
"Cool game, wish it was on the switch tho",4
Leia✌✌✌,5
Good as,5
"Some good ol' anime fun. Everything from the voice acting to the story have been enjoyable. My only gripe is that I can't use my dualshock 4 to play (you can but you have to use the track pad which is just weird). However, that doesn't totally kill the experience. 10/10 would recommend.",5
It was alright would definitely recommend if your into Gacha games but personally i didn't really enjoy the game very much. But your really just have to download the game for yourself to see how it suits u.,4
THIS ITEM ISNT AVAILABLE ON MY COUNTRY!. Devs you should know how hard it is to change my country settings on playstore lmao,5
"Issues i had before from two years ago fixed at some point, so time to update my review~ The art in this game is super cute and i lovr the music. I just wish this game was on the Switch, because I'd actually enjoy the actual gameplay better there where I use a controller. Either way, good game~",5
Good,5
"It has beautiful visuals,smooth gameplay,lots of characters and adventurous story.Really I love this game .But It requires large data files .Still,I rate it 5 for my exp.",5
"Best F2P game out there Great gameplay, Story with a lot of twists and turns, and overall great feeling overall! Would recommend to anyone, expecially a Nintendo fan.",5
"I like this game a lot, cygames is very generous but at the same time they look for money in some cases, and that's the point of a gatcha game, so no hate, but this game is fun, the gameplay is great and the events are super cool in my opinion, but maybe it's just because I am a day 1 player and I've grown to like it, because I've heard it is hard to transition into.",4
its a good game no doubt.. but the amt of battery it consumes... omg.. but very good game... remember to put on charger while playing,5
I wuv Chiki uwu,5
"A Gacha game done right. Developers actually listen to feedback and continually add too and improve the game. Generous with materials and currency needed for summoning. The game is full of fun content that doesn't feel grindy. Give this game a try, you wont regret it.",5
"I came back,hearing about the release of my birth boy,Chrom!The protagonist makes the game difficult to get into. It pains me to say is why I stopped playing.He's no Marth,but he is unexplainably boring.However,the game itself is actually pretty enjoyable,and I got back into it like my favorite pair of shoes. If you haven't downloaded this awesome dungeon crawler,you should..It's a lot of fun. The controls are about the only tuning up DL might need,because it's difficult to target foes/attack.",5
Interesting storylines.. awesome characters.. great graphics!,5
"The game is fun and plays well, and the simple controls make it easy to play on mobile, but be sure to have plenty of space on your phone. The game takes up several GB of space. It's been getting hard to get back into it ever since the Monster Hunter collaboration, the game crashes frequently, namely on transitions between menus, or during the results screen in events. The game's redeeming factor for me is that it's surviving on sheer charm alone, and that charm can only hold for so long.",3
Lots of active content for begginers and veteran players alike. Challenging with new modes and quests every month. Cygames put a lot of heart and soul. Aoundtrack is phenomenal as well.,5
"I never play any games with the volume on but THIS one it's almost impossible not too! A wonderful soundtrack, easy controls, events with popular characters, this game has been entertaining me for hours and I can't wait to get more in depth",5
"Very beautiful and well polished game. Graphics and story are great, and it has voice acting. Honestly this would be my ideal gacha game if only the combat was turn based instead of action. Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of action combat so I only play this game in short bursts, returning for a few days before leaving again. Nintendo, if you ever make another gacha game like this that is turn based, I would be so grateful. Lol",4
"Lots of setting choices, quite a few characters to choose from, but no list of all the possible ones to collect. I had a hard time setting my ""helper"" it's pretty hard to find (top right book icon, then under friends, then helper settings. It would be easier if it could be changed in the character list with a toggle option, or at least a tutorial. I'd rather play as the dragons, they're very cute",4
This is a great game and some of the best events and game play I can possibly think of but I have to give a warning it has some of the worst rates I have ever experienced in any gacha i had 27 single pull tickets nothing i actually used just to increase my rates then used my 15 ten pull tickets in total I got 5 gold units 4 I had already and weren't the featured unit but everything else is amazing and you can turn 3/4 stars into 5 stars so its not a huge deal just don't expect to get everyone,5
"Very fun, lots of cool mechanics.",5
"I really want to love this game. The aesthetic, character design and story are really fantastic, even for a gacha game. What isn't fantastic is the random chance for every update to basically brick my game, keeping me stuck at the ""tap to start"" screen, making me reinstall and redownload the 5+ GIGABITES in updates, destroying my data plan (which I have to share with 4 other people). Coupled with that, is frequent crashes and freezes, leading to app restarts. Furthermore, the ""might suggestion"" is way off, as I struggle to beat a quest with a recommended might of 5,000 with my team with 23,000 might. I'm way to stupid to get weapon progression right, so I'm more or less stuck hoping the combinations I'm doing are working out, which basically leads me to beating my head against the wall. Now, with more positive stuff about the game. Aside from a severe difficulty spike, the gameplay is really simple and fun, with many quests able to be run on auto so you can set it down when you need to grind. Also the game is fairly generous, I've gotten most adventurers and I haven't had to spend a single cent (although at the time of this writing, I still don't have Tiki, one of the only FE collab characters I wanted). Overall, the game is fun, but often gets held back by very frequent glitches, as well as a sudden spike in difficulty that, if it weren't for the art of the characters, I would've easily gotten discouraged and moved onto another gacha game.",3
The game has improved drastically from when I stopped playing. Glad to have given this one another chance.,5
"Lots of fun. Fast paced action. Lots of customization and characters to join your team. Early on, it seems a little on the easy side. Ability to over level party members is easy to do almost right out of the gate. I personally just leveled regularly through the levels to have some challenge. Need a good deal of space to put this on a phone. Over 4 GB by the time you're done with the second download. There is a second option to not download voices, but that still comes in just under 4 GB.",4
"Nice graphics and combat, decent story. The ability to lock on would be nice, but Its not absolutely necessary. Generous reward system, in my experience nice drop rates, pulled four 5 stars in my first hour, I might just be a lucky prick though lol. So far I've enjoyed my experience and hope it stays consistent.",4
Great game,5
Great game over all the story is great and the characters are just amazing from the home screen interaction to just the music there is a lot to offer in this game,5
11/10,5
"Dragalia Lost has great summoning pools, graphics, and story content unlike all other games with gatcha system.",5
It's Amazing the graphics the Models and Nintendo thanks for the Birthday gift,5
"Previously played for a long time on an iPhone 6s well enough but after getting a brand new Samsung galaxy s10e, I get a network authentication error when I open the app and can't enter the game at all. My phone is not rooted, my bootloader has never been unlocked, my wifi is stable and I have plenty of bars. All my research points to this being a safetynet issue on the server side meant to keep out cheaters, but it locks out a LOT of legitimate players as well. Unacceptable.",1
"The gameplay is not really bad, but it also not new to me",4
"Dungeon crawling gotcha game but is generous with what they give away, ,has the option of auto run the dungeons. The combat is action top down style similar to Diablo. You can team up with random or friends, in teams of 4, when soloing you can have up to 3 ai companions from the units you have collected and are able to switch between them freely in combat.",5
"It's Nintendo, so you know the customer service is horrible. Spend hundreds of in game currency on accidentally rushing a building and CS just goes ""We don't refund for user errors"" when the button is literally about five pixels from the Rush Hammers button. I'm also beyond positive that limited banners are rigged in some way. You can't tell me that clearing the previous three banners in single pulls and then dumping 20k wyrmite into the Fire Emblem banner yielding no new units isn't rigged.",1
epic,5
Game runs very slowly on Samsung Galaxy S8. So much that it's unplayable.,2
"The interface is decent and the characters are fun, but nearly everything revolves around multiple layers of gacha systems.",3
Fun on a bun.,5
This game is awesome. I love the animations with the interesting storyline and it is super easy to play.,5
We need more games like this,5
"Playing since start of the game so I know what I'm talking about. I played at least 20 to 30 gachas and this is the one that is still on my phone. I have every limited unit from monster hunter, megaman and fire emblem except one. All from f2p wyrmite aka free gem currency. Game got a lot better after CEO change end of last year and I can only see things going better from here. In my nearly two years of playing I only almost ran out of wyrmite to pull for unit ONCE. That says a lot about the f2p.",5
"Nothing but connection errors, can't even log in.",1
Pretty fun time killer,5
gg. Nintendo still trash no lies.,5
"Fun game, graphics are cute, story is somewhat interesting (maybe get better, idk, Nintendo is already asking for a review and I'm still in chapter 1) ;p",4
"Love this game! Rpg with real time controls and an eventual auto play button. Lots of crossovers such as Mega Man and Fire Emblem and others Im sure. If there was a ""we chillen over here"" option, I'd have to hit that.",5
Cool gameplay!,5
Doesnt work on my galaxy a8,1
Great F2P Gatcha game with good story and animation Just you have to understand how the boss mechanic work in this game And sometime the players in co-op is a bit annoying because your not strong enough,5
"AVOID THIS GAME IT HAS REGRESSED TO A CASH GRAB! They now stagger & split banners, to make the rate up % as low as possible. More frequent limited banners aswell & they are the best in the game for a few months before also getting power crept into this cycle, most permanent summon pool suck. BUT don't worry they are rolling out upgrades that are an enormous time & resource sink so you can turn a bad unit into a mediocre one! Plus we're on our 15th event rerun, new content is rarely added.",1
One of the best if not the best gotcha game ever made bringing a very generous Dev team along with very fun gameplay.,5
This is awesome game,5
Bad civ,1
"As far as an always-online gacha game with super weeb graphics goes, it's pretty decent. The grind for loot starts to get really tedious after a few weeks of progress, unfortunately, but it was fun for much longer than I expected it to be. Definitely worth checking out if you like ARPGs and hero collector games.",3
"been playing since launch day, favorite gatcha by far! love the boss fights! cute art, good music!",5
Probably the nicest gatcha on here,4
"The game won't load at all. After it finishes downloading all the data it doesn't go past some loading screen. I made sure I had space and checked my internet connection but that didn't help. After I tried everything I could, I contacted support and they told me to do literally the same things I did before. The problem was clearly not from my end but ok.",1
"Game let me connect once, looked like it could have been fun. Now, all I get are ""connection not stable"" error messages. I'm in the same room as my router, and it's working very well. Sent from Pixel 2",1
"Awesome game, very f2p friendly. Nough said.",5
"My personal favorite gacha game. Every banner feels very fair and you almost never walk away without the one character you really want, even if you don't spend a lot of money.",5
Love it,5
"First: 6.5GB after all downloads. If you have limited space beware. The devs are trying to pull things around slowly for gameplay. However at the same time theyre giving less free currency and making more currency sinks and power creep. Theyre getting desperate for more money from whales and thats hurting the average player faster than the gameplay improvements are helping them now. Dont recommend starting now, just hopeful they turn it around soon.",1
So far the game is very interesting but I don't like how I bought the starter pack for $25 and didn't get anything so I would be careful with purchasing things.,5
I just love the voice and 3D animation,5
"Great game, except for how huge it is. Doesn't correctly support being run from SD memory, has to hog 6 gigs of internal space.",4
The game is brilliant! I'm not too focused on the story but it's still a great game no matter the story. It seems like a dungeon crawler and I genuinely wasn't expecting that! The music is amazing and the art style is great too but there is a major factor that has pretty much been talked about. Controls. The fighting is ok but running around is horrible with how it's put out. There's no joystick but a line that you put anywhere and it's genuinely annoying. A touch control would be better.,4
Welcome to Dragalia Lost,2
"The only gacha game I've played where I can reliably get every character I want. The characters themselves are not particularly original, but the writing is absolutely superb!",5
Lots of fun and tons of free rewards! Its very F2P friendly!,5
I love the game but it does have some problems like what the new event for the Gullah I spend $340 to try and get Mars did over 30 summons I believe and I got nothing but still a good game it was worth the money,5
"Generous with currency and freebies, fun gameplay and interesting characters. Story is pretty good too. Only downside is it takes a very long time to get to the endgame.",5
amazing,5
Good! Very good! Bunny boys!,5
Simply addicting. I just keep coming back when the events hit. They hand out a modest amount of jemmels for summons too. One of the best if not the best gacha game.,5
I want mym to crush me with that thicc booty. Also needs moar implied lesbian relationships.,5
Great game good updates casual friendly,5
Super fun and very addicting. Constant content updates. Love it! Update from almost a year later: Still having a blast with the game. Play it daily. This is a gacha done right. The crossover events with things like MegaMan and Monster Hunter have been really neat!,5
"Great gacha game! I love the art, the characters, the gameplay, the fact that you can auto play but it's more beneficial to control it yourself, and many other things! Seriously recommend giving this a shot, you will not regret it. Edit: I've played this literally every day. I can't recommend this game enough",5
Very fun but has steep grind after your first 20 levels,5
"Recommed this Game 100%. Soo mamy evebts going on in this game, its amazing. Played since gate was launched.",5
"The most generous and receptive game developers ever. They have implemented tons of changes and improvements the community wanted, all while giving out an enormous amount of free currency for just about everything. Absolutely incredible devs and an extremely fun game, to boot. EDIT: 1 year later and the game just keeps getting better.",5
"The controls are still bad. There is far too much functionality in the game's vector movement system to the point that simple actions such as moving a step forward are hard to do. The targeting system is dodgy and doesn't allow for precise play. The story and characters are bad, very bad. Protagonist Euden suffers from Gary Stu syndrome where the entire world praises the ground he walks on and is incredibly unlikeable. The game has polish and the music is great but there are many glaring issues",2
Great game,5
Awesome,5
Awesome game,5
Has nice graphics and game play,4
"Need to play it more, but so far very F2P friendly",5
They fix it so 5 stars you go,5
This used to be an excellent game but is slowly becoming more and more tiresome. Special events are now split into to parts to ensure maximum cash flow for the developer. As they slowly trickle out the mana spiral for all elements they've oversaturated the game with overpowered dark adventurers. The endgame content is barely manageable even for seasoned players who have been around since day one. Probably best to avoid the game altogether if you didn't start playing it a uear ago.,3
"The game has improved since launch. Pulling a duplicate high grade character is a shame because you only get Eldwater. It's useful, but not at the cost of that summon.",4
Best game....that's it,5
Ge,5
Pretty cool,5
As others have said this game is a very generous F2P Arpg it's worth a download for sure.,5
"Day 1 player here. Over half a year later and this game has done nothing but improve. It has a great and interesting story, amazing and well-written characters, extremely generous summoning rates, and simple l, yet satisfying gameplay that doesn't get very tiring for long thanks to auto-repeat and auto-play. This game will shower you in rewards, and with enough patience & time, you won't even have to spend a penny. This is definitely for all players and I STRONGLY recommend you try this game!",5
"Been a year or so since I started to play this, and honestly while the grinding is slow, it still feels extremely satisfying finishing up a unbinded weapon or building a character you like. Definitely reccomend this, especially now of all times.",5
"Amazing work. Listens to players and implements fixes fast. Gacha rate isn't the best, but all units are useful (my main is a 3* I turned into 4*, with easy to gain currency). Combat and co-op is fun. Most content is easily soloable. It's free, just try it. Edit:Please look into support for samsung dex, it becomes weirdly sized with weird edges, and I'd like to say after all this time theyre still listening! Edit- i have nothing to add, they continue listening to us, so it's still AMAZING",5
This is a great game!,5
Yiiiiiiiiiiiis,5
"Was such a good game; ruined by the powercreep. I stuck around due to Nintendo not ruining this gacha game like all others with that inevitable power creep. Gala Cleo was acceptable. Gala Mars is a joke. It isn't even a creep. It's a power slap to the face where all other fire dragons aren't even remotely comparable, even Sakuya. Somehow, you have managed to take an amazing game and rip it into a million pieces. Bring it back the days of Ieyasu, Gala Sarisse and Lily equality!",1
The game is really fun no broken english and a good story,5
"Fun, but LONG grind, oddball power scaling. One level has most of the sections at 12k might, and then a random 16k might.. Thats a BIG jump in this game. Recently it has started taking forever for the game to transition between end of fight and back to menu.. for several seconds my phone appears to freeze. I have it at the most basic settings, and I'm running an Snapdragon 821 with 4gb ram.. and its this laggy after a reboot. It'd get 4 stars if it werent for that. It'd get five stars if it weren't for some content (that you need to grind to forge certain weapons) isn't available right now..why?!?!?",3
Wooo,5
Needs more pizza,5
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,5
The amount of storage it takes is insane for a mobile game. It's fun but I wish it would take up less storage.,5
it good,5
"Game is great, but after last update I am unable to press anything on it. The screen is unresponsive on the opening screen. I really like this game and hope I don't have to drop it on another device.",1
"people say this game is ""generous."" reality is, other games are just so stingy, they make a fair game like this one seem generous by comparison. this game is as pro-consumer as a gacha game can possibly be!",5
"Its good, but it is 3.4 gigs sooo",5
Amazing game,5
Incredible game. One of the best action rpgs I've every played. It's extremely f2p friendly enough to convince me to help support the game. The devs are terrific with feedback and balancing the game. Awesome experience even when summoning doesn't go your way because the currency is generous enough to where if you don't get one banner you'll get the next! Definetly a must play.,5
Dont waste your time. Garbage summoning system,1
It's pretty good overall.,5
"Fun JRPG. May not give you access to everything at the start, but play more and you should be able to access the fun parts.",5
I never knew that a old Nintendo game could be so good,5
"Not compatible with Android emulators, which is a shame... Would love to play while on my PC! There's a weird audio glitch that has YET to be corrected, where on the home menu if a character is monologuing the screen will transition and cut their voice lines off. A real shame, since a lot of unique character voice lines are only on the home menu. Otherwise, this is easily my favorite gacha game. Does everything a gacha aims to, near perfectly!",5
Amazing game takes up WAY too much storage,3
Just have one word to describe this game n thats AMAZING. It's super f2p friendly they even give a 5 ⭐ summon for free at the start. ❤❤❤,5
Gud,5
So far so good. It is another gotcha game. It can thus be rough if you dont get the units needed or wanted. Though it is not unpayable without paying money which I feel is good. They let me pick a five star for free which is nice since I did not have my account synced so loeseing my data was rough but admittedly my own fault. That said I picked one based on knowing water beats fire and they give you a water base hero a fire based hero and a fire based hero to start. So for the fire area coming.,5
"It's a fun game, not too complicated, and the characters are cool.",5
I really like this game! Just straight up awesome!,5
So fun!!,5
Cute game. Cute story. Continue improvement! Good luck.,5
Best game,5
It's ok fun at first but every two days it's more data I have to download played two to three days ago downloaded the data then came back today and again a download why?,2
It good,5
Dont bother if you want to collect cool characters. Summon rates are absolute bull. Used tens of thousands of wyrmites to summon and not a single 5 star.,1
"Combat is simple but good, art style and graphics are ok and the story seems interesting. So far I'm having a good time, not the best game ever but still enjoyble.",4
Return co-op on alberian front or riot,5
"I came back to this game after a bit of a break. This game has changed dramatically and for the better, since it's launch. This game is very f2p friendly, they give away so much game currency and free summons every event. Every character can be viable, but like all games there is a set of ""preferred "", but missions can still be accomplished with all chars given the right use and combinations. Nintendo has really listened to feedback and has done a great job adjusting.",5
"Amazing gacha game!Really fun and EXTREMELY F2P friendly. Just dont expect to be good without spending time in the game,this goes both for whales and F2P.",5
Amazing!,5
"A fun, enjoyable game, but it's beginning to be a problem from a storage space standpoint. 6.0 GB with the latest version, with the voice pack, is really too large, and they really need to find a way to make the app smaller.",4
Nice presentation. Loving it so far,4
联机模式网络不稳定,5
I love the graphics you did for the dragons and the humans. There perfect!,5
Gg,5
Cute and fun. Somewhat intriguing story.,4
The game is fun and has alot of good qualities. I like the gameplay and the side quests you can go on.,4
I Love It!!,5
Nefaria is super cute,5
"Pretty solid action RPG. Very vibrant, colorful art and great graphics for being a mobile game. The gameplay seems simple at first, but is surprisingly more complex than I thought. Nothing too complex, though. Very fun to improve your team and base. Pretty generic story, but the characters are fun and written decently well. Fun game!",4
One of the best mobile games I've played to date. Love how often freebies are given out. Makes it easy to play without spending a dime. This game is one I don't mind shelling out a few bucks for to show some support so they can keep doing their thing!,5
"Love the game, and story. But cant keep up with the 8g storage sucking it does. I have done everthing I could to keep this game. If you have 32g on your phone I would say this game is better then most gachas.",4
DragliaLost,5
Its a great game amazing 👏,5
"So far so good, really enjoying the combat.",5
Great game. Generous towards free players and events running almost always! Keep up the good work,5
Nice,5
Fun game. Needs better rates,4
"Very fun game from nintendo mobile once again. I have played almost every nintendo game they have on mobile and all of them have been great. Besides the pokemon games, as I cant get masters on my device",4
Its just a super good game higly recommend,5
Class game,5
"It's a great game and a lot of fun, I only uninstall because of the constant connection errors. If you guys fix that I'll definitely play again.",4
Its alright but it gets super repetitive so fast. I keep getting rid of it and coming back to see what's changed but it's always the same. It's just boring,3
This game is great but the storage it requires to play is over 4 gbs I you want to play more please lower the storage in order to play,4
Is ok,5
"Cash grab - units that you can only temporarily summon else never receive them ruin it. They refuse to add these to the pullable units later, so you can never truly get everyone. Save your money.",1
5 times it has had me stop playing to download again. And again. And again. More. And more. And MORE downloading. If I wanted to wait every other time I click something to download the full game then I wouldn't have installed it in the first place.,1
The very definition of free-to-play game. Literally everything can be obtained without having to spend a single dime. In-game currency can be earned just by completing missions. TIME is the only thing you need to invest in this game. Grinding is easy because of the autopilot function. Luck also plays an important part because heroes and dragons are obtained via lottery. Only complaint i have is the controls. But again you need TIME to get used to it. Other than that great game.,5
Stunning.,5
Wow. Seriously deep and complete.,5
Love this game,5
It is a very cool game i think nintendo should make more games like this one because its a interesting game and very fun to play,5
Good.,5
Very good game very f2p friendly and the community is nice it is a grind if you want it to be but you can also just hop in enjoy the story and events as they are very well written deffo reccomend,5
"Very easy, a game that will take time to build up a good team. Graphics are nice and the gameplay is actually unique considering it is Nintendo. I enjoy it.",5
"Amazing. I love the graphics and overall the storyline. Furthermore,even if u already finished the story,there is more quests,raids and continuos activities! If i could rate this as a 10 star,I WILL DO IT!!!Pls,download this game!",5
Good game,5
"Fun game to play, graphics are awesome. Wish they would give us more options for the dragon roost though, like petting or playing with the dragons.",4
The introduction of Agito was great and I feel the difficulty levels are fine. What is not fine is the balancing of adventurers. Shadow adventurers are over saturated and destroyed the progress made with mitigating the Gala Cleo meta problem by introducing Gala Alex and Grace. Don't invalidate the old 70mc adventurers. Keep them balanced or make golden testaments farmable.,1
It is amazing game so much dragons!!! And the little dragons are just so adorable 😍,5
Good,5
Incredibly high quality game,5
Nice,5
"great game, the only few real mobile action rpg out here, recent story update and side story are also very interesting, and they have surprisingly great and addicting music too.",5
Loose gatcha and fun variation on team building.,5
THIS IS GAMBLING. But unlike the other gacha games you can do nearly anything without paying bc they're so generous.,4
Nice,5
"no ads, very fun",5
Trash game.,1
"Good game, Great story line",4
Best mobile game on the store!,5
Love this game. In love with the music and its f2p friendly. My only complaint is every level you gotta fight in has to be downloaded. So it uses alot of space.,4
"Have been playing this since it came out totally free to play and have been able to make good progress in the game without having to spend anything, the games got a pretty good story for a mobile game plus there's lots of content in it to keep you coming back",5
"Fun game, easy controls",5
"I really want to continue enjoying this game, but I got a new phone and everytime I load the game it says *connection failed* nothing will jelp this whether I'm on wifi or 4g data and im disappointed that I can't play the game because it's actually a pretty solid mobile game",1
Awesome game love it so much,5
"I'm not really into freemium games, but this one is actually pretty fun. I'm having a good time playing casually.",5
"Same as other mobile games nowadays. Stupid farming routine, petty reward, nothing innovative in it.",2
"The game is really amazing. The story line is awesome, events too. The characters are really cute and cool backgrounds. And DRAGONS! Really love the generous summon materials giving too. So it's heaven for f2p players. The only problem is that it keep crushing in Raid when I played as host on my phone!!!!!",5
"Crashes often, like after clearing most stages.",2
So far so good,4
"So far it's been good. But the might is broken. Sometimes i'd equip a dragon and see what it does, but sometimes it increases my health and atk but the might decreases by 365.So my team might so it's 8,881 which is shy of 9,000 might. Which also made me unable to complete some co op quests. Fix please. Edit: I think it was fixed? So now time doesn't progress. This has led me unable to get the tailstones which made me unable to upgrade the halidom. :(",1
Fun!,5
"Fun growing game and Kind Developers Played since near the start and I would say this is a pretty friendly game for players outside of some bosses even for a casual like me. The game creators have been pretty open to feedback and the direction of the game so it is like a nice friend excited to show you what they have in store. Story is pretty decent, catchy music, features auto mode to help collect while busy in real life which comes in handy on most areas. Just wish I could play on switch+tv!",5
Play it now,5
"Everything about this game is fantastic except for dealing with this one problem about the touch screen. The upper half of the touch screen is fine but below the point where ever I tap, it appears to think that I tap a little higher than I see.",4
This game is awesome and I love it but it doesnt save where u are when you delete it,2
"The last time I left a bad review, these guys deleted it. That should tell you all you need to know.",1
Pros - Good story - Plenty of choice of characters and upgrades - Easy to pick up Cons - Controls are a little annoying at first,5
After the last update the game won't let me log in. I've been touching the Start Game button for like five minutes and it won't let me start the game.,5
Awesome playing,5
"Rewriting my review, since I've been playing this game nearly every day since launch. I see so many gacha games come and go, but Dragalia has stayed consistent in its presentation and quality. New characters and features regularly, powercreep is kept as low as possible, and thanks to mana spirals, some old 3 star units are better than 5 star ones you can pull today. Graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay are all great. Just stay clear of standard gacha game pitfalls and you'll have a good time.",5
"Excellent quality and plenty of content from the generous developers, only main issue is the large file size due to multiple updates, but otherwise a fun experience overall.",5
April Fool's day event! One day only! *patch repeatedly fails to download* ..nice joke? >_>,2
solid,5
So much fun. Enjoy the story,5
"One of the best mobile games to date, best gameplay and combat experience off PC or console. If you're a fan of RPG games this is a game for you",5
Awesome,5
"The game has been alright overall, but there are two main issues with it. First is that the game is a little too grindy in my opion, and that I've recantly struggled to update the game, which is necassary to continue playing. Other than those two things the game is quite good, ecspally for a mobile game.",4
"I quite like the actually gameplay, the story is fine, the characters are cool, it'd be getting a higher score if not for the constant crashing. On my Moto G5+ it's completely unplayable no matter the graphics settings (even after factory reset), the UI is insanely laggy, unresponsive, and freezes/crashes after almost every fight. Cannot recommend in its current state.",1
Make a wallpaper of this,5
"It's a really good game upfront, but the lack of end game and solo player quality of life is way too apparent to make the game any fun for solo players at end game.",3
best game I have ever played have had it for a couple months and is still surprised by it.,5
"Always updating and evolving to give quality of life features. Posting new story steps frequently. Enhanced pull rates for rares when you haven't gotten a five star in a while. No need to buy premium currency. Beautiful art for in game items that CREDITS THE INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS so you can later find them elsewhere. Event quality keeps going up, and now has replayable seasonal events so newcomers don't miss out and have to wait a whole year to play. ...I'm all out of letters! Good good game.",5
It fun,4
Soooo glad they fixed the game it's one of my favorite games. Kinda reminds me of white cat project.,5
"Wonderful story, beautiful consistent art, the music is very enchanting, the movement controls are a bit hard for me but they are nice in battle and pretty simple. Everything is great!",5
"I didnt roll any 5 stars, this is the final nail in the coffin. Everyone has Cleo and I cant even clear mercurial on easy. This game is not good and I recommend to play some other game because Nintendo milked me out of money. Corrupt business >:(",1
"Been playing this game for over a year and a half now, I have truly enjoyed it a lot. A nice story and each character is pretty interesting despite there being so many. Yes it has the common stuff that many gacha games have, but it is still a fun game to play.",4
More fun than I thought it would be. Unique controls as far as a mobile game goes. Very similar feel to World bosses in MMOs. It is a captcha game which is a little annoying but there's so much in-game currency given away that it isn't a very noticeable hindrance in most cases.,5
"I played gbf before playing dragalia lost, and thank you cygames for being very generous with gifts and listen to your players as always.",5
I love playing is games with my family and friends,5
Fun generous game,5
Best game I have ever played in my life.,5
One of the best mobile games I have ever played,5
"A mobile fantasy gacha RPG that hits all the right notes -- an attractive art style, gameplay that is fast-paced and intuitive, and a beautiful soundtrack. Its ongoing story manages to engross players, and the simple gameplay belies the strategy employed in effective unit/team building. The game is generous with both its currency and pull rates, and the developers are consistently producing new content and addressing existing issues. Dragalia Lost impresses as an outstanding title in its genre.",5
Fun and cute game,5
I really like this game but the constant updates every time I open it up is driving me nuts. Why not consider making it for the PC or a gaming system? I mean everyone knows phones have only but so much space. SD cards aren't that reliable and it's inconvenient. Eventually I may have to drop this game due to the space eating.,4
"After hours of extensive review, the controls of the maintenance screen worked flawlessly, the crisp attention to detail is mind blowing. This...this is the quintessence of mobile ARPG. 03/2020 edit You can murder dragons that govern life, death, space, and time with a sentient onion that desires to be eaten. GOTY 2020",5
Amazing and free to play friendly,5
"The most generous game for F2P players, bar absolutely none.",5
The game has improved dramatically over the years and deserves praise for what they've achieved. I left for roughly 3 months and came back only to see that they've improved on their format. I am gaming on a razer phone so my experience is 120 fps and very smooth. This may vary to people but the controls are super easy. One hand is enough. The game's three star characters are still considered top tier. It all depends on how you build it. Super generous with the currency.,5
Good game keeps crashing,5
Enjoyable experience.,5
Nice,5
"The changes in this game's progression was improved and got me to give it another shot some time ago. The gacha can still be quite expensive but a lot less worse than other games. The grind also improved but best to check out a map to know what to craft first, etc. The dev team is generous too handing out occasional wyrmite and this might be the best mobile action game I've played in a long time and hopefully more years to come.",5
Absolutely great game! It is another Gacha game BUT the game is super generous with it and the game doesnt require you to pay to be great at it like other gacha games... give it a shot!,5
"Ver awesome game. Very f2p friendly. Played the game at launched but stopped because of potato phone lol. Came back 2 weeks ago to a lot of freebies and in time for the gala summons. A lot of characters got some buffs with the Mana spiral introduction. Overall I'm enjoying it. Been able to go into some of the higher content very easy now, some not all of it hahaha looking forward to the higher end game stuff 😁",5
"Best gameplay of any mobage I've played (FGO JP day 1/EN, GFL EN Day 1, AL EN CBT). Not as lewd as other mobage but plays like an MMO at times with raids and such. Try out the game for a few minutes if you're looking for a better mobage. You'll be blown away like I was.",5
"Fun gatcha game with ARPG and MMO elements. Very generous to free players, but paid packs are overpriced after the first $7 intro pack.",5
Amazing game! Most fair gacha game out there,5
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,5
"Too many updates, a new update every morning Won't run on WiFi, I must switch to data to use Asks me to rate the game too much",1
Just started. Seems there is a ton of things to do.,4
Very Fun.,5
"Nice fun game, already have plenty of charecters I enjoy. Keep it going~",5
Fun game Generous devs Hardcore mmo disguised as a mobile game,5
Awesome game it's a little on the chunky side in terms of memory but I think it's worth it nice storyline as well 👌🏻👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5
Game needs 5gbs of free space.,4
Getting a gala is really hard,5
fun game,5
Been addicted to this game since it came out it has a great story and characters the voice acting is done extremely well.,5
ok,4
It won't open after download. Been like this for months,1
Awsome game and character are really cool,5
"pretty decent gameplay, good voice acting but the gacha rates are iffy, plus three different things to roll for is rough EDIT: WYRMPRINTS REMOVED, much better rates with only two things to roll for",4
Doesnt start,1
"Controls take some getting use to but overall a good take on gatcha games, breaks away from the normal turn based strategy.",5
Excellent gameplay!,5
"2020 review To all newcomers in 2020 if you reach end game, try join a discord channel to clear the content as most pubs are toxic in terms of requirements. At this time of posting try summon the character Gala Alex.",3
Pog,5
Hey Nintendo it won't let me play because it says something about a. Network or wifi and my wifi is on and its connected to my phone but it won't play me play. But besides that I hope you fix it and I like the game and the music is great!,5
no pvp = doo doo,3
Dragalia is a good game at its core but is held back by greedy over priced microtransactions. The currency needed to summon new heros is scarce and there is no option to purchase the heros you want individually. You can buy the premium currency to perform a single summon or a ten hero or ( ten fold summon) that averages about $24 for a chance to summon a 5* hero in a overcrowded hero pool.,3
"Good RPG, decent story, fun gameplay.",4
"Pretty good overall experience, but some high level raids are kinda cancer",4
"After the girthy download due to needing to play offline, I really enjoy this and it will help keep me busy during those 3rd shifts of being essential security.",4
"I only downloaded this game because of Daoko, I stanned her for a very long time so I decided to give this game a go when she released songs for this game. Before I knew it, I was sucked into the game play, it's really addictive. I keep on playing so I can keep summoning more Heroes. But I do hope that the game will update and play the full song of Owaranai Sekai De on the opening screen.",5
Awesome action rpg. Just give it a shot,5
"Love it,",5
It's good,5
Awesome game that's good for any wallet size!,5
Nice,5
"Really good game, pretty easy to use and great graphics however I don't know if I'm the only one with this issue but I just got the game and don't know how to change my character's gender :/",4
Fun and sweet,5
Decent game.,4
Great app but why does it have to be so big in storage usage,3
I very much enjoy this game. Nintendo We Love You. Thank You for making something beautiful for Mobile Gaming.,5
Very f2p friendly!,5
Fantastic game. One of the best gacha games I've played so far. I've been putting off playing this for a while and boy I sure do regret it.,5
Honestly still one of the better designed mobile games to this day! The developers are incredibly player-focused which makes a fantastic experience.,5
This game is fun with stories for all the characters and dragons. I've been playing for a while and this game has alot to offer with out paying for anything.,5
It is very fun to play and is very nice to see new characters and such but the pulls make it less fun cause of how low some of the more rare adventures and dragons are that it just becomes aggravating and wasteful of wyrmite,4
"Fun game that's fair with its gacha qualities. Controls could be a little fine-tuned, but everything else from the graphics, the music, the characters etc is great!",5
Awesome,5
great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"One of the only games I kept on my phone since it launched. Only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because I can't figure out how to level up a team properly/the strategy part to it I just can't get for some reason? Like my team nevet excels past a certain might. And I never know what to do with all those cards . They DO listen to fans though, really great game, I'd download it and give it a shot if I were you . DON'T need to pay 2 win have patience you'll get the character you want eventually.",4
A fantastic experience which is pushing the very boundaries of FTP Friendly and engaging. Not a week goes by without some cool new thing being added to do. It fills the gap that Fire Emblem Heroes left when they shafted their playerbase with PTW elements and paywalls for features.,5
Addictive and awesome!,5
It loads ever 5 second's and takes 50 years to download data! It's a fun game though 😁,3
I've been playing since the beginning and absolutely love it. While this is definitely a gotcha game they are very generous and you can honestly play all of the game without spending any money. The story is cute and the developers obviously care a ton about it. If I had one complaint they repeat events often but I feel like that wont be as big of a deal once they have a larger list of events to pull from and it usuall means easy access to needed items so I can only complain so much.,5
Play It,5
"Good game, but too much co-op",4
Got bored to it very quickly,5
Fun to watch and play.,4
polished and fun,5
"Like the art style and graphics, smooth gameplay easy to learn the game",5
"This game is a masterpiece. The graphics are really nice, and the music is really well made... the story is pretty interesting too. It astounds me that so many people are complaining about the in app purchases though, since the game is incredibly generous with its currency. The drop rates are actually very reasonable for this type of genre, I wish other gacha games would take a page out of this game.",5
very good,5
运营良心，游戏体验不断优化改进，是一款给人希望的游戏。 2019.10.16更新:高级真龙难度太高，新武器数值膨胀过快，竞速pvp搞得肝到不行，玩家分层越发明显，除top选手外体验极差。数值团队在干嘛？嫌游戏凉的不够快吗？纯堆数值，新武器攻击是旧版最强武器的3倍，让玩家投资的黑钢全都淘汰，吃相太难看了吧！还我松浦！ 2019.10.22更新：冈田执迷不悟，面对差评如潮毫无反应，反而继续喂屎！冈田，请切腹罢！ 2020.3.27更新：又過了半年，環境逐漸變好了，岡田上任時犯的錯誤也改的差不多了。總體來講還是推薦。,4
The gameplay is fine but the menus are so clunky and poorly optimized that actually getting there is a massive pain.,2
Im loving it so far Gj guys!!,5
One of the best gacha games with the most f2p-friendly.,5
This game is great! The story is captivating!,5
"Honestly love this game a lot. I've played a handful of mobile games, and this is the only one that's kept me going ever since it launched. Only tried it 'cause a friend wanted someone to play with, and I don't regret it.",5
Beautiful.....Delphi is beautiful.,5
"This game is fantastic. It has everything done correctly. Intriguing story, above par graphics, you can use any star lvl char to play and win so pick your favs. Simple to play. It's not some card collection gacha either which is so friggin nice. Gacha is so overused in Mobile games",5
"Just got into the game in time for the 1.5 year anniversary. Pretty good so far, characters are likable, gameplay is nice, graphics are great for a mobile game. Progression-wise I'm honestly kind of mixed. You can use characters or items to level your stuff but the items appear to be rare or the levels you want to play to get the items have low population until you unlock the harder versions. I dunno, maybe the problems can be overcome eventually but...",4
It's amazing do you guys think that there should be a sequel to this game?,5
"I was going to give this game a 1 because I legit believe I almost lost 2 years of data because my Nintendo account would not link with the game. I did it go 3 hours straight. I almost gave up hope, but miraclessly I it my account back. I will still rate this game as a 5 out of 5. However for anybody that is serious of devoting both time and money, make sure your able to get your account back, and also test it for yourself. Delete the game and reinstalled.",5
Best f2p gacha out there hands down! Its best time to start especially with 1.5yr anniversary,5
"Love the story, love the gameplay and love the cute characters!",5
Amazing game with equally amazing characters and music. Completely worth playing.,5
The game was good.,4
It's a good game I would like more crossover if you can,5
Good times had by all dragons,5
"people were only review bombing this fantastic game because they're shironeko apologists. jokes on you, shironeko looks like and plays like garbage idk what to tell you",5
"So fun to play, very F2P friendly.",5
Really well designed game. Devs constantly improving it. Every complaint I've had has been fixed later,5
It has a lot of style,5
"Used to love this game but now hate the direction it is going in. To a fun casual experiance to a overly difficult make one mistake and it is over choir. Expert and master hdt were a mistake that divided the playerbase After they were added the community got more and more elitist. Might gating and being denied rooms because you not running the best characters is common. As well as the ""I struggled so you must struggle too"" mentality from the remaining older players.",4
My favorite mobile game of all times. The only thing is that it's too heavy but I manage my storage so it's fine!,5
It's pretty good. Woo.,5
Awesome Rpg. Hard to believe it's a mobile game. Huge download but worth it.,5
Woop Woop Poop Poop Scoop Scoop Doop Doop,5
"The action part is excellent 2020 03 26 Cannot open the game, white screen and then shutdown",4
Played it since day 1,5
Best mobile game period.,5
"Fun game but it takes up ALOT of storage space. ;-; Cant keep the app on my phone unless I delete other media. A ""lite"" version of this app would be helpful",4
You can turn into a dragon,5
"My previous comments about end-game dark content were rendered obsloete with the newest Agito content at the time of this posting. As for when this quest gets Master difficulty, I hope they remember not to make the same mistakes.",4
Fun but jesus does it take up alot of storage this game used take up like 2 gigs but now it nearly takes up 5 seriously thing game needs to be compressed one way or another or else it will get to the point where even playing with no voices takes up more than a third of my storage if this is fixed then 5 ⭐s,2
Neat game. Fun gameplay,5
"Most accessible Gacha game. In game events give so many summoning opportunities. This also helps new places catch up quickly. Beside the Gacha friendliness, this game is a good Bala ce between grind and fun. I love it.",5
Fabulous game.,5
"its pretty fun! i got a recommendation from a friend and it sounded odd but i really do like it. i do wish it werent a gacha but it's very very generous with currency. the game also runs hot so if you don't want your hand to singe, take breaks often",4
Literally the only mobile game that matters. Looking at you FEH!,5
"Cygames spoils us. After every update, you think they can't possibly think up more quality of life improvements or add better features, but time and again they find ways to improve the game by leaps and bounds. This is the game you are looking for.",5
"There are plenty of opportunities for F2P people, and this game offers more than your average Gacha Game. It has a story that keeps you interested and hours worth of other in-depth stories from the events to even the weakest character on the roster. The music is phenomenal, so that's always something to take away if you stop playing. The main issues are the late game when people focus too much the meta. But even then there's the best part: the developers CARE. Improvements still keep releasing.",5
"Me gusta, pero no puedo pasar el tutorial de crear un Room, se queda hay infinitamente, incluso trate de usar 3 conexiónes diferentes, (Data, Hotspot, Wi-fi) ninguna sirvio, nisiquiera puedo salvar mi progreso con un Nintendo Account por que el tutorial te obliga a crear el Room a la fuerza, esperaba terminar el tutorial para hacer el link con el Nintendo Account, pero ni tuve el chance de hacerlo, hasta que arreglen esto 1 estrella supongo.",5
😡🔕‼️🖕,1
Good game,5
gg,5
Fun!,5
It seems like every other time I log in the game has to download something again.,2
Im enjoying what ive played so far. Been 45 min. And have two 5* duders and one 5* dragon. Everyone seems viable. Nice team comp. Only downside is how much memory it takes but is understandable. Ill edit in a week,5
its a great mobile game yea its big but it is worth the space,5
"I got it when it first came out, overall it's honestly a work of art. The story line and game in general is wonderful I love it so much! ✨😍 I did sadly get bored of playing it after a month, and it became one of those ""I'll play it later"" Kind of games so I did eventually delete it. But I still love it and forever will. 😊 It's one of those games that will hold a place in my heart but also one of those games I sadly won't get much time to play. 😞",5
The saving grace for the gacha games,5
Nice,5
It works! Economy isn't great but isn't as bad as Fire emblem,4
Needs to load faster in the game,4
adicting,5
It's fun for now,4
Grind fest.. and any game that separates premium currency between paid/free is a 1 star for me! BARS!,1
"Excellent Graphics, great RPG! But it has a great pitfall... It loads for everything you do! Whatever you click makes the game take ages to be responsive again! I mostly play on wifi so I don't think is my home's WiFi signal. Sad to see that such a great game suffers from this.",3
THIS IS AMAZING.,5
I love thos game,5
"I just started playing this and so far it's really fun. I can't wait to see what else this game has in stored for me. It's not congested of pay to win micro transactions and is very interested. Nintendo did a great job with this so far. I will leave an updated review later, if my view of this game changes in anyway",5
This is an absolutely marvelous game that is like the proverbial LOZ game however this product possesses a dynamic musou presence that makes me urge to keep on playing this marvelous video game. For real I love this game it's my life as of now.,3
Dragalia lost is a fun mobile game. Really easy to pick up and play. I enjoyed my time with the game. Mostly because it reminded me of phantom hourglass on the DS. Often wonder why the graphics are so blocky.,4
So far so good,4
I don't have to game but I'm planning to get it I played it in the past and its really good I really love dragons but I don't like dragon City becauseyou need food to level up and it's hard to get the food dragon a loss is people turning into dragons and it's really good and I hope it gets more updates and then new characters and the music is nice too . The game is the best game that has dragons in it that,5
Gud gayme,5
It is good but my battery goes out very fast when i play it but the game is still good,5
"It's an interesting gatcha game, havent really followed the story much since the scenes are incredibly long. The main problems I have with the game is the insane amount of data required to download to play and the loading time. Every update takes hundreds of mb or even a couple of gb. Loading time for me is so much longer than what it should be bc of it crashing and saying there's a connection error even though I have full bars.",3
"Essentially pay to win after the week or so of starting the game. This game was really good, well enjoyable with to play on my own or with a friend, but after the starter bonuses and daily summons had finished for beginners, the game became the biggest grind fest. Game has very good aspects but unless you want to pay or spend real cash for ok ish in game rewards, then you'd be better off not downloading this as it gets very stale very quick",2
"Dragalia is a pretty fun gacha game with some actual combat in it. And mean actual 3D point and click style, no static 2d jpgs. Would recommend.",5
Good game. Wish there was a way to spend single tickets in mass amounts.,3
Very fun and very accommodating to new players. The story is actually pretty good and I like all the characters a great deal. Never felt pressured to buying microtransactions. They even limit how much of a certain purchase you can make each week. It really feels like the developers of this game care about making a quality product.,5
Is the best,5
"Good looking game and plays well. Unfortunately for my experience it takes too much phone memory. After the initial download, the game continuously requires additional downloads to continue stories/quests. If it wasn't for this,. I'd definitely play this game.",3
Music gets 5 stars for me,5
😊🥰🤩👍💫,5
Good,5
To be honest this game game is really fun from any other average RPGs!,5
"Excellent game, though the slide and tap controls are a bit odd.",5
Lost all progress. Constantly restarts with cutscene and character create.,1
Great game but need too lower the storage space,4
"I absolutely love this game. The developers LISTEN to their fans, and the app does have micro transactions, BUT they are VERY generous with their recovery items and vouchers to pull for new characters. Also, if you get a character under 5 stars, i like that they arent completely useless. I can play with whatever character i really like and its always fun. One of the few games I WANT to spend my money on, because i know itll be worth it. UPDATE 2020: STILL playing this game everyday.",5
"Dragalia is a great form of reference for what I believe rpg mobile games should be. Lets start with the pros: the characters feel alive: even the ones you get from summons have their own personalities and stories that you can play through which really helps give them life instead of just being star rated jpegs that you can throw away the moment something stronger comes along. Also characters level up on their own, you dont sacrifice characters. The only con is this game takes up alot of space.",5
I play for the waifus,4
This game is simply amazing! I want to keep exploring. I am looking forward to the competitive side of this game. Real time PVP would just be too awesome.,5
Amazing and addictive,5
Fun,5
"Played since launch, making my last comment on this game before uninstalling. I appreciate that the developer put their efforts trying to build up content, things does get better little by little but still, it is kind of boring that most events are very similar. Limited team composition in co-op is another issue I found while playing. Most of the end game content requires players to do co-op, but you will find team comp is standardized as most players want to finish the grinding asap.",2
The game is great but it crashes after a few quests now ever since the new event update so it's really hard to play ☹️😣😥,2
Great game,5
Amazing story! and great graphics!,5
"Wow I'm really enjoying the game because of the graphics,abilities,character and story line.",5
Unuutth,5
I'm barely into the game so I don't really know how good it is once you get to end game. But it seems good so far.,4
"Seriously enjoying this game, I am a little kaggy at it but seriously enjoying. I feel the summon system and other mechanics are really easy to get hold of but I am just struggling. Otherwise great game and story too.",4
"Fantastic game, very free to play friendly.",1
Enjoyable it has a Final Fantasy feel to it.,5
"It's a fun game. I hope they make a version on a home console like switch, or a second game.",5
"This game is imo the best game ever, it has fun and deep game play mechanics, there are events for all players and end game content for the hardcore dedicated players community is amazing and the game is very generous. Amazing game",5
very good but just seems to have some lag in the game...,5
Love this game!,5
"Started playing this game on day 1. I played it a ton on release and then got a little burnt out, but around two months ago I started playing again and this game has surprised me with how generous the developers are. Constant updates and quality of life improvements have kept me around. A really special mobile game.",5
Why can't my favorite hero have a Mana spiral? And you still make the ugliest looking heroes and dragons please come up with cooler looking ones with a better back story.,1
"I suppose this just isn't my type of game. There's a lot of dialog, UI elements, ""stuff"" management, etc... but not much time is spent actually playing. And it's 5GB...",3
Extremely grindy. Edit: Needs a pity system or sparking from Granblue Fantasy. The summon rates are terrible.,2
Improve your loading Because it takes waaaaay to long to play,4
I can't link my account and get my progress back as it says that I can't use the app with the region settings of the account,3
Really great game I played it for awhile. But my phone crashed one day and I had to reset it. And now. I had to start from scratch is there any way I can get my account back?,4
I'm enjoying my self,5
Trash! Allow me to use a emulator and I will put money into the game. Having to run it on my phone all the time is killing my battery.,5
There are some fatal flaws with this 1 maxing out your character they have a level cap and when you get to final boss or something close that is above your level of your characters go beyond the max on them to there is a cap on reviving all the characters in party threethere's a couple of times where you can pay for revival but due to the cap on revivingwhen there is a box that has just a sliver of health left I called that still unfair. and it does not allow the tactic of bulldozing,2
"Been playing for ages now, every time I try to take a break it sucks me back in. It's rough to understand at first with team building but it's a blast. The game really carers to f2p players, immensely. You can tell the devs love the game and the balance patches are out of this world. It's just... it's fun. That's all there is to it. Fun. From upgrades, to wyrmprints, all the updates keep making it an easier to understand game and easy to pick up and catch up to play. You'll love it.",5
Much better now,5
This game is absolutely sick.,5
"Dragalia Lost is a solid game. The controls are great, the characters are decent, and the soundtrack is amazing. Cygames is pretty generous with the free summoning materials and have been quite receptive of feedback. They also haven't paywalled any quality of life updates, so that's good.",5
"Game is fun and easy to play. Gachas are a little on the expensive side, but not really needed.",4
"Came for the Daoko soundtrack, stayed for the gameplay.",5
"Splitting banners for 5 star units, especially on the Monster Hunter collab, is greedy.",2
The game is fun and has lots of ways you can make the game better including the cute dragons,5
Gacha gacha gacha euden gacha gacha,5
"There's so much to this game story,voices/voice acting,music ,animation and art. I hope one day this can be a lot more popular, maybe some dating someone elements ,and putting it on Nintendo Switch would also be nice. Either way great game .",5
"I feel like I don't particularly understand these types of games. The gatcha aspect is fun enough, but with a lot of these mobile games, they just play themselves, mostly because they aren't that fun to play manually. I want to keep giving it a try because I like the story and art and general style, but nothing about it has hooked me.",3
Woooow good,5
"All would be well... but the cutscenes sometimes lag and freeze up at the end, leaving you with no choice except to press 'Skip'.",4
"My last score for this game was a 2. I figured that was harsh. I'm giving it a 3 now. (3.5 really) There's plenty to like for people who aren't me, and I'm sure the technical issues I had are a thing of the past now.",3
I love the new dragon Nimis so much that I'm getting this game just to get him. Too bad the game requires 4 gb or something and my android can't handle that and I can't just put in an SD card. I wish this had a Switch port like PokéQuest.,5
"Great. Engaging. Direct Co-op. Very generous with currency and free pulls. Great Soundtrack. I haven't made it to endgame, but I enjoy building and trying out new characters. Only bad thing is the file size is kind of large around 6gbs.",5
It's p. good,5
If you lose your data during a transfer they refuse to help to recover your game regardless if you've been playing for over a year.,1
Cool game play,5
"game wont even get past the title screen cause it always says to come back when I have a better connection even though I've tried on my school's wifi, home wifi, data plan, ive tried everything, the support didn't help either",1
"Fun game! Cute characters, pulls usually suck but they toss out free stuff regularly !",5
"Very fun and rewarding gameplay, dev's are always listening to feedback and making the game more friendly and accessible",5
"I think the game is really good i love seeing who i get when i summon everyday but the gameplay does get dull and thats a shame, hopefully this made your desision have a nice day",4
This game is awesome with gameplay and the free stuff they give you. Probably one of the best gotcha game you can play. Isn't too stingy and does alot of free and amazing events.,4
Okay game. Combat is simplistic. The writing is mostly horrible.,3
Fun,5
F u n,5
I love the game but i have no idea how other players are able to upgrade their adventurers further than lvl 80 and idk what to do about it,5
Decent game. I haven't played much yet but so far it's pretty well done.,4
Good so far,4
Fun,5
This is possibly the best mobile game at the moment. Plenty of events and content to keep you busy.,5
Insanely addictive game with developers that listen to their user's feedbacks. Every character is useable and the developers do a good job balancing their content. They are also very generous when it comes to handing out in game currency.,5
I got into it 😆😂🙃,5
1st time playing and all can say is that it's very fun and enjoyable.,5
Ur mum a very nice woman,5
Fun and amazing,5
Pipple is now in the game and he is the most precious thing in existence. 11/10,5
Incredibly detailed for a free game,5
I took a break and came back. The pay wall has arrived. Not really feeling like grinding this one anymore. This does have great gameplay and I wish there were more games like it.,3
Awesome,5
"I'm really enjoying this game, the story is engaging and the summons are fair so far being F2P",5
A fun game to grind with great artwork.,5
"I'm bummed people are rating this low. Honestly it's great fun, the coop hits a sweet spot, the story is actually great (I usually skip dialogue boxes). People complain about not getting a 5* need to realize this is a long term game. Despite the low rates I've seen 3 and 4* characters do all the content. Also, the music is stupid addictive. I'll be humming it randomly. First game I actively turn up the volume when I play. 2020 - update, still loving the game.",5
Great game at higher levels with challenging content,5
Best game ever.,5
Amazing cutesy anime arpg game,5
"Download 500mbs to play? No problem go for it. Then it asks to download 2.8gbs. then it asks to download 3.5gbs. and it won't do it unless you leave it on the screen while it downloads. I might leave it on overnight I haven't decided if it's worth so much space. Looks like a fun game but give me a break, just make us download it all before the game starts!",3
"A very nice gacha-based game, smooth graphics (if you have a decent phone) and very reasonable f2p experience. A recommended game for those interested in gacha games.",5
Very generous dev team,5
Great,5
"This is one of those few great gatcha games that would get lost in the trash mound that is the world of horrible gatcha games. I've been playing well over a year now and haven't spent a single cent in premium currency. The Dragalia Team regularly gives out summon vouchers, summon currency, materials, etc. They have lots of great events keep things fresh and fun. Fan service is actually really restrained compared to other gatchas (*cough*azure lane*cough*) so that's a plus. Highly recommend.",5
Love it. So much to do,5
"Beautiful and well polished game, Grindy but fun. Menu animations are a tad slow, wish menus were faster especially since there are a lot with lots of stuff to do. File size is immense and even on the lowest graphical settings, my Samsung Galaxy S7 struggles from time to time causing it to overheat too. Hope they add the option to have reduced quality textures and even lower polygon count so my phone doesn't die.",4
Excellent Action RPG for mobile.,5
"Got this game when it first came out, heard about it before and was super into the concept. I still play it today, and I've never stuck with another gacha game for that long. Possibly even the best mobile game I've played.",5
Ok,5
"Not really a phone gamer, but massive Monster Hunter buff and enjoyed the tie in content - fun little time waster with no real pressure to spend money 👌",5
I love this game so much. I can play for hours and hours. I love RPGs like this.,5
Only phone game I haven't deleted. I have been playing since release and so far it keeps getting better. Keep up the good work.,5
"this game has great art work and animation's, engaging story, the english voice dubs are a nice touch. Characters are unique enough to encourage diversity. The real money options seem are pricy but completely unnecessary to progress.",5
"Best gacha I've ever played! There's always something to do, character designs are cute, music is great, and it never gets frustrating",5
Overall a fun little game with an actual good storyline for the main plot. Can't tell if it's my phone or the game but sometimes it doesn't take my taps on the skills. Other than that pretty great game,5
"Great job guys, keep it up 👍",5
Great game!,5
"Great gameplay. The story telling and cutscenes are entertaining to watch/read rather than skip. The live co-op and raid co-op mechanics are top notch. Although I'm not a big fan of gatcha type games, they give a generous amounts of resources throughout gameplay. Most F2P gacha I've played.",5
"Is gud mah dudes, I promise :p",5
"it's been updated to better quality since i first got this so many months ago. controls are still wonky but now i just use auto run. very generous to its players, thank you. also why is google asking me if this is a dentist game?",5
This game is damn near perfection. The qualms I have with it are so negligible that it's not worth going down from 5. Well done.,5
Good game love the gameplay and graphics.,5
Less then casual player just here for the art which is 5/5,5
Cute boys uwu,5
No ads and lots of things to do,5
F2p is now possible,5
Great game. I can pace myself throughout this game.,5
It's fun.,5
"Dragalia lost is Nintendo's attempt at an original IP for mobile. It comes off as new and exciting but starts to feel recycled and boring. It has decent character designs and fantastic music. The gameplay is simple yet the controls complicate it. The gacha can be brutal even with it's miniscule pity system, e.g. it took me 23 full pulls to get the character I wanted. Ultimately, it's biggest flaw comes in the form of its endgame content; it's frustratingly difficult and grindy.",3
Good game to play after doing homework,5
"It's a fun game that you level up in quickly, and they tend to give loads of free stuff away constantly!",5
its great,5
"By far the best mobile game I have ever played. It is funny, it has no ads, and it never gets boring. Although there are microtransactions, you can realistically get everything for free.",5
"This game is pretty pogChamp, no Kappa. It will leave you gachiBass'ing in no time with your FrankerZ",5
Samsung note 10 plus 5g and I crash often. I've done all types of settings from max to min. I've uninstalled and reinstalled... Doesn't matter if my phone has been off for a while or used for a long time it crashes at different points. I've used WiFi or network still crashes. Please Fix it because its not from my side.. The crashes are far too frequent for you guys not to fix,1
Loved the game so far. Dont need to make in app purchases to progress,5
I bet you wont give me Wyrmstones and free 10fold summons,5
One if the few f2p left. Havent spent anything and made an amazing team. Drop rates are decent,5
Really fun game but I wish I had some extra rolls as I didnt get any 5* people but it's still fun,5
"Great game, with a lot to do, and a very generous gacha system. Overall one of the highest quality games I have ever played on mobile. Once you get the mechanics and the different upgrade systems down, you can auto optimize or go to town on theory crafting for various events.",5
"As someone who likes FEH (and gachas in general) I thought I'd like this game! I do, but the gacha system seems so rigged, I only have three 5-stars! It's also very annoying when it keeps crashing EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. after an event co-op mission! I know it has nothing to do with ""the space in my phone"" or ""a weak internet connection"" because I have plenty of room AND I make sure I have full bars when I play, as I said before I love the game but these things are frustrating me to no end!",4
"It keeps me coming back everyday to play, whether it's the new event or checking on daily challenges, it's a lot of fun.",4
"Very enjoyable. The developer is incredibly generous, regularly giving the playerbase significant amounts of wyrmite and resources, as well as making all but the most end of endgame content be beatable with literally any unit. Few mobile games feel worth the time (or worth giving money) but this one definitely does.",5
Probably the most fun game on the play store. Feels like actual raid fights.,5
"Polished visuals but the free summoning currency dries up incredibly fast, they've give out currency pretty often though as long as you play through all the events",4
"Addictive, fairly easy until you get to endgame content. The learning curve here's ridiculously steep then. But they are adding intermediate content.",5
Fantastic game - turly viable as a f2p and the packages are reasonably priced for a gacha,5
"Great Game, Gatcha's awful.",5
A really good story and fun mechanics! Also the gacha aspect doesn't feel like it's taking advantage like other games like it.,5
"Best app game on earth. Cute music, fun and positive story, and great dialogue.",5
"The game itself is fun, the action and mechanics we're good and the music is great! But this game has one of the WORST % for it's Gatcha aspect. When you do 4 of the 10 group pulls (40 pulls) and you get one 4*, card? The rates are absolutely terrible. I got a 5* pull on my first group pull, and never got one again. I think your rates are artificially up if you've just started playing to get you hooked. Other games at least have a rising % or a cap that you'll get it after a certain amount pulled/rates won't go down. This is a terrible gambling game for these rates, and it's why Myself and my husband stopped playing after two weeks.",4
This game is so fun and addictive!! Not to mention it's very easy to get gems here!! Highly recommend for people who want to give this game a chance,5
"This is game really good and it just came out. However, since it is so early in its life cycle the game has a plethera of bugs. Given the current state i give it a 3 star rating but i could see this game easily being 5 stars.",5
Cool,5
"Easily the most generous and loved-by-its-developers gacha game that exists. Easily possible to enjoy without spending a dime, and one of the best of it's kind if you like it's gameplay.",5
I love this game,5
"Good story, easy controls, and the slice of life comics are entertaining, but it crashes on a fairly regular basis when using the team play. Could possibly be a problem with my phone",4
"very enjoyable with a lot of different content, the game is pretty fair with its gotcha system, by far the most generous of the ones i have experienced. events are fun and will keep you entertained for hours.",5
Amazing mmo for a mobile game,5
Extremely well polished game. Earned rewards and random draws feel equally rewarding.,5
Everything is good,5
"I really enjoy Dragalia Lost. Good game play mechanics, lots to do, involves some strategy, auto play feature for hands-free play during levels and challenges. Upgrade system is nice and keeps me coming back. Well done Nintendo for this game's mobile version!",5
"Really good core gameplay, with a relatively low barrier to entry. Generous gacha (though it IS gacha, be warned). Lots of regular QoL updates (some of which aren't even necessary but they do them anyway, so S/O to the devs)",5
Nice.,5
Best free to play gotcha out there,5
Good game,5
"Good, the game eats up a lot of space though.",5
1分强烈不推荐，更新的什么破玩意，垃圾死了，原来氪金一夜之间都成了垃圾，真绝了。 真香,5
Its ok now..good game,5
"This is a very addictive and fun game, my only complaint is about certain levels being too chaotic or certain events too difficult, other than that, very good game!",4
Fun,5
"Great Game, But I have to uninstall and reinstall again.",4
"Absolutely amazing game. Graphics are good. They have a good storyline along with lots of events, characters and upgrades. Any problems are resolved super quickly by a dedicated team.",5
"Great game. But dragons are the least interesting part of the game. Seems like most anime like to slap a dragon tag anything nowadays. And the game favors women a lot it seems. Currently with the new mentorship system, has endgame players coming to ""help"" newer players and are being abused badly. Pros: + At least 150 characters you can play as. + Voice acting + Excellent soundtrack Cons: - Powercreep - Toxic endgame community - Abusable mentorship feature - Lack of character diversity",2
love it.,5
best mobile rpg I have found,5
Rates are a little wonky but the game is fine.,5
I'm a day one player and I've seen the ups and downs of this game. It is currently on an upswing and getting better after a disastrous period of implementing super hardcore content. Hopefully that wont happen again!,4
5 stars since this is the closest thing to rune story I can find that's english and because nintendo did good. They didnt slack on the game at all. It's free and they give you a good experience and story. You earn your premium currency and get to spend it without restricts. Zero paywalls so far.,5
"It's okay. Decent gacha rates, but the depth of gameplay is questionable.",3
Fun,5
So amazingly beautiful,5
Games great! Super fun pocket rpg hack and slash. Definitely recommend getting into this super rewarding game!,5
Well done!,5
This game is good enough to become an anime storyline. Like Ace Attorney.,5
"Excellent 2D scroller, anime style",5
It's fun but honestly after a while gets kinda boring Story sucks and the gameplay is fun They are very generous but the gatcha isn't,3
Its a really fun game and the design of the dragons and characters have made my experience in the game even better,5
I just started and already really like it! But the only drawback is how long it takes to download after the tutorial. It's interesting to know that Fire Emblem Heroes characters are in this. Personally I'd like to see Sharena in this game because she's my favorite female protagonist.,5
"Overall it is a fun game with a good gameplay and storyline. Cant wait for the continuation of the main story. Lost 1 star because i always have problems with the connection to server even though i have a good internet connection. By the way, the bgm is soo catchy that i cant get it out of my brain. Lol",4
It was fun until it started downloading and didn't load... Not happy...,2
Good game,4
Awesome game!,5
"If you can look past the Gatcha, its a fun Dynasty Warriors clone. And i did really enjoyed it. Well it is a gatcha game.",5
I love the look of the game and that the game play isn't round based like so many rpg games. There is some in game offers for money but no blatant pop-ups to buy stuff nor is there any advertising during the game. I'm up to level 97 without any money at all. Really great to still good games that aren't just money makers.,5
Way too many loading screens...,3
Good game.delight me a lot.,5
"I have tried and played numerous gacha games. These include; brave frontier, summoners war, and fire emblem heroes just to name a few. Dragalia Lost is a game I always come back to. The gameplay is fun and rewarding. One thing that's awesome about this game is how generous and transparent the developers are. They constantly take feedback from the community. You get a sense they actually care and play the game themselves. No other game has had this type of interaction. I recommend this game!",5
"Everything about this game is absolutely stunning! The graphics are amazing, the devs are super generous, and events are always fun. My favorite mobile rpg! Thank you Cygames and keep up the awesome work, please! :)",5
"It's a nice good looking game, has a nice gacha system to",5
Really enjoying it,5
It's a good game,5
"Cant get the damn thing to download. Played through the first little part and then went on to download the main game and all it does it move .01% every other minute. When I connect to Wifi it says connection is lost even though my phone is 2 ft from my router. Being on my regular 5G network moves just as slow. Barely got to 20% after 3 freaking hours! Looks like a fun game, but from the looks of it, the makers dont want people to play bc it's so freaking slow to download!!!!",2
Good,5
Inter video game apps,5
It's a wonderful game!,5
"Very good game, nice visuals so far, and exceeds my expectations 5 stars!",5
"I don't get it why people complaining about this game. It run very smooth on my phone. plus, its far more generous than other gacha games i've played before.",5
"A game that would have been better served as a full release on the Nintendo Switch instead of a mobile cash grab. Lots of potential for RPG elements to be endearing. The desire to invest time and resources into characters and dragons is real, but the wonky power requirements for missions don't make sense. So much potential had Nintendo decided to make a fully fleshed story instead of a F2P campaign with microtransactions to get the full experience.",3
Did the current update and my game is now in Chinese or Japanese can Not change back to English Ready to remove the game.... why make an up date like this....? Other wise I enjoy your game guys....but think about the bigger picture with your up dates....in the future.,1
Amazing game keep it up with the crossovers,5
Very fun game,5
yooooo im in love wit this game lmao please make a spinoff for the switch,5
Fun game,5
Leaving the game after playing since launch. I feel like DL has just gotten very stale. The innovation has dried up and the story is going nowhere. Every event since the Fire Emblem collab has been a rerun or a reskin of the same bland content.,3
"Any RPG fan will love this. Great soundtrack, the story seems solid although I'm not far into the game. The mechanics work well, and the characters are really well done. Small touches like giving every character or dragon you summon their own little story when viewing them is what sets this game apart. Seems like a lot of work went into making this unique and not another reskin of all the games currently on the app store. Overall, great story, soundtrack, and gameplay. Cant complain bout that",5
"I like the concept, game play, and design of character. I hate the need to constantly download content. I can't continue with the chapters without having to download anywhere between 50-300MB that adds on. Not everyone has unlimited storage, a pain to have to do consistent, and you can't play without WiFi. Without that game would be better.. a lot better",2
Fun and fantastic game. Beautiful voice and animations. Fun to play and fun to summon in,5
Absolutely love this game but can't play it anymore because it constantly asks for more and more storage space but I just don't have enough anymore. Really upsetting as it is my favourite game I've played.,1
"Fun story, voice acting and controlling the combat is simple and clean. Loving my experience thus far.",4
Literally couldn't play past the tutorial,1
"More engaging, more generous, and overall better than FEH, but more competitive and grindy than FGO. Decent gacha game",1
AMAZING SOUNDTRACK and art style. The sound track seriously gets you addicted though.,5
Most fun gacha game,5
Came here for Monster Hunter and the event was already gone.,1
"Outstanding mobile game experience Great polishment on story content, very good soundtrack, eventa really well made(compare with Pokémon Masters events for example), nice unique bosses, the ratio of free to play currency is pretty good(you will get more than 15 5* units a year with that much currency spent on Gala banners). They listen a lot to the community, they game improved tons since day1. Plays great both on Redmi Note 3 and 5. The only very punishing content is endgame content.",5
Good game is good,5
"A stamina heavy game, requiring you to purchase stamina to refill and grind quests to get the resources to upgrade dragons, weapons, heros, buff cards, the buildings, and the individual hero upgrade tower (see where this is going?), or wait several, several hours to refill your gauge. At 100 stamina I could do about 4-5 missions before running out. 5 missions a day hoping to get some of the dozens of different resources/currency's to buy or upgrade something. Otherwise good graphics.",2
Was a great game but now not so much For some odd reason now i cant do co-op missions i redownloaded the game after cleaning my phone out and nothing helped...error 13 made me go from loving the game to now wondering if i should even bother with it anymore.,2
Its fun so far,4
Fun game. Nice story. I would recommend to try it.,5
I love it,5
Fun fo sho,5
"Wow cygames is amazing, this is the most f2p friendly game in the history of mobile games",5
Autoplay trash,1
Time killer,5
Yeyyy,5
Game is fun and it is alot of detail that I appreciate.,5
What do Incandescence Orb do,1
"This game used to be fun. It's got some fun mechanics and enjoyable experience but it's very very much pay to win. 10x summons rarely give you useful characters, the event characters included. Plus a 10x summon is $25. That's ridiculously expensive for something that doesn't even guarantee a useful character. Plus the game is very misleading with how strong you have to be to progress, and doesn't teach you how. Very very poor treatment of a great idea of a game.",1
Gd,5
This game has bested my expectations and I love it I'm addicted to it,5
The game itself is great but is poorly optimized for Pixel 4 XL. Currently auto battle and doing battles at 1.5 and 2x speed breaks the frame rate ... Going from 90 GHz to 10 is... Something! Hope it gets fixed soon.,2
I love RPG games and Auto play yes honey ;) i love you so much guys and girls your friend Mahmoud from kuwait god bless you all.,5
"Story: 5/10 Generic and predictable, the main character is extremely annoying. Rates: 7/10 No Sparks; character dupes are worthless. Artwork: 7/10 Pales in comparison to gbf; chibi Devs: 9/10 Qol are fast; generous. Monster hunter collab was very good, story wasnt great bc Euden is awful but overall really well done collab especially the new force strike units. MH collab bumped up the rating on my review.",5
Now they broke the monster hunter collab. They removed single summon tickets from drops and draw rates for the monster hunter limited units are fraudulent. Hundreds of draws = no Hunter Sarisse and there is still no spark feature like granblue. The DL team is a disgrace to the Cygames name. Uninstalled again,1
"Great game, lots of action, but there is a lot of reading involved",4
Yes. Just yes. Its so well made tho i wish and hope gameplay gets more... Difficult? Is that the word? Idk if thats the word but you know what i mean.,5
"Fun Aprg with an amazing soundtrack made by daoko, dont ruin this like u did feh nintendo! Please.",5
"Good game with tons of content. Summoning can be quite punishing with no guarantee and being pity-broken by off banner units. If they add some sort of token system that allows us to choose our unit after so many tenfold summons, I'd give this 5 stars. The gameplay has some real depth and most units are viable, but absolutely requires having people to play with if you want to be successful. The game is a bit laggy on my Motorola G6 Play unfortunately, but it's probably just my device.",4
It's extremely fun,5
This game is fantastic! So fun to play.,5
Great game!,5
Good game so far,5
Good try it,4
Fun game cant complain lots of free stuff from events worth it for a good time waster Personally not a huge fan of the way it controls but to each their own,4
The game is great until you burn-out from grinding to get the event character at 0.5% boosted rate and never do get it. I quit as those rates play a huge part in the game. Maybe try removing some of the characters and dragons from the roll to give reasonable rates?,4
Underated,5
Awesome and interesting game!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️,5
Great game,5
"Very fun, great story and lots of opportunities to customize",5
"I would give higher, but the RNG in this game is absolutely ridiculous. Only found out about this game through it's connection with Monster Hunter, and after approximately 150 summons, still no Hunter Berserker. With the event ending tomorrow, I'll never get one now, which is a massive disappointment tbh.",3
Good.,5
"One of the best gacha games. Doesn't rely on idle gameplay. Amazing graphics, and reasonable economy",5
The game was excellent.,5
Terrible,5
"I've spent a lot of time playing Dragalia Lost and it's been a top tier experience for the most part. It's got a great hook and will have you coming back for more everyday. It's 'gotcha' mechanics are mostly fair but are too addicting and not always rewarding. I've spent well over $400 trying to summon a single unit and never got her. For this reason, I'm done with Dragalia Lost and hope that players out there will be more responsible with it than I was. I'm done throwing my money away. I'm out.",2
"Overall Great Game. I love the voices and the amount of characters and variants to collect. I was surprised when I found out that it was made by Nintendo. My biggest problem is how much space it takes up. Finally, I really like the music put in. I would recommend this to anyone who has the space.",4
aww horrible takes long to load 😢,1
I scratch MY head and ask myself if they mislabel the price on this game... I know its gacha and i know there is microtransactions. But this is really good one with the level of polish. Ill come back and update late game review,5
Fun so far,4
Fun game thats easy on the wallet,5
"It's alright for an entry level RPG, bit that's basically it. The characters, world and story is shallow.",2
"Look geneous for free pull ticket but drop rate extremely sucks for old player, pull more than 6x10 wymite pull, not even get a single 5* adventurer. (only 1 3*new adventurer, ie look genous but fake.) more you play, more disappointed with this game.",1
"Fun game, well written and most importantly not Pay 2 Win. Good job!",5
"Love this game! Not p2w, has nice waifus and fun events. Progression is good for both casual and hardcore players.",5
Very good graphic and gameplay,5
Great game,5
操作上有點頓 內容畫風都很不錯,4
Really fun!,5
Really great fun. Very much possible to play and succeed with zero cash investment.,5
Promising ans well made so far,5
Fair f2p rewards. Recommend as a gachi game,5
"Just a really fun game with cool adventurers, an interesting story, and VERY generous devs. I would definitely recommend anyone to try it.",5
"Came back to try it for the Monster Hunter event. It hands everything to you up front, then tosses a massive wall in front of you with the Dragon Trials, poor design. The crafting system works on the first tier, then doesn't flow/explain how to upgrade weapons and costs way too much to disassemble them in case you messed up trying to figure it out. Leaving again, not coming back anymore, Nintendo you're a joke now.",1
Ruined friendships,1
Exciting,5
Noice,5
Using gs10+ and my friend is using galaxy note 10 no issues. Game is really fun and they did some good picks on the choice of music.,5
always having to download new content even after 3gb of initial downloads. controls aren't smooth for me,3
I can't get thru the title screen,2
"Best gacha I've ever played, hands down. If you play the game like a casual multiplayer game, you'll have a great time. Devs are receptive to feedback and always implementing updates and QoL. You will be treated like a player, not a money bag.",5
So far really fun.,5
Just started playing and it's a pretty interesting game so far. Love the dragon designs and with the monster hunter collab; my favorite dragon rathalos.,4
Really cute style,5
"It's an awesome game, but I cant get into the game pass few days. It goes to the title screen once you hit start its frozen. I have tried uninstalling an reinstalled it. Still doesn't work please come out with a hot fix to fix the problem",5
The game lags too much and the devs are rud as hell👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😬,1
"gameplay is great but you guys have REALLY gotta learn to compress files, the download time is ludicrous",4
"Its fun so far, gacha grind hasnt hit yet",4
The game is really enjoyable however having to go through adventurer's story is extremely tedious and I'd reccomend adding a read all button. Thanks,4
It's a well put together game,5
Great,5
"The reason why I am rating this as a one star is because I can't play on mobile devices like my iPad or Samsung phone meaning I have to play it on a computer but I for one don't have a computer. Therefore please fix this glitch because when ever I join dragalia lost it says ""authentication failed due to a network issue"" but I can go on youtube and my other apps that requires internet connection. So my internet is working but I can't play.",1
Is goode,4
"So.... 18k vs 10k cant win? Well its solo, but its 8k weaker than me and the boss still didnt feel a thing? How bout rathalos 18k?, im 18k vs 18k which should do a fair damage when i hit him ? Call that a balancing",1
"Look, I'm going to be blunt here, the main reason why I started playing this game is because the Monster Hunter crossover. I seen it on Gaijin Hunter's channel an thought ""Hey, that seems pretty neat."" But after getting into it, I'm now just here to play the campaign. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely going for Fatalis, so help me. One issue (which didn't affect me enough to take the rating down) was the downloading. Not that downloading is bad, but I wish it could be done in the background.",5
Awesome!,5
A very good game with incredible graphics and a well thought out story with amazing characters. Definetly get this game if you can.,5
fun to play and good story and soundtracks,5
Nice ecoerience,4
"I absolutely love this game, the story, characters, gameplay, graphics etc. But god damn fix your game, it crashes all the damn time in some very important moments. >:c",4
"Great gacha RPG, true Nintendo quality. Not too money-grabby and you can enjoy f2p. Please partner with Google Play Point/Rewards. :)",5
P fun,5
Amazing,5
This game is great and amazing u should try it,5
"Fun game with surprisingly good writing, gacha rates are gacha rates nothing changes there. The soundtrack is addictive and they seem to actually listen to feedback which is nice, Qol improvements are added for free, and game only seems to get better.",4
"Pretty fun soo far like, not too sure if it requires too much money but its nintendo soo its legit",4
This game is trash,5
"It's one thing to have a lot of rewards, but to click through different screens to accept the rewards and perform repetitive stuff like gifting to the dragons ... I spent only 10% of the time in the game actually fighting ...",5
Big baller flexin,5
"Regardless of the generous amounts of free currency or pulls, you will be burned. There is no safety net, no spark for those hundreds deep, and the pity break is wholely dependent on the shared pool. Unless there's a dream or platinum showcase, I can't recommend spending money on this otherwise spectacularly developed game.",2
I have been super impressed with this game ever since it came out. The developers are constantly improving game play and are trying hard to appeal to veteran players and new player alike. I am so glad that the game runs new and original events and crossover events. I am hope they continue to perfect this game and know that their hard work is appreciated.,5
Great music and the story is surprisingly good,5
I love everything,5
Amazing game! Played it for over a year and I play daily!,5
It is a great experience i just wish it was on the switch,4
Wow... Just wow. So much value for FREE,5
I'm very happy with what this game has to offer and the fact that it's free to play friendly really makes me want to put time in to it,5
This game is fun,5
"Interesting game, I'm enjoying myself a lot but I feel like it's be a lot better if I could use both my hands. Just using my right hand is tiring. Overall enjoying my start of the game so far, unlike other gachas the rates aren't terrible .",4
Highly recommended to play ..love it,5
"A fantastic gacha game! Great characters and art style, with really addicting gameplay!",5
astig ng laro. thumbs up!,5
Game soft locks on a simple tutorial. I tried redownloading everything but to no avail. Please fix your game. (Tutorial in question is after meeting the 2.1 quest archer). Edit: games cool but now I cant download the update. EDIT: Least u didn't add a $9.59 subscription every month like my other waifu game,3
"The 3d model are black. The game runs well, but the characters and some of the other details are just black figures. The ""team"" page for example is mostly black in the middle. Is my tablet just not strong enough? Do other people have the same problem? I tried messing with the settings and nothing happened. *Update* I bought a better phone and the game runs perfectly. Also figured out the ebb and flow of character progression. Great game; love the MH update.",5
Trash,5
Doing good so far. I gotta love the MH cross,4
Fun much better since i started playing,4
The gameplay can feel a bit too clunky,1
It's funner,4
Can't get in the game?,5
Its is very interesting,4
Lil grindy but gacha is extremely forgiving and tons of story,5
"Summon rates are literally scum, i must rate low for this reason alone.",2
Greatest mobile game experience I have,5
"Spent every single resource summoning over 400 units and didn't get the monster hunter, the only reason I installed. Now he is not obtainable, I will not be playing this game ever again.",1
"If you want a game so generous that it gives away the currency needed to summon regularly, once a day free ten pulls, and every unit be usable then chose this game. Plus it helps that events don't require you to dump enough money to fill the Marina Trench to be able to complete certain events like Fire Emblem Heroes, or Puzzles and Dragons.",5
You get to play with dragons. What else do you need.,5
Coop tutorial keeps crashing so cant play the game cause im forced to do the coop tutorial,3
Nice,4
Nice,5
"Cute music, cute girls.",5
"Pretty good, I really liked it a lot, especially with the events recently....buuuut holy heck the dang thing takes up a heck of a lot of space. Still, pretty good and you should totally get it.",3
Lovely game.,5
Has a good graphics and great gameplay that steadily improves.,5
Is a good.,5
On ps4,5
"So far the game is good, I'm only starting the game, we will see if my opinion changes in the future. Since March I'm still playing this great game, Love it, well done. 02-06-2020",5
Gauranteed crash after every co-op battle. Makes the recent events a miserable experience. would rate higher if not for this glaring issue. LG Stylo 4.,4
Pretty cool. Also monster hunter,4
It's good game for people that like adventure.,5
It's fun.,5
Fun.... Loveable characters. Great character development,5
"The game is visually stunning, story rich, and a great way to spend your free time. Great auto play function so you can continue through missions whilst doing other things.",5
Biggest sock,5
Very fun game and F2P friendly,5
"Great quality of artwork, characters, and overall theme. Fun and easy to play. Gameplay works without any crashing etc",5
Love it so far and the summoning currency is really easy to get. Nintendo if you're reading this please don't turn this into a fire emblem Heroes you charge $9 a month like a damn MMO.,5
"Great game! I tried it Day 1 but quit for 8 months. QoL is a huge plus for me and being able to auto-repeat stuff is great for grinding and the new revive feature is well done. It lets you redeem yourself after a mess up. I recently did a run of eHMC where i misread my alliance mate's sticker and got us both killed. Once we got up, flawless run rest of the way Finding a good alliance with a Discord or something is essential DL is also super generous with summoning mats and it is the cheapest",5
"I love this game. There are a ton of great characters to collect, and the game is very giving to F2P players. Assembling strategic teams and leveling them up is fun. The gameplay is great. There are a ton of different things to do. You can play a lot of content real time with other players. You can autoplay when just grinding for things or turn the autoplay off for more challenging stuff. The story is great. There are updates for special events. It's an all around great game.",5
I played this same from launch. It started kind of rough but has seen steady improvements over the past few years. Dragalia Lost is pretty rewarding for F2P players and there always seems to be an event or crossover coming up to keep the game fresh. I'd definitely recommend it!,5
this game is very fun except you are to overpowered and it drains space{mb} from your device,3
"Its quite enjoyable. In terms of gameplay it is very similiar to diablo. The dodging can be quite wonky at times, but if you can get use to it, its not to bad. The soundtrack is very nice and gacha rates are relatively high.",5
"Dragalia Lost is by far Nintendo's biggest and best game on mobile yet. Cygames did an amazing job developing this title. It's menus and UI are very similar to Fire Emblem Heroes, but the gameplay is so much better. The only game I think I'll enjoy as much as this is Mario Kart Tour. (Edit) Mario Kart Tour sucks.",5
"Great gameplay, music and art",5
"great gameplay, lovable character, the history is kinda dull but its always like this on this type of games. the gacha rate is good too. bunch of heroes from each pull",4
Doesn't let me play it just stays on a black screen,1
Started playing this because Mega Man is coming soon but I'm having so much fun with it! I own a Nintendo Switch so it's dope that I could log in with my Nintendo ID!,5
It is wanderful to play,5
I want to make this short awesome game and awesome staff the one making the game😁😁😁,5
Love it! This is honestly the most generous gatcha game that i have ever played. Gameplay is fun and graphics are good. I highly recommend!,5
Feels like one of the most generous and fun games in the genre.,5
"Amazingly fun game that has not once actually asked me to rate it surprisingly! the mechanics and gameplay system is immensrly fun if yourr a fan of Diablo-esque type games. Also, the devs are so damned awesome to their fans giving them so many gifts for events and bug fix apologies. Cygames is just damned awesome",5
"Amazing Game! My only problem is that the storage this game requires is MASSIVE! Tgis is the ONLY game on my device and its prompting my low storage warning. There needs to be some form of update in the future that will minimize the file size at some point. Otherwise the game is awesome and fun to play, honestly im surprised that it took me so long to play this Gem",5
"The interface is appealing and sharply designed. All of the design elements are just terrific. The story and characters are well written and well acted. The controls are simple and intuitive and actions have satisfying feedback. I really enjoy the depth or the upgrade and customization systems. Overall, this is one of the best mobile games I've played. Excellent effort!",5
"I love this game! I love how generous Cygames is and I love the designs of everything! The main story could be written better though... Also I don't really like the controls. It got better with the AI getting smart enough to dodge special attacks, most of the time, but it still doesn't feel great to play. This is due mostly to how so many of the commands are rather similar (ie: it can be difficult to get a heavy attack off when I just end up running) and how clunky moving around feels.",4
I'm having a fun time. I'm a casual player and who only plays for the story and events.,5
糞機率,1
Cool,5
"Great game overall, especially tje ost",5
tiny bit salty.,4
So is no one gonna talk about how these songs are mememe and Girl? I thought daoko would make new music for the game. (Still very pleasing that I get to hear this music more often now),5
It's super fun and I really enjoy the amount of detail in all the characters.,4
Overall good,4
"I love this game, hours of fun and engaging gameplay, constant updates and new content keep the game fresh.",5
It's got monster Hunter in it sold,5
"I usually don't play these types of games but this one is very fun, and any game that has a monster hunter crossover gets an immediate thumbs up from me!",4
Best gacha game I've ever played,5
nice controls and Not p2p. characters are well designed and theres a nice voice over.,5
I was never into these types of games but I'm addicted to this game.,5
Monster hunter colab 👌👍👏,5
I can't update to the newest version,2
More then a year later and the game has vastly improved still a good bit of improvement could be polished here and there but an amazing game.,4
It tells me to update but is already updated unplayable game will be deleting.,1
"Can't give it a 5 because it's not perfect, but this game is tons of fun. More generous than most with the numerous events with free currency and pull tickets.",4
I like it,5
"got dreadking and tamamitsune huntress on my first 10 draw, 7 out of 5",5
Noice.,5
Good,5
みんなでやろうぜ～☺️,5
"Everything I've been looking for. Level 80, never spent a dime.",5
"One of the few mobile gatcha games that feels worth it. It's simple Legend of Zelda style gameplay with charming characters and simple but feel good stories. The microtransactions are tucked away rather than in your face like most games, but the risk and reward of this game doesn't feel unbalanced. The dev team constantly rewards players and consistently balances the game as well. If you only play one Gatchapon game, this is the one.",5
So far so good. And it's not aggressive to its client base from what I can tell.,5
Easy to play. Fun characters. Easy,4
The best gacha game ive ever played,5
"Great game, great developers, great playerbase!",5
They have fixed a lot of the bad things they had at the begining and are woking on ways to make the end game content slightly more accessible for everyone. Cards are out of the summon pool which is finally a great change. Many trap banners before events so watch out.,5
PogChamp,5
Jumped on this immediately when I saw a Monster Hunter event and it has been a good time so far. . Controls are a little frustrating on smaller screens but still plenty simple so it almost doesn't matter. Beyond that...probably one of the best free RPG apps I've played!,5
Originally started playing for the Monster Hunter crossover event and got super invested in the plot and characters. This game has a lot of charm and is pretty dang generous for a gacha game!,5
"Better to start with rerolling, but lots of fun and SO GENEROUS with in game currency! Was my initial experience, however recently they have been a little predatory. For example they recently started splitting banners (which by itself is pretty crummy), and delaying the better half so you waste your saved resources on the first.",3
Pretty good.,4
To many updates,5
Great Game,5
"This game is great, before starting to play this game or before giving it a bad review, here some tips that you should know: - If you enjoy the story like as an anime in japanese, I highly recommend go to the settings - system and change voice language to japanese. The story is made in japanese, so story scenes will be fully voiced. If you choose English, there will be no vocal in the story. - If the game keep asking you to download between chapters, go to the same setting and batch download all",5
"Is fun, new player friendly, cygenerous gives lots of free summons :)",5
"Super fun, the developers keep the game interesting with new content and fun characters!",5
Been playing since Day 1 and have been blown away by the responsiveness of the devs and their willingness to make big changes. The focus on co-op gameplay instead of PvP makes it a more fun game than others I play. I'm excited to see where this game is going!,5
Only thing that could make this game better is an in game chat system outside of stickers. Great game.,5
Quite phenomenal. I have been playing for quite some time. The emulation of the raid experience on a phone is something that still boggles my mind and Dragalia Lost does it quite well.,5
"Prpbably my #1 gacha game, f2p friendly and the developers are very generous, gameplay is great, especially the music, and the character designs and lore is outstanding.",5
Legit,5
"This is my favorite mobile game over FEH, FFBE, and Last Cloudia. The story is a little silly, and people online in endgame content are real jerks about who they will play with, but overall it's a really fun game, not pay to win, and amazing player support from the devs.",5
At least they don't lock QoL features behind a paywall like FEH does.,5
"Definitely one of the better gacha games out there. They're very generous with wyrmite, the ""premium"" currency for summoning. Endgame is the same as with most gachas. its a loooong grind to reach the point where you are able to even beat the ""final"" bosses for powerful gear, but fortunately you are able to reach that point completely free, without ever needing to spend any money. Nintendo and Cygames did a great job with this game! I highly recommend this game, it's very enjoyable!",5
Naisu,5
Best gacha I've played !,5
Nicest gacha out there.,5
"Entertaining, pleasant game.",4
I'm addicted,5
Download takes to long way to much download.,3
I think I'm addicted,5
A very fun to play but easy game,4
"I honestly can't praise this game enough, it doesn't get the love it deserves and coming from a guy that plays lots of Gachas I feel confident in calling this game the gold standard of Gachas. Unfortunately it doesn't have the built in fanbase other successful Gachas have, but if you look past that you'll find a balanced game that caters to all players, not just whales, lovable characters and world design, an interesting story, constant updates with a close ear to the community.",5
Fun!,5
"Looks great, but I can't get past the title screen. Tapping does nothing",1
Fun,5
mendokuse,4
P good,5
"A fresh set of gameplay changes have made it easier than ever to break into the endgame. The Monster Hunter crossover is insanely high quality, just barely falling short of the Fire Emblem event.",5
"Awesome game but... The last monster hunter even my game has been crashing a little, plus there was this endeavor about Rathalos it never completed even when i did it over and over again.",4
"Lovely graphics, fun gameplay, great to watch even on auto (but slightly less fun), and good story.",5
The prologue is almost is almost exactly like Shining Resonance Refrain which is why I downloaded this I got this game but when I did the prologue the characters where black and when I did my name when I was downloading files it took THREE HOURS to get to 50% so I never had the chance to play thw game. Also the controls aren't the best it says to swipe the screen teh character goes the opposite way! Plz fix this the game reminds me so much of Shining resonance Refrain!😭😭😭😭,1
"Fun game, love it so far. Sweet graphics",5
This is the best nintendo game ever!,5
intuitive and satisfying,5
Very fun as a beginner so far. Plenty of free summons and nat5s.,5
"Having trouble connecting to the sever, tried all day cant get in. I can go to title screen but when I press start, it says error.",1
"Very nice, story and gameplay, always fun to play with full japanese dubbing, character are cute",4
Pretty fun game. Loving the monster hunter collaboration 🙌,5
💗My new favorite app game Of all time💗,5
"Bad gacha, no guarantee and shared rate ups...",1
"The game is fun when you get started. Seems very generous and F2P friendly, until you realize how terrible the gacha pulls are and what is required to upgrade your units. Basically, you need to pull the gacha and get duplicates for eldwater to upgrade your units' manacircles and to promote whatever you have. This is definetly a pay to win type of game. Great concept and entertaining, but, it's a serious cash dump to make any decent progress in the game. Not friendly for new players, either.",1
Thanks Nintendo,5
"Very addictive, has optional characters to customize your team, I would look up a tier list before you invest all your upgrades on certain equipment or character. 3 month in this game, so far it's been generous with events and I would take advantage of the free summon events.",5
"No idea what I'm doing, but seems fun.",4
Stupid,1
"Best free to play game. Amazing story and translation, generous premium currency, nothing locked behind real money stuff.",5
I enjoy the music and the story and combat feels fun and interective plus i do like the character design and ui all seems very smooth.,5
The best game,5
Great,5
I like the theme and feel of it I hope it comes on the switch as a full game,5
This game is fun but at times I find it confusing. Maybe that's becouse I have no history with this type of game.,4
Fun game,5
Nice rpg,5
"I'd like to give it more stars honestly, but it's a little disappointing that it does not support full screen on galaxy s9+. However, I think it's a really good game. hopefully u will add full screen soon. EDIT: I found a way to fix the issue, it appears to be a phone problem not urs sorry hahaha",5
Got into this game since they were doing a Monster Hunter Crossover and since I've been playing (4 days now) I've got pretty lucky with the free pulls. I'm enjoying the game and becoming a Dreadking Rathalos is a huge plus. :) Good combat and voice acting and combat isn't too tedious.,5
Excellent game,5
Fun,5
Good,5
Screw the gacha rates never got sarrise and got bunch of dupes,1
I like it a lot,5
Love this game,5
P good,4
First I would like to say that if you go into options you can do a mass download so you dont have to do several individual ones and second I haven't had any problems with this game and really enjoy it and I'm feel sorry for anyone who has had the game glitch or say its boring because it is a very good game to play when you have time,5
Fun polished Gatcha,5
Best,5
Good time killer.,4
"Fantastic game. Graphics, controls, content all outstanding. Crashes constantly though",5
It's very fun,5
Good Game so far hope it continues to improve,5
THE GAME WILL NOT LET ME PLAY THIS A PERSONAL PROBLEM PLS HELP,1
It good,5
Can u guy put dragon ball z characters in the game and instead of them turning to dragons they turn super saiyan....that would be awesome....just think about how amazing that should be,5
Cool game,5
"Decent QoL improvements but still has pretty bad problems. You're either overpowered or underpowered for everything. Power estimates are always wrong. 15k? More like 20k. 20k? More like 10k. Translation is always god awful and even ignores character development. It gets worse each event, too. Plus.""we have too many 5* characters, no more full voiced stories"". Then... Why are the final parts of main stories given half clips too? Budget dropping, much? Just be honest. AI still pretty stupid.",3
The artwork and music is top tier and having new weapons such as chimeratech is bridging the gap between high dragon trial weapons and revive is perfect for less experienced people to get into hdt,5
Everything work good game,5
I LOVE THIS GAME,5
Contains no pass thankfully .,5
The game opens but it never lets me play it it's like I'm forever stuck on a title screen,1
One of the few gacha games where the developers care about the players. They take a lot of consideration to player feedback and treat the players like gods even at the cost of losing potential revenue. Other games need to take a lesson from Cygames and you owe it to yourself to play this amazing game.,5
So far it's just bursting with personality and charm. Love it!,5
"A massively fun and simple action/ gatchapon game with a good tutorial. Streamlined controls, deep but not overwhelming custmisatstion, and good AI. Nothing feels frustrating. And all the art is adorable too.",5
Its cute,5
Gives you a lot of freebies which allow you to progress without making you spend a cent. Very good character designs and voice acting and backstories. Good gameplay and tools for farming. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE OVER 2GB OF RAM.,5
"Way better than expected considering the mixed opinions on this game. Great graphics, distinct and fun characters and overall enjoyable gameplay.",5
"Incredibly gorgeous, generous to newcomers. Progression is simple. Do give it a try",5
"I couldn't even play the game. 4 downloads in, my phone ran out of space. It took up almost 5GB and still not able to play. Uninstalled.",1
I'll give it a 5 star but it won't let me login me in I made progress on the game but it say to me failed to connect to the server,5
it takes way too much space 😡😡😡,1
Fun game so far.,5
Best gotcha game ever!,5
"Aesthetically gorgeous, from the pretty graphics to the really catchy tunes. Gameplay is pretty solid, can be played on one hand and also has an auto if you don't care for the pretty solid controls. Story ain't even half bad, I'm digging it.",5
"Music is amazing. Graphics and Frame Rate are amazing too. Even for 2 Gig R.A.M. Cellular Phones. But the only Touch Screen Play? The worst. I hate it. Everything else is good. Content, Settings Setting, Online Multiplayer, and Music. The horrible OnScreen reduce a Star.",4
"Incredible. Really really good, devs care about feedback, no greedy business tactics, QoL features not gated behind a paywall, lots of love and care put into the game. A+ class, cygames. Polar opposite of the trash that is Fire Emblem Heroes, if you're considering dropping Feh, you'll feel welcome here.",5
Fire🔥,5
This game does not work for euro players it never connects to the server I have 300mps this is ridiculous,1
Fun game runs well,5
Mega man !,3
The gameplay is pretty solid and the developers have made it so end-game content is easier to access by both new and veteran players. The generosity is through the roof and all of the game is accessible while F2P.,5
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥,1
High quality game,5
Simple and enjoyable.,5
Probably the only game I would actually play on my phone.,4
Great game love the collab with monster hunter,5
"I'm a simple person, I see Monster Hunter crossover, I rate 5 stars.",5
It was good,5
Good but gatcha,5
Outstanding !!,5
This game crashes far too much.,1
I can't find any free moblie game that's better than Dragalia Lost.,5
"Cant use my account now because its stuck on a story utscene tutorial after the new update. tried deleting and redownloading, clearing catch"" and my wifi is really good but no help. Really sucks that this game is having problems like this because I really wanted to play the new monster hunter event. Guess not",5
Good game.,5
Fun,5
Great game,5
Great,5
"Didnt like the game the first time because it wasn't really my time of game, but it gets really interestimg once u start playing it, not ur typical Action game that's for sure",5
"I've been enjoying this game since I launched it, specially the Monster Hunter event, as it is one of my favorite games.",5
Dfr,5
It's Granblue for dummies. Not in a bad way. Ton of fun.,5
Niiiice,5
Impossible to play. I just keep getting the same error message about failing to connect to the server. I tried to play this a few months back but had the same issue.,1
"""Server could not be reached"" on my new phone, while my old phone cant even download it... Its annoying",1
Amazing in every way,5
Unable to patch the game. I've installed and uninstalled 4-5 times. At first it would stop every other minute saying it lost connection even though I'm next to the wifi router and have full signal. Got me to 61% after an hour of clicking on try again to reconnect. Now it just gives me a can not connect to server message. I've tried with and without linking my Nintendo Account. And I have almost 10 times the neccessary space available.,1
I really like the game and linked to a Nintendo account. My issue is I got a new device and none of my saved data is transferring. I messaged tech support on the issue and have received no response. I am missing out on the current events because I cannot retreive my saved data. I do not want to start a new game.,3
Super fun and very f2p friendly! Just wish it ran better on my older phone lol but on low settings it's not too bad.,4
It good,5
Like dragons like lvling up.. rpg ish swords axes spears bright colors anime here ya go.. and its Nintendo give it a try you can always get rid of it if it's not 4 you.. it had me at dragons :),4
It is a great mobile game for sure! I just cant beleive how many duplicates i get in draws.. but besides that love it,5
I just started because of the Monster Hunter crossover. I'm a bit of a fanboy. But I gotta say. Combat is simple and easy to execute. The gatcha part is actually pretty light which is nice. Great game!,5
Great cute game,5
Great game love how generous they are with the summons it's great,5
Fun,5
MONSTER HUNTER YEEEEEEEE,5
Pleasent visuals and Systems just the Performance suffers slightly,4
The best,5
One of the most generous gatcha games out there. There is lots of content to keep players busy and lots of content to suit beginners and endgame. It's not perfect but the game constantly makes improvements,5
"Its fun, as long as it works for you. It doesnt seem to like working with wifi, choosing instead to eat up a players data if they are willing to switch off the wifi. It has plenty of events if you feel it needs them. Sadly, all those events tend to crowd out playing the story, Which would be fine if the story had already ended, but to my knowledge the game is still growing. When it first started, it barely needed more than a single Gigabyte of memory, but now it needs 4.3 (w/out voices)",3
"Only my second Gatcha, but it seems really generous and user friendly. Enjoying my time thus far!",5
Good so far just a bit of lag here and there but that could be anything,4
fun game wish you could see star levels of heros easier,5
It's a fun little game,5
Monster hunter event is really great on top of a already good game,5
"Solid rpg, decent graphics and has a fun colab going on rn.",4
Very entertaining and fresh new idea by nintendo and cygames...unfortunately their support team is really bad since recently I lost my saved data and was trying to recuperate it with them and I even showed them a receipt of my purchases but still it was not enough info to link to my account. Really sad since I played this game every day.,1
Really nice rpg game,5
Love it,5
Would have gave it more but theres no stylus support on note 10 or 10+ with the actual S-Pen. Would love to see more of my screen n' better gameplay.,3
Pretty fun dungeon crawler. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone that likes those and a good gacha.,5
Definitely a great free to play game. Every rut thing feels fair and you dont feel pressured in to buying premium. So I always feel good when I do any purchases.,5
I love turning into a dragon,5
"It's really fun, idk what else to say",5
I cant even play it always stuck on connecting to play games?,1
Im off and on but dragalia is on the right track!!! Not p2p heavy and this game is continuing to add fun activities along with features to make things more enjoyable.,5
Fun game,5
its really good (and fair),5
"Been playing for about 2 weeks. The game runs amazing, the Storyline is A+. Game is easy to learn, but still very detailed. Summons are generous. Over all, you have beautiful illustrations that you play as cute Chibis and turn is Epic Dragons with a great storyline. And the Monster Hunter event is specially unique and fun. A must!",5
"I enjoy the game. But the RNG for summining is annoying. Even with ""bad luck protection"". I'd like it if there were better packs ranging from $2 - $20. Dimantium is a bit much.",3
Amazing,5
I played this a long time ago. But everything has became better AND Monster hunter my fav gams series is here? Count me in!,5
"Good fun so far, draws from the strengths of some of Granblue Fantasy systems and then makes it's their own. Nintendo hit a winner on the head, I do the rpg with good story, along with the rng and crafting system's nicely fleshed out. Character design is great, all are likable and beautifully crafted. As are the weapons and dragons. Battles and adventures are fast, fun and engaging constantly. Leveling is simple apply the correct items and accrue points etc. Very little needs changing",5
I'm loving this game!,3
Game is great especially the ost and the generosity of the game where free players can actually slowly grind out for cash items instead of a pure pay to win format. Would support the game when I am more financially stable,5
"So many characters, yet to find one that's not useful or fun to play, the gcha is reasonable unlike so many, you play and it rewards you, simple as that. Only thing is the lvling gets a bit slanted and difficult once you do all the usual lvl maxing but still hell of a fun game",5
New gotcha percentages are trash,1
Cool,5
"Day one player: one of the best gachas I've played, no, THE best gacha I've played. Such good lore and gameplay. Characters are lovable, heck the best gay character in gaming imo, Joe, is in this game.",5
Really fun game with changing content. I've played since it came out and I'll probably play as long as they keep releasing more stuff,5
Just imagine playing fire emblem heroes over this 😂👉🤡 definitely not insulting people who do 🙉,5
"There is a problem with my game. One skill of my character suddenly disappeared, even from the character's menu. Before that I lost a battle, but it still said I cleared. Then the skill is just gone. I had unlocked the mana node for it, the node still said I unlocked it. But the ability is gone. I hope that you can fix this bug.",5
It's a good game just stick with it and it's quite fun. And it also has great later game playability.,5
"I've played this game since CBT, they listen to any inquire and other problem imediately regarding in game issue, developer team keep updating the news every day to let the players know current news, and the most thing impotant is this game quality is BEST! with free gems every day! i will keep supporting Dragalia Lost till very end(i hope no end).",5
Great,4
One of the most generous (with premium currency) free to play games on the store.,5
"Excellent game, lots of fun",5
"Dragalia has been the only app that I stuck with for more then a month or 2, the characters are charming, the dragons are awesome (at least the ones dont look straight up like a human XD), and the gameplay is simple yet incredibly fun. Some battles and raids can actually be pretty difficult, and Getting materials for upgrades and crafting is actually very fair. Story and events are very fun and sometimes interesting. Do you love dragons Do you love fun gameplay Then get this game!!!",5
They really did put love into this but yes its gotten better.,5
"I like dragon ,..... Lots of dragons here ,..... I like",5
"It's a fun MMORPG with auto play and auto combat. Whenever you complete a chapter in story, you may unlock a new character. The game contains a gotcha feature, that allows you to use Stones easily gone through objectives. You can completely play the game without spending an actual dime on it.",5
任天堂的,5
Generous and fun to play!,5
"Too grindy, bad gacha system, the building ""facility"" area is a cool idea but never really used for much, crafting endgame weapons was such a massive chore that I stopped after 1, events became a grind for summoning stones and the gameplay no longer makes it worth it. Not enough variety of gameplay and no longer fun for me (launch player) .",2
So far so good. Holding out on 5 star as I want to see how FTP it is.,4
It's alright... It's as good as any of these action RPGs get I suppose. I wish this quality were applied to a turn based rpg with quality dialogue though. It's a lot of woo woo lasers and heart magic... But it's fun.,4
3 + gigs wow too much for my phone game looks cool though uninstalling due to too much data requirements.,3
"Great art and lots of fun to play! I highly recommended, if you don't mind the grind.",5
I actually really like this game,4
Been looking for a mobile game to play and my gf told me about this. Was hesitant to plat at first but now that Ive gone through a few chapters I regret not playing earlier!,5
"Most mobile games hardly hold my interest, but I've had Dragalia Lost for over a year! The story is amazing, the game is addictive and fun, and I'm totally invested in the characters! Overall great game, and I highly recommend it to all my friends! Just make sure to watch your phone's battery percentage.",5
"There is only one issue I have, and that is the amount of storage this game takes up. Perhaps this app can have something akin to Lite Mode in Fire Emblem Heroes? It would help a lot!",4
Awesome storyline,5
Fun and looks great. Great game 9/10,5
Bro I enjoyed it but idk bout y'all,5
"Been playing since day 1. The first three months were pretty rough, but slowly this game has become more and more polished with every update. While there are a few small flaws with some of the late game balance, this game is extremely friendly for F2P and doesn't demand huge chunks of your day just to keep things running. I am very glad I stuck out the rough start.",5
"Dragalia Lost blew away my expectations, ever since Day 1, I have been playing it daily, the updates from DL is frequent enough to keep me interested everyday, from quality of life improvements to Raids bosses and high dragons, this game has room for both casual players and whalers, thanks to the dev team that worked on this game, you guys are the best, and also, nintendo characters collab please",5
"This game is actually amazing, I haven't been playing it for long but will probably be putting a lot of time into it.",5
Just started it seems like a very generous game,5
The gameplay is trash the cuteseanes are just an anima if i watched a anime and then this games cutesanes i would say its a anime but looks bad controles are weird noy bad like why can i not move and slash at the same time overall the game is better than mario run thats game is just garbage fire nintindo sick to the console games all of your mobile games are trash,1
Prolly the most f2p and challenging game I've ever played. Almost every banner they gave out free 10 fold pulls.,5
Edit: performance issues were worked out ages ago. This game is near perfection. This game is quite fun. The music is fantastic. The UI is a bit laggy and co-op net code seems a bit buggy but once the kinks are worked out this will be my go-to mobile game.,5
amazing game,4
"It's a dime a dozen gacha aiming to exploit people susceptible to gambling addiction. That's the nature of the genre, so it's expected. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't make up for it. The game is laggy, prone to desyncs, bloated, and unbalanced. The endgame content feels like it was meant for a platform with better controls and many players rightfully avoid it entirely because it just isn't fun. Spend your time and money on something more worth the investment.",1
Very friendly F2P. Many graphics option to suit one's hardware,5
So far so good.,4
Generous game. Very f2p friendly.,5
Amazing game,5
"The game starts giving Error 160 Connection Failed this morning, both on WiFi and LTE. Using a unrooted Google Pixel 2 Android 9.",5
Dope,5
Great fun must play,5
"Excellent game, generous developers, the best in the gatcha genre",5
Really love DAOKO,5
It awesome,5
Love it. Love it,5
The game is very fun. With new changes to the core system of this game. Hard core contents are no longer impossible to casual. 5/5 best mobile game.,5
Fun game,5
"Boring, cliche and overpriced gacha",1
"Most amazing mobile game I could ask for, immersive with many hours of gameplay content as expected by Nintendo and Cygame, been playing this game since release in Japan and all I can say is this game is pretty much f2p with all the freebies from the developers and events. Low level 3 star units can be made viable in end game content even accomplishing speed runs, its more focus on a players skills compared to P2W. Of course extra gem purchases would be great to support the developers. As I do.",5
good game an story,5
Fun,5
"As others have said, freemium but not pay to win/pay to play. Generous with rewards and a great time killer. Quirky storyline/characters is a bonus. Definitely recommend",5
Pretty fun so far alot of story. Load times and downloads take a bit of time though.,4
Great so far story is ok also very good gameplay and graphics,4
"The game it absolutely adorable, and if you simply play and enjoy the game you get tons of rewards. There is a lot to absorb, but it's rewarding learning how to play.",5
My experience is good just wish there was a better way to make characters walk with out having to have finger all over screen during fights an stuff like controls in corner for wking idk but still love the game alot especially the graphics,5
Game is great! Characters are cute and the voice acting is good too. The only complain I have it's that the controls are a lil funky. But overall a great game.,4
"A fun little action RPG playable with the touchscreen. Lots of lore and world building though the main story seems pretty straight forward. Graphics are anime chibi style. There are options for sharper or smoother graphics, depending on what your system can handle. Controls are simple, but tight and responsive. The RPG prep mechanics don't matter much so far. Voice acting is very anime (there is even an option for Japanese voices). Haven't had to pay for anything yet. Played on Moto X4.",4
Good,5
pretty good,4
Really fun game with a nice story and music I'd definitely recommend it.,4
Nice game,4
Devs are generous and is making constant steps to improving the game even after a year. Content comes out slow and you have to enjoy the challenging end game.,5
This game is one of the best games I've ever played but I just started today and I'm not far and I'm already overpowered because I can kill almost every single boss in a couple of hits because of my allies it is not as I thought can you make it so that you're allies can die so it cant be that easy,5
"Having an amazing time so far! The level of customization and quality of combat make it very fun. I am, however, currently having an issue where the game doesn't load into the title screen consistently. Currently it just sits at an all white screen and does nothing, please help!",4
slaps pretty hard so far!!,4
"With all the freebies this game gives out and generally pretty decent free units, how can u NOT enjoy this game and that's saying a lot for someone who's really harsh with their criticism on these mobile games personally I would like the option to play landscape cuz it just feels a lot more natural and my phone's pretty heavy when holding it horizontally lol but other than sometimes having connectivity issues, great game.",4
This game is super fun and catchy!,5
Takes up to 2+gb after installing the app if in app download. But even on high speed WiFi. Or cell signal games downloads soooo slowly 50% or less in 5 min And and if for any reason you leave the app like hit recent app tab screen turns off anything. You lose anywhere from about50% to all of whatever percentage had downloaded at that point Have made many many many attempts many many times over the last several months same thing happens every making the game completely unplayable,1
Long loading,1
Laggs alot and sometimes kicks me but other than that I'm in to it thumbs up,3
Icannot download the last 40mb of the game's data,1
Very F2Pb friendly,5
They dick you over with events and you will have no clue if they come back,2
"It's okay, just here for the MH collab",4
"Day1 player, the effort that the devs put into the game is crazy. Yes Gala Cleo is unbalanced, now they're buffing other shadow units. Yes high dragon trials are insane and meta-based, now they're making a revive system and extending the timer. Yes some stat-boosting facilities are limited, now they're adding a way to replay them. We used to have wyrmprints in the gacha making it horrible so they made them buyable with eldwater from summoning. Dragalia Life best comic xD game itself is great 6/5",5
"WAY to big of a download. Currently at 4.97gb. Ive played al9t of rpgs from google play, ive never seen one over 3gb till now and only reason i downloaded was for the monster hunter crossover lol",2
Good game not much P2W,5
Really good gacha game. Looking forward to the upcoming monster hunter collab.,5
Slow start. I'll stick with it tho because reddit thinks your great.,3
Fun thus far! Wish I found this app sooner!,3
"The only gacha game that's held my interest for longer than a couple months in a row. The characters and story are interesting, the battles are simple but fun, and Cygames has been extra generous with in game currencies for summoning and base building. Frequent seasonal events both new and returning, including 3 crossovers so far. Worth a try at least!",5
Got MH collab,5
Great!,5
"Great game! I played when it launched and got to the end game but it took far to long for lil progress and i only got a couple good summons. But I've recently returned to the game and they've made many improvements! They added a bunch of new content, both for campaign and the endgame. The power levels have increased quite a bit but I also feels like I've smashed through the brick wall that was keeping my progress at bay. And they improved the gotcha machanic by removing wyrmprints from the pool.",5
This game deserves every 5 star review it gets and more. Day one player and very experienced with gachas Positives: - Very VERY f2p friendly - Fun engaging controls that reward timing and learning fights - The devs are listening and very active. Make GREAT changes Negatives - Too f2p? Almost makes u worry about the longevity of the game - End game content is very intimidating (next update/reviving might fix this - Content can get stale. Reruns def dont help 100% worth a download to try it out,5
Great developers. This is the only phone game I've played where I feel like the developers actually listen to the community and want to make it better instead of chasing profit. The gameplay is fun and engaging.,5
It was kind of laggy and there were frame drops.,2
........ 5gb patch?,1
It reminds me of breath of fire such a great game!,5
Best gacha game I've ever seen so far. They actually care about the player base! Really F2P friendly!,5
Great game for extended play and more action and actual team based game play. Playing this game makes me think mobile gaming has advanced a long way from just timers and clickers.,5
Great fun with some good voice overs.,5
Good,5
Cool,4
Dragons.,5
👍🏻,5
"Waste of time, 5.90 gb space to download it but no thats not enough the game refuses to download and i am certainly not deleting everything on my phone just because this game is a fraud that refuses to download when clearly i have enough space on phone for it, but of course it is nintendo the worst gaming software in all of history, just give up nintendo",1
"Devs release content with no consideration of powercreep. Additionally, for a game centered around co-op, the playerbase is horrendously bad at the game and over half should be permanently banned from co-op quests.",1
Negative reviews are either dumbass specific device related issues or it's a dumbass writing it. This is probably the best gacha game (or mobile game in general) on the market rn and Cygames deserves the world.,5
simple easy and good game,3
Love everything about it except the stamina system xD.,5
Honestly it might as well be pay to play since its so big for a mobile game the only problem is it's a bit too easy at the start at least might get harder so I will probably edit this,4
"A very amazing game developed by Nintendo and Cygames, too bad it's not going to be released in europe until 2 months before this games servers will be shut down in everywhere other than Japan. 4 stars because no love for european people, like me. Thank you random Google play glitch for allowing me to download this",4
"Generous devs, lots of free summon events, content isnt too hard so doable even with suboptimal or free characters. Edit: Endgame is absolutely infuriating. You need to spend hundreds of hours farming weapons to make your team stronger, and since it's all coop, you often end up wasting 3-4 hours without a single master clear. Too tilting.",3
"Gameplay is a blast always. Dev fixed many frustrating issues with char/act progression. Summoning will always be aggrivating with an ever growing roster. It would be a great time to implement some mechanic to target specific heroes or dragons, but for now you are at the complete mercy or good or bad fortune. .. After leaving feedback, game still needs optimized for newer devices for months now. Performance issues are a crutch. Overall much better than 6 months ago. Play this game!! 😊",4
"Amazing quality! Very colorful and cute, and great gameplay. Japanese voices is a plus!",5
"I loved the game, but I just couldn't keep it. It keeps needing to download more memory with each chapter, and as good as this game is, that's a big ""no deal"" for me. Might download again in the future... If you're gonna download this, be ware that you might have to make some major space for it (current at 5GB)",4
Been quite buggy on my Galaxy S10 Plus. It gets stuck on Loading... Often when I have the Repeat option enabled.,3
Neato,4
"Amazing, super generous for free players, 10/10 just install it already",5
Good game. I like something that I can just hack and Slash.,5
"It's been pretty great, I'm not a mobile gamer and I have big hands so most games are a pain for me to even bother with. I've had no problems with this battle system and UI. Game looks great for being on a mobile device and it has actual voice acting which is always a plus.",5
I really like this game!!!!! I thought it would have been another basic phone game but it's not... it's such a great game it's fun and addictive and I enjoy the story as well :),5
"Worst Nintendo game I ever played. And I owned Iggy's wreaken balls. This is more menu than game stay far, far away.",1
Nice story line,5
"Goddamn I was expecting it to be some level of fun, but I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is bro. This app is addicting ngl, playing it with friends or in a kind alliance makes it even better too. It's waaaay more f2p friendly than I was expecting, I also really appreciate how non-toxic it is compared to some other games with online play. Honestly give this app a go annd I almost forgot you can save your data aswell so you'll never lose your progress if you login a Nintendo account 💖",5
"Dragalia Lost is a summoning game done right! It has all the base ingredients - sound, art, intuitive controls, engaging storyline, etc. but with a quality finish that Nintendo is known for. There are so many things I could commend, but I especially want to thank the designers and business people who run this game for stepping away from greedy microtransaction practices by making many of those items obtainable without selling your soul for it - this is very honourable.",5
"First mobile game I hard committed too and I definitely dont regret it. Been playing for about a month now and everything seems perfect to me. Good story, animations, and very generous f2p aspects (free summons) would reccomend atleast trying it out if you're iffy about it!",5
Awesome game,5
Have had a lot of fun playing this game with the getcha and fighting mechanic but it is a let down that you can't link your Nintendo account on more than one device without logging out of the other.,4
Better than FGO,5
"I've never seen a gacha game that's so generous, and for the gameplay, it easily could have been a paid product instead of f2p",5
Wouldnt load,1
Fun,5
"The style is a bit like Dragon Nest, but with simpler controls. The game is easy to pick up. The character design is cute too!",5
"3rd time editing: The game has made many improvements and the devs definitely listen to feedback. Gacha currency is generous and its easy to be f2p. There are a couple issues (like repeating the same old events) but given the improvements and the fact it is a very rare gacha that is easy to be f2p, it earns 4 stars.",4
So much time,5
Great game,5
This game is Amazing and I like how it's like an anime type,5
Amazing game!!!,5
Amazing,5
Every other level requires a downlaod to play.,1
"I dont mind the low graphics, but I can see where it's a concern for some people. At the games core, it's just boring. Along with the questionable control scheme, it's just unimpressive, I'll play it but at the end of the day it just takes the space that could go towards other really good games.",3
It makes you FEEL like a dragon -IGN,4
Pretty neat.,4
"My internet works fine but it kept me on the loading screen FOREVER!!!!! Now I personally love Nintendo games, apps, consoles, ect. But, I just want a anime rpg where I can still have space on my tablet. Until you fix this, it's staying at a one star review",1
Nice,4
Unique style and better then ever. You can tell they did some work on it after it launched. Nintendo doesn't disappoint with this title,5
Downloaded the game and wont even connect please fix this so your players can play,1
nice game by nintendo,5
"The game is fun but does feel pretty monotonous. I love co op when the other arent just going on auto and losing the fight. Events are plentiful too! The game throws so much premium currency at you and the general rates are pretty good. The big issue here is the rate to get the banner hero which sits at 0.645%. They need to up this to be half the total 5star rate at least. Basically if you want 5s heroes your good, but if you want the specific advertised one, good luck and hoard up.",2
"Cool game, very generous uvu",5
"Cute and clean animations, great soundtrack, but the controls leave a little bit to be desired. The whole 1 touch control thing kinda sucks. Otherwise the game is great and enjoyable",5
Pretty good,5
Love the gameplay and they addressed the problems to my complaint in less than a month Cygames has done a better job than Intelligent system ever did in Fire emblem heroes.,5
Update wont download,1
"Fun gameplay, although I haven't been playing long enough to know how I feel about the gacha and monetization system. I'll update my review after I've played long enough to understand them a bit better.",4
The graphics are great The characters are adorable and they hypnotically bounce and sway in tome with the music which is also adorable. But at the end of the day i had to force myself to play it because the core game is MIND NUMBINGLY BORING shame that.,3
it's cool,5
Can't even get past loading screen. Freezes every time.,1
Good game overall... although it took me 2 days to download...,5
"By far one of the best mobile games I've ever played. Huge fan of both Nintendo and Cygames, the collaboration is truly spectacular. Constant updates keep from anything getting old with the game. Great work! Can't wait to see more in the future!",5
Great characters and awesome storyline,5
"I'm so disappointed in Nintendo for using the (sadly more and more common) practice of designing their mobile games around predatory monetization schemes in their mobile games, and I worry that this scourge of consumer mistreatment might get carried over to their console business. You're better than this Nintendo!",1
Lots of fun,5
I went to update and it wouldn't download so I had to delete it it was a decent game though,1
So far I am enjoying the game. Love the voices,5
Dragalia lost is a great rpg and as someone who played rpgs in the past this is very good. Some problems i have with the game is that the controls can be hard if you are in a corner of your phone and that i need to waste my time for a cutscene. Other than that the game is great in every other way.,5
An amazing game with a better gacha system than most. In terms of gameplay really fluent with or without parties of 4.,5
Very fun game,5
"Gameplay is simple. Played in portrait mode, so you can forget the hassle of turning your phone. Raid with friends in 4 - 16 members. Story is fun. Community is fun too! No competitiveness of PVP so you'll be able to just play at your own pace without anyone telling you, you're doing something wrong.",5
"Great gameplay. Great game overall, only thing that I have a complaint about are the rates on the whole summoning pool. I feel like the system should have a seperate gacha for wyrmprints as wyrmprints rate are the same as both adventures and dragons combined. Other than that, great game, great devs, they fix what needs to be fixed. Edit: this post was made around release and now 7 months later and the game has improved IMMENSELY. still my favorite gacha game at the moment",5
"Fun to play. A lot to learn at first. Good graphics, voice acting and music. Would be better as a premium game.",4
"Enjoy Gacha games but never get hooked on them. Been playing Dragalia for almost 2 years now. Amazing game that does a lot right. If you need a solid Gacha game, then this is a top tier game. Pros: +Premium currency is plentiful. You don't need to spend a dime +Amazing polish and consistent art direction throughout the entire cast +The music is amazing. Daoko killed it +Easy to pick up but can be very deep +Very story driven. Lots of voices Cons: -Core gameplay can be tedious at times",5
Very fun,5
Ok,4
Awesome game,5
"Graphics are ok, gacha rates are ridiculously low.",3
"Generous and flashy. This game have some of the best colors and art direction for a mobile game. Despite its being a gacha game, its so generous that you dont have to spend a single cent to enjoy the full game content. One drawback is that is game is very grindy to reach end game content but once you reach there, there are more things to do and even more challenging things to accomplish.",5
one of the few games that lets u get tons of units,5
"It's the very best game I've played on mobile in my entire life and I've been playing mobile games since 2011,it has awesome gameplay and graphics and the music is so good that I looked up the singer and now I'm a Doako fan because of the game,also I love the fact that it's not pay-to-win at all you can get soooooo much free stuff including 5star heroes and dragons and so much more without spending almost 100$ like on most mobile games,I recommend this game to anyone who loves mobile games",5
"Great game so far,n",5
I ADORE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
ieyasu make my pp big,5
I love it wish cutscenes had voice,5
"Dragalia Lost has been a very fun experience. They give a lot of free summons and materials and I usually get lucky getting featured 4-5 stars just from those free summons. The only problem is the late game. You can NOT do any late game content with how bad the AI is. No matter how much investment you have, your team will never dodge the attacks making it impossible to complete. Co-op is an option, but it is an awful experience. Here's hoping they make it more solo friendly.",4
"Its weirdly endearing. I like the storyline thus far, legit feel like Im watching a Novella 😂",5
Very fun!,5
So far I've had a great time. Challenging but not a steep learning curve.,5
Once the of the best F2P friendly gatcha games. Great game,5
Good job. Fun game and the main had big dick energy.,4
AWESOME,5
pogU,5
"Stamina is very hard to come by yet you really need to grind to succeed in events. The updates are nice, but until they fix the fundamentals, it won't succeed. Edit: They fixed everything that everyone complained about. These devs are by far the best ones around.",5
"So cool I love how unique the gameplay is, I also love that it's not turn based like all the other gacha type games.",5
Beautifull graphics. Awesome gameplay. Well done,5
I'm big fan of Dragalia lost,5
"I really enjoyed this one, Nintendo outdid themselves once again!",5
"Beautiful artworks and gameplay, able to co-op with friends, keep up the good work. Looking forward more new updates and heroes.",5
I give all the stars its beautiful and amazing but I'm having error sending friend request when my friends list is pratically empty please fix this problem I'm unable to make friends in the game due to this error,5
"This game is amazing...for a mobile game its got me so enticed by it that i cant stop playing...the story in it, the graphics, and everything is really good i love this game",5
"Great game, love it download it. DOWNLOAD IT YA GOOFY GOOBERS",5
"Its a really great game, nearly fit for a console, but the game's size is so large that I have no way of playing it on my Andriod device, even with my 32GB SD card. I really wanna play but haven't gotten much of a chance. :c",4
Noice,5
Amazing music,5
Very friendly and f2p,4
"Cool story so far dragons & kingdoms, fun gameplay. Summon rates are no good, I had to buy packs to get a good character.",4
Screw this so I can't play because I rooted my phone seriously nintendo!!!!!!,1
Originally posted that is was a great game and for the most part it still is but it is why too repetitive and the grinding is ridiculous. Plus they introduced so many different weapons to upgrade it requires even more grinding for materials. Then there is also the doing certain tasks by a certain time making you have to log in constantly. No longer fun to play,2
"Dragalia Lost is my happy drug when I play it, and my depressant when I stop. I cannot express enough about how good this damn game is. Hell, it's my 3rd time already revising this review! DL has a very interesting routine put into the gameplay where you spend most of your time in the menu either for listening to DAOKO's beautiful music or to prepare and craft resources needed for the intense and strict yet rewarding endgame when you've completed the story so far. Give this game a shot.",5
wow! absolutley loving this game,3
fun game,5
Great,5
This .. BREATH TAKING,5
Easy to play and learn,5
Smooth and quality gameplay all around,5
Fun game!,5
Really fun even if f2p player.,5
😁,5
absolute best game ive played so far,5
Awsome,5
"Incredibly generous developers - some of the best I've seen. Coupled with the fact that the game is updated ever so frequently and is extremely F2P, this would've been an easy 5 stars. However, the direction of the game has shifted from being a casual mobile cooperative game to an incredibly toxic cesspool of trying to complete the highest content (Master Dragon Trials). Introducing fights that require neigh perfection from EVERYONE on your team are absolutely ridiculous.",3
Dragalia fixes issues with the game big and small and it keeps adding interesting adventurers every banner.,5
"I have played this game for a year now and I still play this game daily. As you play the game more, you come to realize that this game is the epitome of a Free-to-play game as the devs constantly gives the player so much in-game currency that there is no reason to spend money. Honestly, I am concerned about this as I would like to support the game but have no reason to. In response to this, I highly encourage the devs to create skins for characters that is purchased with premium currency.",5
Good game,5
Good game but size of it is too big for a phone game,5
Entertaining,5
One of Nintendo's finest work,5
It can feel like it's taking it's time but pretty good over all,4
"before I did not have this problem, I keep getting error code 160, I have not tried to do anything to this game so I dont know why I keep getting this error code. some days I get it some days I don't. How do I fix this?",1
"Never got to play, have downloaded twice and both times at the title the game hangs leaving me with a failed to connect, try again when you have a stable connection. Both on my cell data, and wifi... completely useless..",1
Garbage,1
Really good afk game and good beat em up,5
"Better than most mobile games, not a clone of angry birds or candy crush or the like, it is its own unique experience. I also appreciate how friendly is to players not wanting to spend money. If you want a fun action RPG on your phone, you can't go wrong here.",5
"Have been playing this game since day 1, it's without doubt the best mobile game Ive ever played, the gatcha system has some of the best rates and even non 5 star characters can compete with.",5
Love it,5
One of the most generous free to play games I ever played.,5
"Dragons, swords, and anime women. Groovey Music, and a unique ideas and easy to learm",5
"Drop rates are generous and in game currency is more so but no matter how many times I clear the cache, the game constantly freezes and crashes. It crashes even during level runs and it's really dampening my appreciation for this game. Support was no help and every ""solution"" listed was what I already tried. Uninstalled.",1
Super fun. I can't fault the game at the moment.,5
"Okay, first I thought Euden had a sexy voice, but OH MY GOD does Midgardsormr's accent make his voice sexy too. Luca's cute too, that Sylvan boi 🥰 I want a Zelda collab in the future, maybe even a Spectrobes collab (Yuri Lowenthal does make a really great Rallen, doesn't he?)! Also, IF I HAD THE CHOICE, I'D MAKE A SEQUEL BASED ON A FANFICTION (Yes, I'm writing one. Don't ask.) AND MAKE IT AN OFFICIAL GAME BY THE DEVS. I JUST LOVE IT TOO MUCH 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆",5
It's fun,5
Simple time killer,4
"UPDATE: After a year and almost a half, I am still playing just as much as when it launched and Im still overly in love with this game! It has so much love put into it and you can feel that it isnt just a cash grab. The devs are amazong and a lot of effort is put into the game to keep it at its best at all time. Honestly one of the best! ------ Really love this game ! Very invested in the characters and the story and just overall, so much love and care is put into it! Keep up the great work !",5
Good game,5
Awesome,5
Groovy baby,5
Love the game it has a great flow just like. Monster Hunter stories. The story plot is good as well. This would be the second game I considered great for a phone.,5
Takes up too much space on my phone,3
Seems good so far,5
I have nothing to say,1
Ama🚴‍♂️and,5
Long time ago I did a review that this game was bad but now it's amazing I highly recommend it,5
The best game in the world,5
"The game is a great hero collecting action rpg. The developers are generous in giving out resources and constantly update the game based on user feedback. Don't rush content and just enjoy the game. There is no PvP, only PvE but lots of events to always do. Updates keep the game feeling pretty fresh.",5
Androids are heartless and soulless creations of an evil empire. Thanks for the hate Dragalia Lost.,1
This game is adorable and very easy to get into,5
"Not a bad game to be honest. Just when you play everyday you will be like I have to wait for more gifts from Dragalia Lost to get my allys stronger. I just got my other Nintendo Account and restart because I thought ""maybe if I get really strong and defeat the events I never defeated then I would like this game but when I did free everything yay but one bad thing MANA. I HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS AND THIS HAPPENS!!! Overall it is a Meh.",3
All my saved data is gone again! This is twice it had happened I changed phones and no longer have access to my old one! Someone needs to contact me immediately I made purchases,1
Awesome game with cool characters! Easy to get into and doesnt require lots of money to enjoy.,5
"This game is freaking amazing!! The graphics, the sounds, the music, animation, all of the different aspects of the game are 100% authentically pleasing in every way!!!",5
I love the graphics and the story.,5
Is the crossover with fire emblem heroes over with?,5
Very f2p frendly. Engaing and fun.,5
L O V E ♥️ DAOKO Song,5
Great.,5
"Very fun, it's like being in an anime",5
"Geat game, not p2w unlike some others similar to this.",5
Very good game. However be warned endgame content can prove quite difficult for a phone game.,5
Too addicting,5
It's just an action RPG Granblue. What else do you want?,5
"Great game and all, but like gatcha game features and power creep",4
Pokemon masters is better,1
Real long first time loading but the story and game is so good!,5
Game that does not require any money to strengthen your character and always generous on all things to the game.,5
Honesty outta some of the bad mobile games nintendo has made this is honestly a very well put together game the story is interesting to watch the graphics amazing the difference characters are enjoyable to play as and it doesn't feel like money needs to be put into it it just to have the best of weapons or playing half and paying for the rest of the whole story. I can say tho the story can feel long to watch with a bit of play time is shortened but besides that great game keep up the great job.,4
"The game is really fun, the bosses do get a bit harder when later into the game but can easily countered by weapons crafted from reasources dropped by other bosses and guides from other players. If played right and you having the just the right amount of luck, you can get ledgendary heros and dragons. imo (in my opinion) the story isnt very interesting so i dont play it very often. But it is a really good game and nothing should change.",5
"Cant open the game on my xiaomi red mi k20 pro miui 11 android 10, it keeps saying error code Support Code 160",2
It's a fun story to enjoy.,4
Surprisingly high quality!,5
"Nice pretty, lots to do and quite entertaining.",5
Fun engaging game voice acting alittle bad but it's good none the less,5
Great characters if you are into anime and great gameplay may seem easy but hard to master.,5
Probably the best mobile game if you like anime.,5
Amazing game. So fun,5
Nice game,5
Sugoi,5
"The game is fun. The lack of male 5 star characters is a little annoying, and the meta is irrefutable. So if you wanna pour a ton of time in to building units you don't particularly care about or you don't care about making it to endgame effectively, it's still worth playing. (Also they fixed the controls I originally hated.)",3
"Dragalia Lost continues to be one of the best Gatcha games available. This game is a true MMO-lite, offering plentiful currency and frequent updates. You can easily earn more than 100 pulls a month by playing for a few hours a week. I have trouble playing other Gatcha games because of how much currency this game gives away. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm serious. The banner model is also very comfortable, with limited-time units being the minority. I won't claim that Dragalia Lost has great rates, but the sheer amount of free currency and pity system will give you a real shot at the featured units, without needing to buy any pulls. The game gets updated monthly with new campaign chapters or additional endgame bosses. There are occasional content droughts, but these are filled with event reruns offering great rewards or reward weeks offering double quest rewards. . The content itself is also quality. There are some reskinned bosses, but most of them offer a unique set of gimmicks/mechanics. There is some overlap among units, but all 4* and 5* units are reasonably unique with very few cases of one unit being flat out better than another. There is enough unit and equipment variety to offer depth without being intimidating. Auto-play (now with auto repeat) and skip tickets (auto complete) are avalible for most stages in the game (after being completed) outside of endgame modes. I have played Dragalia Lost since launch and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.",5
"As mobile gatcha games go, this game has nice production values... The quality shows off the pedigree from Nintendo and Cygames. Good balance between f2p grind and whales.",4
Un-optimised but really good execution of the concept.,4
"Awesome, fun, generous game",5
Was a cool game,4
"I've been playing this game off and on (due to health issues) for almost a year and a half now and I've never lost interest in it. The storyline, the characters, the events, the art, and the game mechanics are amazing beyond words! I'm so impressed by this game and how well it's put together that mere words cannot describe the overflowing excitement that swells up inside when I hear the iconic intro theme. It's a game I hope I get the honor of passing on to my kids too. Thank you 😊",5
didnt receive the pack i paid for and took over a month and a half to get my money back very upset with someone having my money in limbo for so long with only receiving automatic responses,1
Indeed OwO,5
"I had changed my reviews a few times to help people who want to play the main issues and what makes me happy about this game is that CyGames listens most.of the issues that the game had, has been fixed they improved so many mechanics and the story is finally progressing again, I hope CyGames and Nintendo keeps supporting this game because it has so much potential",5
Great game to pick up and put down and still progress pretty well 👍,5
Great game super generous with pulls,5
"One of the highest production value, generous Gacha games on the market!",5
Great,4
Seems to be a good game. Sometimes a little slow but all in all a mobile game that seems to keep some of my interest.,4
Very good game make it on the switch,5
"It's just a better granblue without an absurd grind. It's still a grind, though.",5
Really fun and interactive gameplay 👌,5
A fun experience and a story I don't want to skip through for once.,5
"From 5 star to 1 star. After new update, I can't even play the game. Because the game won't downloading the update. Now I stuck in infinity loop of animation.",1
One of the best Action RPGs made by Cygames. And in classic fashion they are a generous bunch. Worth a try,5
"Great game, but please delete mym since she's a thot. 5 stars if she's deleted and replaced with playable Mascula.",4
"Played strictly free to play for over a year, was always able to play current content without spending a dime. Great game, decent story, always something to do.",5
"controls: accidentally force strike many times, unable to move graphic: great designs, A+ effort in characters story and quotes, outbest other games but items lack theme e.g colour and info sometimes e.g slice of yule and prince looks similar. cant distinguish unbinded items. gameplay: unique co op and semi auto function. too much tap to proceed sometimes. some items difficult to grind. lazy item shop for daily specials. lacks pvp and enjoyment in adding friends e.g. no custom profile pic",4
Excellent mobile ARPG in a colorful coat of paint.,5
"Extremely generous casual gacha game. It doesn't feel like your time or your money is wasted unless you're an ultra whale. You can tell the events are made to be celbrated, and the memes are real.",5
Its pretty good,4
"I've tried many mobile games. Hundreds. But this is the only one I've never put down. This is my most consistently played mobile game ever. It's addicting, fun, unique for a mobile game, FANTASTIC story and way more. there's so much to love",5
It is a pretty good game with only a few issues but I have to give it a 3* because the data linking makes it impossible to recover you if you have to factory reset your like I did and the level difficulties are somewhat misleading.,3
Finally not a pay to win mobile game.,5
I like this game. Controls are pretty easy and the flow is great. Story is interesting. Only complaint is thats its too big of file. At this point it's taken 3.5 gig of my phone even at 32 gb phone this still takes a lot of space. Ha.,4
"Honestly the best gacha game I've ever played. Usually, games get watered down to make it more appealing to dump piles of cash onto it. With this game, I honestly never feel pressured to spend just to keep up.",5
Most f2p friendly gacha on the market.,5
"Drop rates are horrible, and it brings nothing new to the genre besides a average story and amazing sound design. Dont waste your time with this one. Edit 12/25/19: The game has vastly improved since launch. Characters get much more backstory than previous, content is challenging and skill ia rewarded. Drop rates are much better now.",5
"Great game, developers give plenty of free rewards to allow any ftp players to keep up with difficulty. Facility building times aren't terrible and reward the player by giving buffs to units making it feel worth the time. Overall it's a fun time killer.",5
"This game used 1% of my battery per minute, and then stopped it charging... All before I finished updating and beat the tutorial Meanwhile I can play Girls Frontline for 10 hours and use 60% of my battery just fine.",1
"I absolutely love this game, I've been a daily player for almost a year now. Great storyline, very nice graphics. Fair summoning mechanic.",5
Whack af right now.,4
"Amazing. Simply amazing. Awesome story, and great consideration for the free players. This game deserves way more than what it has.",5
Best phone game I have ever played. Over a year playing and it still has me by the balls.,5
"This is a gatcha game with none of the gotta get your wallet. Every character is unique, and while there is some content very difficult for crappy builds or baseline troops the game strives to give you opportunities to improve your roster. Whether this is through the freebies they throw at you all the time or the weapon crafting system or the wyrmprints or dragons. Everything builds together. Gamepress and the reddit community are active and helpful for new and old players!",5
"Good game, nice story, not pushy with ads but let's you know where you can spend if you want.",5
I play this game is extremely good never boring and entertaining that's why I get to 5 star,5
Very good,5
Very enjoyable gameplay with cool character art. It is much more fun than idle games. There are more events and all kinds of quests to capture your interest.,5
"I love this game's Story, Cool Dragon Designs, and unique events!😁",5
"I hate mobile games, but what Nintendo has done here is fantastic.",5
"Absolutely Amazing This game has been haunting me from my YouTube ads, hence I finally decided to give it a try, I've been playing for a almost a year already, and still here playing this game. A lot of my favorite Seiyuus are in this game, one of the reasons why I'm still playing it. The gameplay is fairly easy, the characters are loveable, the Main Quest is fully voiced, each characters has their own BG story so it doesn't left you with lots of questions, unlike CF xD. They also have collabs-",5
Epic game.,5
A phone game that's actually fun. Pretty generous with summons and brings back old events occasionally so new players have a chance to catch up. Constantly adding new content for the higher level players. I've been playing since launch and I'm still nowhere near maxed out. Other games got boring for me either because there was no content or it was to difficult to obtain the necessary items/characters to progress but Dragalia keeps me engaged every day.,5
It's fine,5
"I just purchased a novice bag and only got a shadow archer from the game pool, and received a repetitive character when using the 5 star character card. Its opportunity ratio is totally ridiculous as your account had 2 characters out of 5 stars only.",4
"Great characters, fun play, don't have to spend money to be successful.",5
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ UPDATE, ITS NOW CHRISTMAS OF 2019 ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR AND IM STILL PLAYINGIt's the only mobile game to has kept my attention. And it's very fast past. The graphics are great. Great story. Just all around loved it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"Over 3G download for this? Got a black screen during the minigame while downloading. Yeah, bad device. But 2 other games no issue with it. Graphics, 'cute' not for me. Controls, difficult, can't run and atk. Also more 1D in a 2D environment. Old,oldschool. Couldn't make it to the gacha but I'd assume it's just like most. Wish I had the option to just DL and wait. Speeds up the DL on other games. But 3gig, ouch",1
Game is pretty good. I'm just curious why it's only partially voiced in English,4
It wouldn't load when I got it.,2
"Don't spend in this game. You're actually more likely to get the banner items if you stay F2P, than if you buy and chase (hundreds can be spent and -not- get what's supposed to be rate up). Game itself is descending into a monotonous routine, every single game mode released is a boss fight. Boss fights with 1HKO, and that don't sync attacks. Alberian Front modes and more respect and development to the exquisite diverse characters would benefit this game. Along with better gacha. Don't spend!",1
Smooth addicting gameplay. Art design is great if you enjoy it :),5
Love this game. The graphics and character designs are great and the voice acting brings it all to life.,5
Love it. It's a lot of fun. Just wish the 3 seperate hour long downloads made it so that I didn't need internet to play,3
"A game actually good, generous and enjoyable.",5
Colorfull and oldschool Nintendo and of course turning into a dragon is awesome as well,5
"Love the music in this game. Daoko is a great singer. Gameplay is really fun. The artwork is pretty. The team are very responsive when issues pop up and are very generous. Been playing since day 1 and I can't wait for more awesome content in the future! One thing that bothers me is when old banners have new units in them, the feature unit is the new and old so that puts them a in 50/50 pool. Wish they had separate banners. I've pulled the unit I got last year so many times and not the new one.",5
Really fun game that doesn't powercreep it's units with every new banner.,5
amazing game,5
Very good game. Would definitely recommend. :),5
This is the most well polished gacha game I have ever played. Super fun so far.,5
"Christ sakes, download a bunch of content for tutorial, then download more no thank you",2
Only Gacha game I've played for more than like 2 months. Been playing since day one,5
"Say ""onii-chan"" reeeeee",1
"Edit: Recent direction of the game has left me displeased. Endgame grind is awful. The HDTs are memory tests and DPS races, and a single mistake costs you the entire fight. To make things worse, weapons are getting powercrept and it makes the effort of getting core weapons a complete waste of time and resources, all the while you need to keep hold of at least 5 weapons of all types for specific grinds. Doesn't help that the UI's a mess. Love this game, but it's too stressful to keep up with now",3
Great,5
Pretty fun game,5
"Incredible new IP from Nintendo that has great music, story, visuals, and fun gameplay that is sadly a very small part of the game. My only other complaint is the size of the app is ridiculous since every time you open it, you have to download something!",5
This game is extremely fun and you should add arean mode for you dragons to get experience plz add,5
Seems fun. Wish it had a fixed joystick rather than touch controls,5
Love this game another Nintendo hit. Wish it was on switch though.,5
Great story. Dragon stories are interesting,5
Having to go through the story missions in order to do anything else while racing against the end of the catch up campaign really sucked. I don't want to have to tap through pages of story and auto some pointlessly easy levels to get to the stuff that actually matters.,2
No comment,5
I was honestly surprised to find out dragons were in this game,4
Good game,5
Fun time,5
Wish I could keep playing it. App is just too big for my phone.,2
Nice game,5
Fun game with developers who constantly look to improve the user experience,5
Good action RPG. Fun units.,5
I great game with enough content for all. The music and story is amazing and with hopes of more future collaborations it can be amazing,5
It's a good game however the lag is real! I can't even play the game properly because of the lag! I love rpgs but this one is too laggy for me.,3
Been looking for a game like this in a while! Loving it,5
"Mobile gaming really has come a long way. This is a wonderful rpg. It has the typical gacha mechanics of similar games, but they give you alot of premium currency and items to get started so no need to pay up for those costly micro transactions.",5
Purty cool,5
"I want play this game with landscape mode and add analog for control the character, please",5
"Nice gameplay, nice story",4
Great music. Cute characters. Nintendo never disappoints.,5
"This game is absolutely phenomenal! Great music, art, gameplay, and voice acting. The story is fantastic as well. If you're a fan of good RPGs I highly reccomend.",5
Nice gameplay and mobile framework!,4
"Been playing this for a year plus now, and it just keeps on improving. Easily my favorite mobage!",5
"A fantastic game, thank you",5
yummy,4
Good game,5
Great game,5
Wonderful RPG by Nintendo for Mobile and perhaps my favourite. The game is very polished and has come a long way since it launch. The artstyle is on point and blends in perfectly with the 2D cutscenes. The story progresses well and gameplay is smooth like any Nintendo release. Must play for fans of Zelda and Final Fantasy!,5
"Asks you to update very often. The patches are also enormous. Although, the graphics are good and the gameplay is fun and original.",3
Took forever to get to the point where I could play the game. And so far it's rather straightforward,4
its alright. 4gb download. i dont like the chibi characters.,4
Solid,5
RNG for the rolls are so bad.,2
"Its fun and amazing, llus the story line is cool and especially the many different characters to summon and even dragons",5
Very fun and most generous game Ive played in terms of gacha pulls.,5
This game is awesome I enjoy it a lot,5
"An addictive time killer and fun characters, good story as well.",5
This game is great,5
Really fun,5
"Great fun, anime theme.",5
"Been a day 1 player, Cygames and Nintendo has done a great job at improving the game from lessening the grind, improving core gameplay issues and introducing difficult endgame content. The only problem is the steep learning curve for ehdts for some players, but hopefully with the new late December update they'll fix it by adding weapons that'll be better than 5t3 and void, but worse than the hdt1 weapons. If a spark system was introduced It'll make the game even better too.",5
It is the best it let's me switch characters the graphics are amazing it is cool that you can shape shift and I have only had it for 2 days and it is AMAZING everyone should have it,5
I've been playing since launch and I'm still addicted to it. Must have for all you weabos out there.,5
One visit to unlocking had no more trouble. Ok I guess,3
"Amazing. The controls, concept, story, and design of the game are amazing",5
"I enjoy this game. My biggest problem is the total size of this game currently eating 5.01 Gigs of my memory, Ouch!",4
I had gotten a legendary character I supposed cailia Phoenix or something like that and when I went to put her on my team she was there I had gotten her from a tenfold summon and I am very upset about it,1
"Very impressive game, love the storyline and gameplay",5
"Eh. The game is awesome and the Mega Man crossover is cool, but I can't even back up my save data cuz the game blacks out and restarts whenever I try to.",3
"Dosen'y usally work with my phone except only under wifi, when I played this before, I didn't really rely on wifi until December 7th. Good Gameplay but awful in the way this game works",2
Great game I love Nintendo,5
"Decent graphics and voice acting. Gameplay was subpar, just mash buttons and you win.",2
"Now this is how a mobile rpg needs to be! As far as I can tell, you're not relying on microtransactions, the gameplay is fun and the controls are fluid. Story is pretty good so far and the fact that you can build your own team from tons of characters is something I enjoy greatly. The dialogue is VERY well translated and the voiced cutscenes add a lot to the experience. I wish that the item and menu system were a little better explained but aside from that, the game is solid. 5/5.",5
It's a good game but it's quality depends on how many people are playing and a lot of people seem to have quit recently. If you can't find enough people to play with you could play with 3 other people you know.,4
Cool so far,5
"Been playing for 10 months now and I like the way Cygames handles Dragalia Lost. They're not perfect, naturally, but I feel like they've struck a satisfying balance between their f2p and whale demographies; plenty of freebies and loads of high-end content. The bosses are challenging and while some of them are gated to stronger teams, it never feels like a paywall. The art is adorable, the music is top-notch, and the devs are regularly rolling out quality-of-life improvements. Strongly recommend.",5
A dam amazing game. Yeah I could say some thing s bad about it. But l can't find any to say. Love the music and the playable characters. Just. Mmmmm.,5
Good game,5
It an amazing game. The characters have great design and the animations are beautiful.,5
Very well-managed gatcha!,5
Awful game. Purely P2P with 0.00001% summoning rates for new units. Do not waste your time.,1
"It's alright, but nothing is really keeping my interest in the game, MegaMan brought me back but isn't keeping me",4
Fairly decent game. If I was board and wanted to read to pass the time the yeah... Graphics are really nice...,4
"Dragalia Lost is, in my opinion one of the best gatcha games out on the app store. Everything is free to play and when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. The developers put a lot of care into this and it shows. The layout may take time to get used to but it's easy to play and it rather fun with a good story. I recommend trying this game.",5
"Good summon rates and of course, awesome dragons!",5
"Dragalia Lost is one of my favorite games ever! The gameplay is fun and challenging! The devs are some of the most generous gacha devs ever! Cute character designs, good looking 3d models, and awesome music makes up a visually and audibly wonderful game!",5
"It's like a Mana (Seiken Densetsu) series game, but with the best touchscreen controls you could possibly have! I would love if a compilation of all of the game's episodes was made as an offline game in the future, since no smartphone game lasts forever. I would also love amiibo of all the characters, especially the dark-skinned male knight you get as your fourth party member. He's so cool!",5
A lot of fun with a great reward and in game currency system that doesn't require LOADS of cash purchases. I have really been enjoying the game in the short time I have been playing it. Definitely plan on continuing and not uninstalling. 5/5 Will update as I play more.,5
I love Dragalia Lost.,5
Wonderful game,5
Good game,5
It's cool and co-op,5
Nice art style and controls. Story and characters are not engaging however and the music is anxiety enducing. Voice acting also leaves a lot to be desired. I tried just turning off voice and music but the game is not fun and just seems centered on collecting and microtransactions. Try Last Cloudia for a more engaging version of the same type game.,1
Great game but kinda wish the AI for the auto mode stop running into attacks and traps.,5
Great gacha and they're generous with free pulls and currency,5
Boring,1
Not even gonna lie. I'm shocked this game is free. It's pretty dope,5
Perfect,5
Nice,5
Well done!,5
MAKE THIS AN ANIME!!!!!!!,5
I actually like it! Cool game and definitely has quality graphics and great easy controls for gameplay. What caught my attention at first was the music. Very good music. Worth the download,5
"Its a good experience. Controls? Excellent, purchases? Perfectly spread out!, Events? ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I personally wouldn't change anything about this game. I got into this game for the Mega Man (or Rockman if you live in Japan) event and I absolutely enjoyed it! So hurry up and try out the game! You won't regret it.",5
"Oddly solid for such a simple game. Whether or not it stands the test of time is up for debate, but for now it has Mega Man and I'm super here for that.",4
This is how mobile games should be done! All items I want can be obtained by playing the game! I even earned Mega Man just by playing the game with him! And it only took 2 hours.,5
I love the game but to make it better you should add trading with freinds.,5
Really have had a good time with this. Never felt pressured to spend on it. Fun gameplay and nice graphics to boot! Probably the best gacha game I've played.,4
My game was wiped out even when I had my account transfer number put in. All the time and money gone. Thanks for ruining the game for people with the update. I spent over $100+ and it's all gone.,1
So far the best game,5
"best mobile game I've ever played, super generous for a gacha game",5
Exceptional,5
Very generous and challenging for a gacha game.,5
"Very nice Im excited for the story it seems interesting,the one handed controls arent too convienent i always end up with my finger at the middle of the screen after rolling but honestly pretty good im trying to get mega man thats my real reason for playing hah",4
Fun so far,4
The game is fun but the random crashes and the game just closing while summoning is complete b.s. will you ever fix it?,1
Its fun ! :),5
"Dragalia Lost is a fun experience until you get to a certain point (Void Battles and High Dragons). The game play experience is nice for 2 or 3 minutes at a time but the rest is managing a bunch of resources, crafting and buildings. Once you get to Void Battles and High Dragons, your characters are advancing at a much slower pace so you won't be able to do a lot of that content without either grinding for resources or paying for them with real money. Temporary events break up the tedium a bit",4
Fun,5
Dragalia lost is a really fun game and you'll love it and get addicted. But there's some stuff that I dislike like the co-op with your friends in real life. I just like it if you can have a party and stick with them until yall are finished. I also dislike the summoning rates. You get cards more than you can gets stuff else. But overall it's a extremely fun game.,4
I have enjoyed it. The initial interface is just a little complicated. But overall i find it to be fun.,4
Beautiful game. It's fun and controls are fairly easy. One hand does all.,5
good,5
"The only mobile game I've ever played that's fair to you as a player, and I've played a lot of them. This game respects your time. While it will do weekly events and the like like many other mobile games, it understands you have other obligations outside of the game. So most events can be easily done in little time, some of the grindier ones can be used with Skip Tickets. The game is also very generous by gacha standards. It gives you more than enough currency to play, and not pay.",5
"I don't like how emulators are blocked, now my phone battery is battered from playing all day :(",3
I love this game,5
"Don't listen to those 5* rating guys, they are clearly speaking their ""opinion""",1
anime,5
Awesome Game,5
The recent changes after the 1st anniversary are very disappointing.,1
A lot better than i thought it would be...,5
Amazing game,5
Downloaded the game strictly for mega man And I'm glad i did,4
Fun,5
Boring !!!,1
So far the game is very good. I will give it a better review once I am further in. No complaint so far.,5
Haven't paid anything for this game and still had fun. New content is added regularly. The temporary events aren't that interesting to me but the main story is worth it.,4
Very fun and addicting,5
Mega man is Awesome.......and so is the rest of the game,5
"The App is Amazing! Having access to Megaman's arsenal,having a variety of weapons at my disposal,it's amazing! Have a future collab with Legend of Zelda,Mario,Metroid,Kirby,Star Fox,Pokemon,Sonic,Splatoon,and Final Fantasy sometime in the future!",5
Awesome,4
"This game is legit! I love the art style, graphics, gameplay mechanics and overall story. Nintendo stuck the landing with this one!",5
This game should be renamed Shadow Wars as none of the characters have any definition they are all just black shapes. Even after the extra download there was no change. So for me it was irrelevant how well the game played this detroyed any hope of me becoming immersed in this game. Nintendo FAIL!,1
"Seems like a fun game so far, but it just takes way too long to load whenever i want to start playing.",2
Good game,5
Awesome,5
Good game story is good so far!,5
"You have to give it a go, it's beautiful!",5
Great,5
Pretty great ngl,5
I love it.,5
Love love this game! Love the multiplayer! Love all of the continue downloads as to me it shows that they didnt just make this game to make a bunch if money! LOVE THE STORY LINES!!!!!😍😍😍😍,5
"Takes hours to install data. Only plays in vertical, no horizontal option.",1
Nice storyline and nice graphic...but the controls kind suck.,5
It's fun. Loads a bit slow... and often. I still dont understand why the diamond prices for these games are so high. They would get more revenue if the prices were more affordable to the everyday person. Eh well... Anyway... it's a good time waster. I like it.,5
Really good so far. Seems to be fair as far as pay to play goes. I only have been playing for maybe 3 hours. Everything in the game seems fairly obtainable so far by just playing and not paying.,5
Good,5
Awesome,5
I hate how you have to keep downloading ever new stage,1
Dope,5
Such a complete package of a game,5
"The game is very unique, honest review. I appreciate the interaction with other units and also the gameplay. My only con is the game isn't very optimized even on high end phones. Very random frame drops here and there. That should definitely be focus on in small patches. I even lower the settings to focus on performance, and still frame drops randomly. Other than that, great game and happy to return for the Megaman crossover. Please continue to make crossovers.",4
Still missing something and the control to move player need to be updated to play better on the game thank you,3
It is the best game in the app store so far,5
The game is pretty fun.,4
fun,5
"I at first only downloaded the game because of the Mega Man Chaos Protocol event (me being a mega man fan) but as I started playing, I've come to love the gameplay so far and will continue to play this even after the mega man crossover event is over. This game is lots of fun and I can't wait to see what other crossovers they may have in the future.",5
For some reason I'm talking about animal crossing and reviewing Nintendos game because I'm a Nintendo fanboy,5
The game balance is utter trash which ruins an otherwise great game. GG terrible devs,1
Awesome,5
Was a good game when my device had space for it,2
Iz good.,5
not bad controls need a bit of work maybe more exploration and item discovery,4
"The game seems great (so far), but it keeps crashing.",3
This is a great game it's got great ideas and story.it's fun summoning as well.go Nintendo,5
Cool,5
Good game! Has Dragons and Dogs! PERFECT!!!,5
I noticed a little dot on screen before game starts first time after install it happened on any Android phone i tried it after that game works fine,5
"It seems like a game I would like , except it takes way too much storage space on my phone to be able to play it",3
Good rpg,5
"I have been playing this since launch and am pleasantly surprised to how far this game has come. I absolutely love the game, but my only gripe is the monotony of universal move sets to each adventurer. With the addition of MegaMan, Devs made his play style a much more unique experience. I do not know if this would be the stepping stone to future additions to different combat play styles, but all adventurers would probably then need a combat overhaul. Otherwise, amazing job thus far!",4
The rates and devs are super generous.,5
Been playing for a little over an hour and I must say I love the combat system and artwork. So far so good!,5
It is just good ya know 5stars,5
Love it,5
Great game!,5
"I just downloaded the game and I can't even play it, the game keeps saying I have a terrible connection which I don't have.",1
"Lots of freebies, good gameplay and listens to it's fans",5
It's a really run RPG with an interesting story!,5
Fun to play,5
"The music is fantastic, the gameplay is really smooth, and the dungeon crawling experience is very fun. Reminds me of reccetear: an item shop's tale.",5
Ilove dis game,5
I've been addicted to this game and then re-addicted when there is a new event.,5
A great action rpg,4
Awesome. Could simplify the uograding and it would be perfect.,5
poop pee poop epppee poop pee poop pee zoomer le monke boomer meme memem doge omg doge baby yoda boomer,1
Exciting game good Graphics easy controls decent storyline can't wait to find out what happens later on,5
"It's a tight game that plays as well as you'd expect a product from Nintendo would. Responsive controls, great anime-inspired art and a seriously boppin' soundtrack make this game a must have for anyone looking to kill some time or engross themselves in a charming, handheld adventure.",4
"So far very interesting, cute designs, nice crossovers and seems fairly more lenient in the amount of free pulls given than some apps.",4
it is a lot of fun.,5
Good game.,5
Keep improve more character events,5
This game is so incredible the gameplay the music all of it is good and they have a MegaMan event which made excited to play.,5
Great game OMG Thank you very much for releasing the game here in the Philippines,5
"So far so great , the summons are amazing and so many characters to choose from.",5
だいすき,5
The download/play/more download model is a joke. If the game is 4 gb then istall it from the start.,1
Great game with an awesome story thus far! I am enjoy the gameplay and how the controls work. It is very simple and the tutorial is simple but complete. Give this game a try and you will not regret it!,5
"Fun game, love the levels, and dragon transformations.",5
Catchy freaking bgm,5
Hooked. Its game over,5
"Game has a really good story and is easy to play. They have made lots of improvements to the game. Enough that I am increasing my rating which originally started at 1 star to 4. Game has greaty improved summoning, but still needs to separate dragons and characters from the same pool. Why its 4 star instead of 5.",4
"After waiting almost 30 minutes for a 1gig download in the game, I got to play for 5 minutes before it tells me I need to download an additional 3.3gigs. Just download it all at once you morons.",1
Pretty decent game so far control's are on point and story is good,4
The games story really grabs you quick and the cast is amazing. Simple controls definitely add to the bonus. Give the game a shot!,5
It's a fun time waster while I do my laundry.,4
"These devs actually try, things might be a bit stale outside mega Man collab but nice none the less.",5
Still trying to get a certain character,4
This game is great I am just soooooo unlucky,3
Seems really fun so far! I'm having fun with the dragons and abilities.,5
Seems like a very promising JRPG so far. I hope this gets a console release some day,4
Wonderful Nintendo experience,5
"Good game so far, not a big fan of the English voices but once you get into the game that can be changed to Japanese. Story is very well done and I am so far liking the unique playstyle.",5
"Love the game, but having difficulty on the higher lvl stuff, even in co op play. Do u guys have a discord channel to talk to other players and possibly get advice? My stuff is all over the place 😂😂 Like the final battle in chapter 10 my might rating was almost 16k collectively and zodiark almost demolished my whole team.",5
The game has a better storyline and mechanics than i expected. So far very smooth.,5
It a game where your charter can reach high levels,5
"A really fun RPG to play, and on top of that, I'm adoring all of the character designs and music so far! Definitely has Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicle vibes, so if you loved that game like me, give this a try!",5
This game amazing,5
"I've had the game installed since day one, but it was the announcement of the Megaman event that caught my attention. Anyway, the game itself is cool so far. The movement mechanic ain't the most responsive (which shouldn't be the case on a Galaxy S10+), but it's so far so good otherwise. Here's hoping there's not TOO MUCH pay to win nonsense...",4
Really solid gameplay. Probably my favorite mobile game as of now.,5
"Not much playtime so far, but the game seems fun so far!",4
A really good game. Highly recommend if you don't prefer games like pokemon masters and mario kart tour and Animal crossing pocket camps latesr EA like conduct on monetization. Controls are great and Games story is of console quality.,5
"Fun game but the pull rates are complete TRASH update 4 stars now since the drop rate improved a lot 5 stars when the controls improve, update finally rating 5* the game is in a good place",5
I've been playing this game since the start. I can't think of a developer who has listened more to feedback from players and has actively implemented changes to make the game better and more welcoming. They actively update the game with new events and adventurers and are incredibly generous with the gacha system. This has by far become one of my favorite games to play and I am always looking forward to new content for both old and new players.,5
Great game so addicting,5
"So far so good, I'm enjoying very much",5
Love the game.,5
Love this game I've been playing it for close to 48 hours straight now I am I should prolly go to bed soon,5
Really fun 👍,5
"This game is very cool, they did a good job with it. The music is very upbeat and catchy, graphics and voices are very well done. You totally need to try this game! I honestly would have passed it over but the Mega Man crossover ad caught my eye and I had to try it because I love all things Mega Man hahah",5
It's been a fun game so far. I enjoy the chili characters alot,5
"Surprisingly amazing. Don't usually like summon based RPGs, but this one is quite nice. Over all, well worth playing.",5
Great game,5
I love this game the movement on this game is incredible it has voice over and so much more I would recommend this game give it a try and thanks for the developers for making this special game for me any ways,5
This is a fun game you can pick up and play every update and roll some great units for no cost.,5
"Fun little distraction. Haven't hit the paywall yet, which is good. - 11/2018 A year later, still haven't hit a paywall. -11/2019",5
Fun game that my friend recommended to me,5
Effin Love It!,5
I love the MegaMan event.,5
Is good,5
Movement controls are a little hard to get use too but other then that its great in my book,5
I love this game,5
Awesome!,5
Excessively long (down)load screens which pause when you switch to another app force you to watch a repetitive video loop for several minutes at a time.,2
pretty good,5
Game so generous I want to spend money on this game (but I'm poor) :(,5
The best gacha game I've ever played!,5
"Wonderful ""Legend of Mana"" style adventure RPG with multiplayer, draw based team building, and turf building. Like any good JRPG it has beautiful music, endearing characters, and a story that would feel right at home in an anime. Very f2p friendly, 4* units are strong enough for events and the gatcha rates are much better than similar games I have tried, especially if you hoard currency to take advantage of the increasing odds for multiple draws during events.",5
"Fun, unique and generous",4
WHY IS IT SOO GOOD😁😁😁,5
"A very generous gacha game, with beautiful art direction, and tons of content. Be aware there is a grind wall when you get to higher level content but there is a lot to experience before you hit it.",4
Very fun to kill time. Not too pay walled for a gacha. No regrets,5
I stopped playing for a year due to work and came back to an amazing game. They just keep updating it and it gets better and better.,5
Good.,4
Great game when you put the time into it. 15 mins a day is all you need.,5
"Some of the late-game content is actually quite challenging. If you want a skill-based co-op game, this is a good choice. EDIT: They added even more high skill/high difficulty content. If you want a gacha with a great end game/late game, this is it.",5
"Wonderful story and characters. Fun and simple gameplay. Most importantly, supported by generous devs. What more could you want?",5
"Lots of fun, always a new event with something to do... my favorite so far is the fire emblem cross over event (I hope to see more like that) and bonus! I like that I can play almost everything with my friends and family.",5
played when i went on holiday to US and linked my nintendo acc. now its out in UK i wanted 2 play again on the same acc but my data is gone,5
I love this game so much this very very addicting game excellent graphics and smooth gameplay.,5
"Yeah I played a heck of a lot of gachas in my life and I can say this is one of the very best in terms of design, quality of life, developer care and events. We are spoiled.",5
"Decent enough game really. Hope to see more crossover events like the Megaman event. Maybe Link or Mario, etc some of the obvious ones. Keep the greatness going.",5
"Lovely free to play game. The devs are very generous with their in game currency. Also, Love all the new events that are put up.",5
One of the most f2p friendly and fun gachas out there. Even the story is very compelling,5
Love the game with and without friends :),5
"Best gacha I have ever tried, would recommend to anyone who likes collection games and RPGs.",5
Expensive microtransactions but fun addicting game.,5
"Hey, tired of gacha games that are so RNG heavy reliant to get far or do anything fun? Wish you could have a gacha game where you can spend $0, yes, that's right ZERO dollars and still do end game content at the highest levels? Wish you had something to grind for gear wise with awesome lookin characters, and weapons? Download Dragalia Lost, the game that literally has events that give you very good FREE units. Dragalia Lost, where endgame guides recommend using 3* characters. 200% free.",5
I'm lovin' it!,5
Very nice presentation,5
"Incredibly generous with gacha currency and is quick to address issues, provide detailed road maps, and QOL updates. Seriously, the QOL updates are insane. They make the game better in ways I didn't even know I needed. End game High dragon trials are still annoying though.",5
One of my another top favorite RPG on android,5
"Fun game that's generous also, one of the few games I haven't regretted spending money on. So far they've done a good job of listening to the community as well.",5
Best gacha game out there. Cygames are incredibly generous so you can always summon,5
Amazingly fun and addicting while being f2p,5
"Having played this for some time I can say this game is pretty good. Combat is fun, the gacha system is as fair as gacha can be. Leveling does come to a halt later on, but plenty of events will grant materials to push further faster.",5
"A fantastic game all around, love the story and all the many features.",5
"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas It's fascinating and addicting. I adore that they keep a level of tsundere, kundere. All shapes and sizes of characters and not just busty characters. Over all, the only complaint i have it the amount of Champion Testaments you can get per month with out events.",5
"Amazingly generous developers that actually listen to the playerbase. Very friendly to F2Ps, fantastic graphics and game mechanics, honestly the best game in the genre I've found. Not to mention the great community surrounding the game. Highly recommend!",5
"After the update, it crashes. Why are the characters blacked out?",3
Love it! Very Monster Hunter!,5
Yo dis game fun af,5
"The game mostly plays itself except for high end content, but it needs to be baby-sat. It's a time-waister gacha that isn't redeemed by fun gameplay.",2
Beforwarned when you're trying to link your Nintendo account!,1
"I really like this game, getting ready to buy the switch so i can play it on console.✌💪",5
"Easily Nintendo's best mobile offering. Rather than being a stripped down version of an existing property, it was clearly built with phones in mind. The monetization is really good too, you never feel like you're missing out by not paying in and even when you do you still need to actually play the game to get the most out of it. Frequent freebies, generous rates, a communicative development team, and almost constantly running events make this game a joy to play every day.",5
The game has been running great for last two months. I'm enjoying it very much now!,5
"Not a phone gamer but this is the one I'll play on a regular basis. Ridiculously polished game and even when the gatcha screws you, the devs will turn around and spoon feed you endeavors giving everything you need just for playing. Rewarding for both casuals and hardcore grinders/gamers.",5
"Great graphics, great gameplay, great endgame content challenge.",5
Great game. Graphics are not compatible on this device but still playable. I am us based on an overseas mega from like 2014 lol,5
"lost all of my data for my games whwn they were backed up through google play games and my gmail account, and the game decided to rewrite my old saves and clear my achievements.",1
this game is badass,5
"Every enjoyable experience, easy to control and understand the UI I also enjoy the artwork!",5
"A generous gacha that falls prey to powercreep and over inflated difficulty the longer it goes on. The majority of content isn't affected of course, but slowly getting more powerful to overcome a challenge only to have more difficult modes that make previous upgrades obsolete before casual players can even obtain them instead of building upon them leaves a bad taste.",3
Fun game!,5
Pretty good the black avatar glitch it taken care of. The game play its awesome. Drop rates are a bit better then most gacchas. Honestly 10/10.,5
A very generous gacha with lovely presentation and the soundtracks are cute and catchy too. As a casual I have fun with this game,5
Its okay. I dont like phone only games that much. And i dont understand the rpg system,3
First 15min have been fun,5
I'm here fo Megaman!,5
I'm addicted,5
The game just froze after the update for a few minutes. The connection error was finally fix.😄,5
recent focus on high dragons has made coop insanely unfun,1
Can't even install. Keeps saying I need more space available. 512gigs appearantly isn't enough. Unplayable at this point.,1
Looks awesome Its a shame that is not supported worldwide.,3
Amazing. Best game developer there is for gacha.,5
"Yknow i used to have a really good word to say about this game but i break now. The new uodate's interface for not onlt the main menu, but everything else, not only looks dead awful and disgusting. But buttons are too small and its not near as efficient as it used to be. It brought with it the bugs of blackened stuff back but worse. I have things not being shown, blacked out, the game skipping my summons on its own. Its a wreck that is making me wanna delete this game, day one of it.",2
"I really love the game.Cute characters,nice gameplay and most importantly,it is so generous and always keep updated.",5
"Its a good game,(although i only played the beginning)its sad I had to delete it for space",5
It anime like omg im a boy just saying,5
"Honestly my favourite game currently. The gacha system makes it really easy to get a lot of good characters. They're really cute and all have decent stories. The actual gameplay is super fun. Run around kill monsters and you get to turn into a dragon. It starts of easy and progressively gets easier while still giving a challenge. I have fun practicing my strategy on solo. And with monsters so tough you have to play co-op, dragalia really makes you try every mode.",5
"Lots of fun, but it's 3.5gb and you aren't allowed to move it onto an SD card.",5
Very very awesome,5
Amazing game,5
The story is ongoing and enticing in all the right places. The gameplay is easy to learn and is unique enough to be it's own thing. Cannot recommend it enough.,5
Super dope game. Love the jrpg feel to it,5
"Had a nice community of purely helpful PvE players. Anniversary update introduced competitive elements and one shot riddled overtuned group content. Almost overnight the community devolved into a euphanism measuring contest and a heavy ""haves and haves not"" split among the rest. Additionally limited events lock meaningful character power (~10% ) out of newer or inconsistent players reach that make being competitive much less viable. ( they plan to let you rerun these ""soon"")",2
"-Finally writing review- My friends got me into this game right before the 1st anniversary. Throughout that time this game has been extremely fun. The company takes care of their game issues and rewards players just for their cooperation. I dont usually play ""energy based games"" it is a nightmare for me, I do not consider this one because the game gives so many things to do. Best game I've ever played!",5
Cant play says i need an update. I just downloaded the game never played. I load for the first time and it tells me i need an update i hit ok and it takes me back to playstore. There's no update there hit open goes in endless loop after that.,4
Such an amazing experience,5
"By far the best app from Nintendo I ever played! Great artstyle, fun characters, catchy soundtrack, and gameplay that's extremely satisfying!",5
"I really love how the developers listen to their playerbase and implement crucial changes. They, without a doubt, deserve the ""friendliest gacha"" around.",5
Takes too much space u have to download the tutorial and then download the actual game. Multiple GB's and graphics are bad,1
"As with most Nintendo they hit the mark. Not pay to win,cute art style, and good pacing. If ya got the space for it'll bring ya a lot of fun",5
Pretty cool,5
Good game,5
very nice game play,5
Still learning good game so far,5
"Enjoying so far, love the effort put into the action animations!",5
Good game,4
Fun game,5
Honestly it's a great fun game I love the way it excites you when you get a rare drop it is kinda grindy but besides that it cool,4
Dragalia Lost is a fun game that presents itself well. People may get annoyed at the learning curve of the game. Some people may avoid the game for its Gashapon elements. You can find a review of this game and other Google Play game reviews written by me on my blog. AndroidGamingFox,4
It's pretty decent. Controls take some getting used to.,5
"I wasn't expecting much, but WOW this game exceeded every expectation! Really fun controls and the music is so good!",5
I hope this game gives me 500% on contingent wupa fruit,5
"Alright it's pretty good, I'm sorry I talked smack in it. The endgame is good too.",5
Good game which it had better combat,4
"Best game ever, the Devs are the ones who im thankful to for all their hard works.❤️",5
good game and great story,5
super fighring robot!,5
The perfect gacha game,5
Nice so far,5
Cute game and characters. Dragons make the game fun.,5
"One of the most generous gacha games out there. Cygames keeps showering their players with Wyrmite and free tenfolds one event after the other. This game is also my favorite music player, and has so many likable characters. The coop and raids are both fun as well. Yes, this game has its flaws, but I am pretty sure you'll get a great time out of it if you just try for a lil bit. One word of caution though: have a lot of phone space open because this game weighs quite a ton.",5
Great game i play it on the kindke fire couse more space it unfortanitly crashes constently luckilly it's constently saveing but if that could get fixed it whould be super convent thanks,5
If your device isn't strong enough it might not be as great because the characters might be clipped out. Otherwise a great game and would reccomend to someone with a strong device.,5
"This is a beautiful game. Fantastic graphics. Cute characters. The story is easy to follow too. However I have to stop playing because of the control. Sometimes it will be really hard to so some skills because of the lag and the stupid control. They are so similar that the game cannot registered the right action. Furthermore, some characters just have the same skill animation. And that make characters fight just the same. I so not like that not unique things.",3
"Played the game at launch and quickly dropped it due to a horrible gacha system. Recently decided to pick it back up for the FEH crossover event and found some much needed changes done to both the gacha system and QoL updates all around, and have been enjoying the game ever since.",4
One of the best Devs and mobile games I've ever played. Tonnes of events and absolutely playable without spending money :D,5
A wonderfully fun and simple game,4
I'm really injoying this game!!,5
Eh,3
Game has no idea what difficulty is. Everything is either so braindead easy you don't even look at your phone to beat it or so hard it requires memorization of a 5 minute fight where a single mistake (of you or 3 coop partners) causes instant failure. Neither is fun.,1
Amazing game!,5
Damn good fun!,5
"Probably the fairest gacha game out there. Devs are constantly adding more and more QoL improvements to the mechanics, the characters are varied and fun to read about and play, and within a month, you can probably take on at least some end-game content without spending anything.",5
"This game is just awesome to the max. It's pacing and perks are perfect! Easy to get into, impossible to put down, and you don't have to spend money. Do yourself a favour and download. I'm totally going back to play more...right now!!!",5
A fresh feeling game that feels wholesome and makes you love the cast.,5
"Terrible gacha chances, gameplay is stale",1
It improve slowly.,3
In short it's bittersweet,5
Great game so far! I,5
"A truly amazing game. One of if not the most f2p friendly gatcha game out there. Tons of content and constant, fun to play events keep drawing you back in for more. The writing is very nice, and quite humorous at times as well. I highly recommend anyone who wants a great experience to try this game.",5
Coolio,5
So cool,5
Have to download each step of the way,1
Good game so far,5
Best game ever,5
I like the voice acting in this a lot. And the overall gameplay is really great. 10/10. Love it. Some of the best waifus I've seen in gaming,5
"I had to uninstall because it overheats my phone, I loved the units, story, and concept in general and maybe once I get a new phone I'll come back, for now my old review holds as long as your phone can handle the game Old review: Best Gacha I've played so far! The controls in battle are kinda inaccurate, but the rest of the game more than makes up for it plus that may just be me sucking with touch screens in general and not the controls. If your phone supports it play it for sure!",5
Best game ever,5
Game is pretty fun,5
Used to be a great game. Now game is too difficult and takes way too much time in order to accomplish anything. Also the hardest content is co op so you are forced to play with others and their skill ranges very greatly.,1
The game is the best game ever,5
Very fun and easy to play game!,5
"Very FTP friendly. Dont need to spend your life savings to get anywhere in the game, they're more than generous with giveaways and events. Beautiful music, lovable cast of characters and fun gameplay. The only gacha game I've kept installed for a full year. The devs also listen to their community well. I've seen dozens of QoL and other such changes implemented that players have sent in as feedback.",5
Good game so far,5
Gameplay is fun. Challenge is always fair. The gatcha is super f2p friendly. Played it for about two weeks now and never have I felt the need to spend money to clear some road block. I've played a few gatchas and Dragalia Lost beat absolutely every other game in terms of ethical microtransactions. Easy 5* from me.,5
Great story i also like how every character has a story,5
Very player friendly game and fun controls,5
Fun so far. Great controls and gameplay!,5
The characters and comics are adorable :),5
"Upgrading my score to 5 stars. Stamina is not an issue, since banking is offered and there are plenty of opportunities to refill outside of account level-ups. Summons are very generous, with daily 10x pulls and pretty decent drop rates. After a week or so it's hard to avoid duplicates, but in what game is it not at that point? I have a lot of cute characters that I like, so by this point the duplicates don't bother me. Combat is fun, and can be played in a semi-auto mode (with control over dodging and dragon form), which is very comfy. The only negative I can think of is that it uses 2 forms of premium currency, one that's given as rewards and one that can only be purchased directly, with some features only taking the directly purchased currency. I guess this allows them to be more generous with the first currency, while keeping the second appealing as a purchase, but eh. Not a deal-breaker, though, the game does too much right for this to drag it down any.",5
I like it.,5
"This is my favorite gacha game. The art is beautiful, the music is amazing, and the story and characters are interesting. On top of all that Cygames are very generous and listen to the player base.",5
"Like the combat, but it's better with controllers instead of your finger.",5
Adorable little action rpg with a really good story,5
IT WAS FUN UNTIL I LEARNED THAT DIMOND THING ARE THE SAME AS WYM THINGS. ITS POINTLESS TO BUY THEM AND THE SPECIAL SUMMON IS STUPID CUZ 25 DOLLARS FOR 1 SUMMON WHICH I MIGHT NOT EVEN GET MYM FIX THIS AND PLZ PUT MYM ON NORMAL SUMMON,1
Great addictive game.,5
Very generous gacha game with great designs,5
Been playing since launch you can easily free to play if need be it's a very fun little game and support is really responsive,5
Fun and interactives with lots of grinding and things to do.,4
"Fun game, really~ The perfect thing to play with one hand on the commute from home to where ever you need to go.",5
"A great game that is fun and challenging and the developer are really good to there players. The game has great graphics, characters and dragons, story and gameplay.",5
"It's a fun game but could raise the % in getting 4 star, 5 star characters. Turns into a slot machine.Other than that I do see it's fun. As long as we can earn gems for summons, your fans might support the game. I do enjoy the option of having Japanese Dub and English Subtitles. Makes it more like an anime. I hate the English dub, voice acting. 4/5 because of the slot machine like microtransactions. Pay for convenience.",4
Noice,5
I can't express enough how much fun I've had with this game. Amazing development team that has constant updates and love for their players.,5
"I really do like this game. It is not perfect, but there is just some stuff about it that makes it stand out to me. Probably my favorite thing is that the voice actors are credited in game (you go to details then look at the art/model). I have not seen another game do this period. VA is hard work and having their names displayed is wonderful. Game play is fun too, it's fun to learn boss patterns. Only negative is there are no guaranteed units in # pulls. Sucks to pull a lot and not get feature",4
"Addicted immediately. Edit The dev's are amazing. Listen to feed back, compensate for bugs, fix unbalanced combat, and are extremely generous 10/10",5
Good game. Dragons stronk.,5
Amazing gane :),5
Awesome game👍,5
Really fun and f2p! Great and cute game!,5
I like it,5
"Downloaded this game with the intention of never playing it, but it quickly became my favorite game to play!!! I havent missed a day since starting 2 months ago. It's very chill and progression feels natural and earned. If you like MMOs give this a shot. The devs are very generous with freebies as well.",5
I love this game! The story is great seems the gameplay is fun!,5
加强技伤骗嗑,5
"Fun, but takes up so much storage.",5
Why does a update need so much storage for a few bug fixes,1
Top tier waifus,5
"most things can be done as f2p. whales will co-op with you. very fun. fire emblem collab was the best so far. I did spend $50 to get Marth. But I got Veronica, Fjorm and Elfonse for free. highly recommend.",5
"The only reason I have 4 stars is I didn't originally link my Nintendo account, lost all my stuff and customer service was not helpful in the least..",4
i cant purchase any item as i have error 24001,5
Overall very fun grind-a-thon. Story is good but not enough of it yet. Events are a nice distraction. Progress at endgame is slow but can feel rewarding. Been with it since day 1.,4
Excellent game heavily influenced by JRPG game styles.,5
Pros: easy to learn. Fun. Lots of free stuff. End game could be better,4
Very unique wish it was on console,5
"Great game, definitely the most generous gacha game I ever played. Lots of grind, which is a good thing in my eyes. Well designed characters. Enemies are a bit repetitive but you can see they are adding more unique enemies over time. Community is great too, definitely hit up the Dragalia Reddit if you play this.",4
Much better than Colpol Rune Story when it has almost the same gameplay as Dragalia Lost.,5
"An awesome mobile RPG that quickly became my #1 favourite mobile game, it's really unique.",5
Love it,5
"It's great. I'm not gonna try to explain why, you'll need to play it to understand. The community is fairly good. There's only a few bad apples, but you don't come across them too often. I don't often leave reviews, but this deserved one. The developers are constantly updating, and pour their hearts and souls into it. If something goes wrong, an update is normally released a day or so later, and they compensate the players for the inconvenience. I would write more but there's a character limit",5
Fun easy to play and rewarding Gachi game. Good graphics with thought and effort put into story.,5
Awesome,5
"Easily my favourite phone game. I say this after playing for 9 months. At first, it's a cute anime style game where the prince needs to befriend dragons in order to save the kingdom. Things get out of hand, as one would expect from anime style, and soon enough the prince is fighting against his family, creating his own legacy. The game can be as casual or hardcore as you'd like. There's a couple of events each month, bringing me back to the game with excitement! Great characters & fun story.",5
"Gacha aside, fun core game underneath. Fair to non-paying players",5
"Cygames is very generous, I'd definitely recommend picking it up if you have the space.",5
"The devs love their playerbase. A constant stream of new content and items to help newer players catch up makes for an easy to pick up game. The battles, bosses, and objectives are varied and I especially love the combat system, because the realtime fights are more entertaining than turn based combat that I'm used to seeing.",5
Love it,5
"Very fun game, great soundtracks, super cute adventures, awesome devs that listen to player advice changes and fast bug fixes, very f2p friendly, its more of a pay for faster progression than wallet warrior. ***Edit: 11/19 game hit a turn point after Oct patch, all ""fully unbinded"" best weapons became child's toy, all your investment of these weps become null. Game is still fun, but not as enjoyable. Feels like you ""NEED"" to grind compared to ""want"" to. -1 star for bad patch***",4
"A truly lovely game. I love the story and the gameplay is much more depth than one could expect. Good droprates, friendly community and challenging bosses (the high tier ones).",4
Its the best RPG on mobile by far,5
"Two stars for art, presentation and music--this game's only redeeming features. Edit: Cygames made commendable efforts at getting this game to a point of consumer friendliness not typically found in mobile games, let alone mobile gacha games. Well worth a try for fans of ARPGs.",4
"Been playing for over a year, games is fun and they have updated it so much in that time. Only problem someone may have is the memory size. Would recommend",5
LOVE ALL OF IT. Except not being able to get rid of characters you don't want.,5
Is a good game so as graphic and the story and voice actor,5
Too much space,1
Had been a great game until recently. I haven't been able to play for a few days now as there have been problems connecting to the server. Please fix this so I can go back to enjoying the game.,4
Stupid summoning event. Only give useless dragons and same characters. Too dissapointed. No new features.,1
Really solid tap em up,4
"The app keeps crashing occasionaly, especially when I summon heros. Also the app runs really slow except when I'm in a quest. Please fix this because with that aside a really enjoying the game itself.",3
Beautiful game,5
"Amazing game. Pay2win doesn't exist with the amount of freebies you get for just playing. Plenty of difficult content to work towards and the events are always enjoyable/challenging. Characters are amazing and the story/event stories are incredible. Have been playing from near launch date and it's done nothing but improve ever since. Massive thanks to the devs and team for creating such a great game! (The initial download is annoying, but worth it!)",5
"Been playing for over a year, it's the gold-standard for gotchas. Ruined other gotchas for me. Great story(ies), great auto and manual play, great characters, simple currency, and VERY generous devs.",5
Yeeted a top tier 5* on first summon lol,5
Great game. getting worse all the time. whats the point collecting and leveling dragons when bosses have some ability that stops the gauge from filling? you only need dragons for bosses. its almost impossible to play many new levels by your self but that same level can sometimes be accomplished in 15 seconds or less with other players even if every character is significantly lower level than your own. what are numbers any way? suggested 12500 lol.18500 cant do 1/3 damage.Co-op mandatory now.,2
"It's a cute/fun game! The grind is real, but co-op is a thing added the story/artwork is sweet. Mym is best girl, follow the game on reddit; you will not be disappointed (maybe :) )",5
"Great game, cool gameplay",5
"Hero's and dragons looks awful tbh. They are all washed out, there's no detail and hardly any textures to them.",3
smooth game,5
Great game,5
I Like the graphics gameplay and everything this is the best game ever Keep up the Good work!,5
Interesting story with an enjoyable cast of characters.,5
"I was able to play on my phone with this app but it needed an update so now it won't download now , and I've had to uninstall several apps to play this game , this game requires too much space",1
It's fun but the arrow is little too big,4
Its a fun game but the amount of data it takes is crazy,4
Nice,5
One of my go to games. Art is great and story is a lot of fun. The rate for featured characters is pretty grabage at only .5% meaning you're very unlikely to get a featured unit. Add a spark system like in GranBlue and it would be an easy 5,4
neat,4
Cool,5
best phone game that exists,5
"Very Fun, but a long downloading period!",5
"Nice balance of story and crazy party upgrading / expanding by summoning characters unrelated to the part of the story you're in. Has a lot of the same mechanics that Fire Emblem Heroes does in that regard, but the story moves along at a better clip and... Feels less dumb, I guess? You could start to care about these characters, at least.",4
This game is very cute!!!,5
"recommended 7000, but still fail with 13000??????",3
What a game Nintendo and bad games the last years is something 🤣,1
"The game is fun, the art is great, the music is good, and the devs hand out a lot of free stuff for players. Easy to get started and get to most endgame content without having to shovel a ton of money into it.",5
"I love grand blue Fantasy, this game is funnier in certain way I like it",5
Technically it's 5 star all around in my opinion. My only problem is that you should take off the cart option when buying gems packages etc. It glitches out and now I can't buy anything at all. I've been with the game since day 1 I even tried to contact your Facebook but no reply. This a serious bug that needs to be fixed.,1
One of the best mobile games. Fun combat and they respect their players!,5
Cool game,5
The game is really good except for some performance issues on slower devices,4
Best mobile game I have ever played,5
Gay,1
Very fun,5
"It started great, but soon every event had characters with new skills that built on each other. So there were like 3 characters that had the skill. To many new skills at once.",1
Awesome game but takes a very long ass time for the update. It should have been that the complete update downloads at playstore in the background but it doesnt so i hope that the developers work on that flaw.,3
Okada ruined this game.,1
"Great graphics, voice acting is superb (even the english one lol), and the level up customization and upgrading is vast. Beautiful little game that doesnt require money to enjoy it.",5
cool,5
Very addicting game .. can't put my phone down since I started playing! Definitely worth the downloading time to play,5
"You can hear the signature switch click when playing this game! It's a battery drainer but it looks pretty good and has a lot of stuff going on. As others have said, lots of free stuff and I don't feel pressured to purchase anything at all.",5
"One of the best gatcha games I have ever played, and this is coming from a ptp whale. I ended up spenting over $1k in Puzzles and Dragons and it didn't give me 1/10 of the enjoyment Dragalia had given me. The developers are one of the most generous in the market. Truly feels like they want to make a great game instead of building a cash cow. 10/10 would recommend.",5
Great game! Brings the best of premium games together!,5
Didnt get anything when I bought the beginners pack,2
Friend got me into this game about a week ago and I've legit been sitting here playing it for the past 2 days instead of smash ultimate. There's so much to do and they're so generous with the stamina that you hardly ever run out. You can tell a lot of effort was put into making this game. Only bummer is summoning rarely tends to give you anything good. Did 8 tenfold summons and got nothing worthwhile which low-key bummed me out.,5
I have one thing to say if you make it connect to Google play games you should make it remember the stuff you had I will never play this game again I played at release stopped playing for a bit went back and it had non e of my data saved all cause I didn't link it to Nintendo first. Horrible.,3
"Cool, but it needs a way to farm summons.",3
"I have two major issues with Dragalia Lost. The first is the initial experience, after playing through a short demo the app needs to download over 5gb of data, but you cannot put the app in the background or no progress is made. My second is there is just way too much going on with currencies, upgrade items, summons, dragons, abilities, upgrades, character advancement, and a typical upgrading land plots with its own currency and upgrades to manage all for a drag and tap RPG.",3
Great game overall with afew downsides! 1st getting new adventures is a important part of the game so there should be a free daily summon period. 2nd is the lack of communication as there is no chatting with party members & you cannot remove any players. 3rd issue i have with the game is the sudden difficulty with Advance dragon trials expert! U need certain adventures to fit the stage & the dmg is insane. We should be able to get experts items through the weekly bonus for a F2P friendly game!,4
super cool game. the graphics and story are really good. the controls are decent. overall a must play game,5
"I mean, it's ok. It's got the level of polish you would expect from nintendo, but it's still just a gatcha based phone game.",4
"1st, Cygames runs the show here not Nintendo, so don't fear the micro transactions. Cygames is very generous! An RPG with co-op, great story, great characters and unique gameplay to most in the mobile genre. The only bug I've come across is some minor server instability at times but I've never lost even a byte of data due to that. Across the board graphics, sound, gameplay, funfactor, it's 5*'s all the way!",5
This game actually has so much content im surprised its free. I seear the devs r so generous if they ever go bankrupt its cause they gave everyone a full refund for every micro transaction randomly.,5
Great,5
"Good content, good story, and most importantly it ISNT pay to win like most mobile rpg grinds are. Love the characters and the classic anime storyline. (Would make a great tv series!) There could be some balancing with team power vs content, ran into issues of 13-15k team having trouble running 7k powered content even with 5* team/dragons/healer and max gear/stats for level. That seems very unbalanced to me. Team power should accurately reflect the content it is able to clear.",5
Casual,5
Diefu for waifu,5
"Loads of stuff to do, and you don't have to buy anything.",5
"I love how on the beginning they give u a lot of ""required material"" in the game in order to prosper with ease. It's honestly something great for those newbies who r interested. My only concern is what u receive AFTER the BEGINNING where (some) material is somewhat hard to come across.",4
Not too shabby for a gacha game,4
"Very f2p friendly, good voice acting, somewhat good story. Great gameplay, graphics are unique and wonderful artworks.",5
"This game allows me and my friends play together and we never bored from it. The team is doing really great, there are quite a lot of stories, however, every players should respect and appreciate that! The stories are fun! And I can recive gems after that~ yeah! I have been playing over a year and hope Dragalia Lost could get more and more support, Great Game :)",5
Love this game,5
It's an upbeat and beautiful game that may be grindy and too big but it's one of the most f2p friendly game that is very friendly to new player's. Power creep is a concern but they will soon introduce an update that reruns previous events. So don't worry and play the game and enjoy ^^.,5
The events are repetitive but the story is nice and the graphics are beautiful. The biggest issue is the gigantic download space needed! How stupid is a 5g mobile game?,4
"Honestly best gacha game I've ever played! Amazing storyline (both event and actual story), cute/cool character designs, and the company listens to its players! Recomend for everyone! Though, fair warning, late game is a bit rough and the game is a bit of a grind, but its worth ♡",5
I really am enjoying Dragalia Lost so far I have been getting pretty lucky on summons too so that's a plus. Update: JERKY MOVEMENT IS NO MORE!,5
"really cool game, generous gacha system and simple controls!",5
great game,5
"Terrible design, do not ever play this game. Extremely unsatisfying, repetitive gameplay and predatory business model.",1
I'm giving it a 2 star because in the summoning I only get the dragons like only them and when it comes to characters I rarely do like even my brother who played the game later on is getting characters in one go while I struggle to get one so yeah it good but the rate of the summoning is difficult to increase like I wish I could give a five star but it is just the summoning and its mostly on every event so yeah 😢😢,2
Awesome!need to update the graphics but Awsome none the less,5
Very fun game and nice music to go along with it!,5
Would be great if there's an option to autohide the status bar for more immersive gameplay.,3
Excellent game,5
"Amazing game, very good management",5
I may have just ben an idiot when I posted that because shortly after I was able to play. So heres 5 stars to say Im sorry.,5
One of the best if not The Best mobile game. 100% worth your time. (:,5
"It's the perfect mobile gatcha game. Better than DBZ, fire emblem heroes, gundam, brown dust, pokemon masters. A must play for everyone.",5
"Good music, high quality game.",5
Noce,5
The most generous gacha game I have ever played. You can tell the developers listen and try to make the game better for players instead of feeding on greed. There's a lot of stuff to do and 4 star adventures are viable. Try it out just to see how it is but I'm sure if you like dungeon crawlers then you'd like this game.,5
"What is it with games refusing to connect to servers via wifi, persisting with cellular data instead? Fail. Expected better from Nintendo. Uninstall.",1
This game has always been my favorite mobile game. I can't wait until the rest of the original story gets finished.,5
OOF YASSSSS,5
Good,5
Fun,5
"It's Fun, but the feature to creating a room is not available on my android. This is frustrating as it would be easier to create a room than joining one since they fill up so quickly that you can hardly join any. Hope it gets fixed as i have tried all their recommended solutions.",4
Nice,5
"The developers did a great job with game. The english voice acting is great but, I prefer the japanese voice acting better. Good story and art as well. The game doesn't require you to buy wyrmite and other materials but, they offer some pretty good deals. The art is good as well. The weapon, wyrmprint, and dragon system is great. You can build your castle with tons of facilities to buff your adventures to make them stronger! Its a great game to help pass the time or play with friends.",4
This one of the best games i've ever played.,5
Good,5
I started playing this because of my friend but i kinda like it now the game is a bit laggy for my phone but its tolerable,5
Fair play experience with a good story,5
Rates are legit terrible. Games good but don't expect any sort of leniency when boss power creepy skyrockets.,4
The only game where free players can really enjoy :),5
Great game.. i like the songs.. and the developer listen to our issues..,5
Mym,5
Love it! Need chapter 11,5
Really great so far the pack prices are too high and I have to take a star away for the pay to win aspect of the game Nintendo really let me down on this one. but everything else is really high quality the controls take getting used to but it's a mobile game you can't expect much,4
😎 🤫,5
"Great improvements but still the glarring issue with facility grind, tough for new/retyrning players to stay/be relevant on end game content",4
"What can I say, Nintendo rarely disappoints. Give it a shot.",5
I love this game since the day I started it. I just wish sometimes that the difficulty level were more accurate with the suggestion they made and more gradual...Other then that perfect game !,5
Awesome bgm,5
Nintendo niceee,5
"1st anniversary just rolled by and I'm loving the game, been playing since around release ✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧",5
"This is one of my favorite games, there's always ways to get new characters for free.",5
Changed to five stars because the team has made a lot of amazing improvements.,5
"very low draw rates. greedy gatcha. poor, boring combat. 2 stars for the production value, too bad the gameplay doesnt stand up.",5
This would be a better Nintendo Switch game,3
I really enjoy this game. Love the dialogue and the characters interactions. There could be more clear instructions at times. There is a lot of stuff to collect and the building area is lacking available items. Love this ❤️ game.,5
"Good game, i have better luck in this game then i have in any other gatcha game out there",5
Seems to be a great game but i barely have memory on my phone as it is and this takes up almost 4 gbs thats just crazy please try to make smaller...,2
Great game really generous gacha system would definitely recommend to try out,5
"Bright, very fun and always improving! Dragalia Lost isn's just one of my favorite Mobile Games, it's one of my favorite games.",5
It's fun to play,5
Another great game from cygames. And Nintendo too,5
Absolutely adore this game. Good story and art style. Amazing music and game style. The characters are amazingly well written and varied.,5
Edit: After playing for a year I can definitely say that this game is very good. Not only is it fun it's also very generous to f2p players but also gives great choices for p2p players. The staff is also constantly working improving the game which you can feel with every upcoming update. Thanks to the hard work I'm still here and there is still no sight of me stopping.,5
Good. Can't beat Alberius though,4
The best F2P mobile game I've ever played.,5
"game isnt bad by any means its fun, but the rates are so bad. you pull on a banner for new hero and WILL pull some random wyrm or old hero. Edit. Still just random every banner I get leg an it's old or dupe no matter how much I save or focus on 1. Just done",1
Dope,5
dope,5
this game is great! love the art style and heart thats put into this game. im having a good time,4
Over a year of playing this the update made it better,5
Battery burner. Hope you are playing on an emulator,4
Very fun gacha game with nice graphics and story. They have added a lot of new progression to the game!,5
"This game is very F2P friendly. The devs are very generous with rewards and the cash shop is filled with optional timesavers. My only gripe is that there are banners featuring limited adventurers and dragons that can be very demotivating if you miss out on them. They do reruns of limited units, but it'd be nice if there was a system to obtain a featured unit guaranteed if someone invested enough into a banner.",5
Good,5
"Many cute, well endowed waifus. Need I say more?",5
"A lot of what plagued the game in the beginning has been fixed. There's some hard grinding that you'll need to do to get to endgame, but tolerance for grinding is different per person. I think it's a little much - which is why I'm changing my 3* and giving it 4*.",4
cannot get game to download extra data to sd card,4
"I enjoy the game , the game have have a very improve perfomance and all characters and events i love it, i always have fun",5
"Godly pull rates, amazing characters, and hopefully more amazing collabs thanks for the amazingness",5
Awesome game,5
"Great graphics, great idea. They listened to the player base and fixed a lot of the things people had issues with. This game is worth your time.",5
Awesome,5
Very fair game that actively responds to player base!,5
I love this game so much! I love that you don't have to pay to win or rely on microtransactions. The game is very generous to it's players & there's always new events. 😊❤️,5
Good game :/,5
Best game ever,5
I started and once i got to the download after the tutorial and then it stopped loading. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!,1
Super good game,5
Playing till the day I die or it does,5
"Decent so far. Still has glitches and bugs, but it's a Solid Game.",5
"Has many grade S+ waifus, and has better graphics than the new pokemon game. What more could you ask for",5
OK,5
"forced coop in daily quest is big minus point,too many downloading game data downloading instance, in 1 day you they could update the game up to 2-4 times, what in the world are they updating we dont know. Now about the gameplay, the control is damn awful, the delay in ranged char is so awful, dodging also feel clunky. The story is also not interesting at all.",1
"Solid game so far, very generous.",5
My friend recommended this game to me and let me just say that this is not a bad game at all just the download speed for the whole(at least for me)is slow but other than that it's a good game to play on the road,5
"Great movie game that doesn't really tempt you to throw money at it, though sadly the option is available.",5
"No background downloading for updates. I'm not going to listen to a looped song for a 1 GB update. Even on wifi that would take 20 minutes for me at the rate it was downloading. If there's an option for this, I'll update my review. But for now I'll just play another nintendo mobile game to pass time.",2
Goodd,5
Fun mobile game with endgame content,5
Game crashes after each quest =(,1
I have been enjoying this game very much and I am very glad to see it turning into what it is. Excellent choice.,5
"It's okay, I get to play with friends. But there's so much grind, and way too much stuff you need to collect. Levelling up everything requires entirely different items, there are well over 100 items you need to grind for and upgrading is expensive. High level people will often ditch you in the middle of raids, don't expect people to be friendly.",3
Kiiiinda stupid how they manage the saves... And how you can't sign in at the main menu. Other than that it's relatively grindy,3
My favourite mobile game that I've played so far.,5
balanced gacha game that you can having fun by reaching high ranking with given adventurer. You don't need IAP but still capable to complete all the activities.,5
"Been playing since the first or second week, still a fantastic game to play.",5
Fun game with generous developers for F2P players,5
One of the best and most generous mobile games I've ever played.,5
Awesome,5
The balance of gala Cleo is so messy.,4
Best mobiile game. On Earth.,5
Love the game. But please fix the Halidom achievements.,5
Not bad for a mobile game.,2
"Fun game, impressive for a mobile gacha",5
"I bought new phone, I spend a lot of time on my old one and after that I have lost my progress. Nintendo account was exactly same...",1
Very beautiful and in-depth game :),4
Fun game people may say it's a pay to win it's really not. I got loads of gems in my first playthrough got an immediate 5 star and after that got loads of good characters and items I'm stacked so far. love the game and gonna keep playing it for many more,5
Very fun and keeps you busy!,5
Connection lost during opening of the game.,1
This game has come a long way since its release.,5
"Wow! This is the most spectacularly done RPG of this type. Fantastic graphics (both in combat and even during the storyline). Wide variety of characters, dragons, skills, weapons, ingredients, etc to manage (lots to do), plus an idle farm/decorating element where you build things to empower your fighters. Great voice acting!!! Never feels too corny (like most mobile-RPG dialogue, I feel). Combat is AWESOME, exciting, versatile, and you get to fight as dragons too. 5 STARS.",5
"Tbh I've played a lot of games and this has to be one of the best in my opinion, there are so many lavaling up mechanics so you can continuously get stronger and the bosses r fun to fight and once you go against high level bosses you actually have to have a startegy. Combine all this with playing with friends and it's just an awesome experience, i highly recommend this game or to at least give it a try",5
"Id rate it a 5 just for its story alone but its also based around not paying for things. Its almost incentiviced to not pay for things because of how much you can get done without spending anything. Its very enjoyable to play and takes skill at higher levels. Phenomenal game, 6/5.",5
"It's quite fun, even if it feels like a handful sometimes.",4
Best game ever I play before,5
"Gameplay had been fun and casual when I started few months ago. Devs were generous with gifts. Only problem started with new content of higher difficulty dragons, not easy to find good players to team up with my not so great units. Only enjoying low level contents now.",1
"Great game, very fun! Free to play is good!!",5
Best gacha game ever! Very generous with wyrmite♥️,5
Very exciting and the storyline is good bot the movement controls are not comfortable to use but I could get used to it hehehehe,5
"Good story, funny characters, but I feel like the gameplay is a little sluggish and the gacha chances are kinda ridiculous on how you have a .05 chance of getting a 5 star character, dragon, or wyrmprint. Also, I feel like some of the events are made for people who play 24/7 which can also be really annoying when you have to do a event level that is just spiked in difficulty",4
Been playing since release last year. New director is mentally retarded . Dead game soon,1
"Overall really good game. Summon rates are good and you getting quite a lot of free currency. The downside is low rate of banner units, after more 200 summons I still didn't get main unit from Halloween banner Mym. For example Epic seven has one of best summon systems.",4
"I really love this game, especially the way they introduced everything, with the characters I enjoy reading their interactions with one another, defiently seen as wholesome. Besides from that, the story is engaging, though one thing I suggest is that you add Trading, though in order to unlock trading you'll need to beat Chapter 6, the system can be simple you can trade two stuff over however you can only use trading twice before having to wait a 24 hour period: you could make: Trading Tuesdays.",5
"Exceptionally high production quality and great gameplay elevate this game far and above the general Gatcha trash plaguing the Japanese mobile landscape. A game that deserves the Nintendo Seal of Quality, This is Gatcha done right. Also, dragons. :)",5
"I absolutely love dragons! And if you are too, then I'd happily suggest downloading this game. It's a blast!",5
Not bad,4
Song makes me want to dance,5
A very generous gacha game,5
Best game ever!!! Extremely free to play and devs are generous with events and freebies.,5
Gg,5
"I loved this game but it was linked to my googleplay account but after upgrading my phone it would not link again and nintendo refuses to recover unless you know exactly what lvl your castle was, exactly how much gold and gems you had, which characters you had at lvl 100, a meticulously specific amount of detail that no one would recall or write down, does anyone keep a running total of your currency and levels?",2
I've just started a few days ago and I've been having a good time playing this game so far,5
Actually pretty fun to play. I really like the dragon models,5
One of the only gacha games with fun and addictive gameplay. Wonderful character design and very generous with summons. Frequent events and creating weapons is very enjoyable. One of the best Gacha games ever!,5
"Like it so far, seems generous for a gatcha.Will update once further into the game.",5
Cute cool and fun,5
Very fun :),5
Nice,4
Fantastic game!,5
Great game love the events and how well they incorperated into the story,5
Its fun,5
Nice,5
This game Is phenomenal the graphics are outstanding and the story is so intricate and complex DRAGALIA LOST!! is a must have.,5
Awesome,5
"The game is great, but you're putting too much stuff into it, enough so where nearly everyone has to delete other stuff for more storage.",5
"Lots of free stuff from devs. Not pay to win at all. However, a few items are timegated. But if you are patient, not a problem.",5
The game is fun but it has problems with it's gacha mechanics where the odds doesn't seem to be represented well and the might requirements are not reflected correctly. I have a team of a combine might of over 21'500 yet they keep losing on a mission whose required might is 13'000. What's worse their customers service is terrible to the point where they rather ignore messages rather than being helpful. At least you get ingame currency very quickly. Try it but don't pay for bad service.,3
"Fun game so far, still early in the story",5
Best app ever! Melsa is best girl!,5
Cool game featuring Melodias,5
Cool dragon game,5
"Good, one of the best gacha games.",5
"Okay, im bit a fan of this gatcha game but this one is pretty neat",5
"I have had a pretty fun experience with the game so far, looking forward to more.",5
One of the Best Mobile Games Ever Made. Period.,5
"後期的天花板太高,有課都不可達到",1
Continuous QOL improvements,4
"A fairly addicting game. I like the characters too. A pretty good RPG, in my opinion one of the coolest and interesting RPG game apps out there. Looking forward to more updates in the future.",4
The gameplay is great and the story feels well thought I think this is a great game.,5
Addictive game with lots of characters and customization,5
"Pretty cool, I'm just starting out so the combat areas are alittle short. I hope they get bigger and longer as the game progresses.",4
awful experience after 1st anniversary,1
"Fun characters, cute art style, and very generous for a free-to-play game.",5
It's pretty good,5
"The game is quite fun, but it takes up WAY too much storage space. Currently, it takes up 3.06 GB. That is a huge turn off when other Nintendo mobile games are just as fun, but take way less space.",3
"Very interactive, lots of things to do.",5
The game is fun but its hugly divided when co op becomes a facter the req might is very poitless if it cant give you even a glimps of a win especaly with ppl just quitting do to not bringing there total might up even tho your already past the req but its not 100% there fault but development for even giving req of might no point just get rid of it to give more ppl less issue with it being there with very little value. Also the npc need a bit more value to life then what they have,3
"Another great games from cygames. Since it is a Nintendo games, quality is top of the lines for android. Very generous for the current standard. And ots and lots of content, with many hours of grinding. However, keeping the automation to be played idle making it a good side and main game. Some of the best coop games in the market right now.",5
Great game with tons of free items not entirely p2w,5
"Amazing gameplay, beautiful story, and it's even better than Rune Story for almost everything. I'm glad I played this magnificent game like this.",5
Fun and not p2w,4
"Fun game if you play it with a friend. End game gets grindy and un-fun solo and usually requires at least two 30 min play sessions to use up resources. If solo, just play through the story and stop when end game starts feeling repetitive.",4
"I don't like that ever chapter is a download. My memory won't hold it cause I also have other games, but I could not enjoy this one.",2
Its good,5
Fun,5
"Very fun, heartwarming mobile rpg. It is more casual than Gatcha based, easy to get some of the units.",5
"The game play, the story-line, the animation...all of it is so brilliant. Its an awesome game and I love every second of it. It's a big game but definitely worth its gb, so definitely have some space on your phone for it.",5
ok,5
"While I love this game to bits and want to support the devs, I am continuously disappointed by the team not doing anything about the lack of character variety in end game. 3 out of 5 high end bosses have a community requirement of 2-3 units when so many good units exist and it's because the devs developed those units to be overpowered. There is nothing to prevent people from locking out players with off meta units who play well or know the fights.",1
Connection error won't let me get passed title screen,1
"Really fun, easy to pick up and play. Also has the depth of an rpg while keeping it fun. I am enjoying this game so far",5
"Great story, great graphics! Really fun gameplay!",5
Not bad so far,5
Very fun game,5
Fun game,4
"Very good game, when Nintendo made this new IP i was hesitant about it at first, but soon as i started playing, i fell in love with it, and i spent hours upon hours lost in it's wonderful world, very recommended.",5
"I accidentally re posted my review... so a year ago my game broke itself. It soft locked me on the co op create party screen. After resetting the game, it brings me to the quest screen, not allowing me to click any buttons except the ones leading to the create party screen. Once there, it forced me to click the create party button. I waited 4 hours and the game didnt finish loading. Other than that the game is fine. I had full bars the whole time and I am using a samsung s8.",1
fun,5
"Such a fun game to play when your chilling, after a good smokal 10/10",5
I've played dozens of mobile games and this is the first time that is truly a fun game as opposed to a good time waster. Game is super generous to free players and really doesn't need any money. Its just a dang good time.,5
"Game can be fun, but don't expect to be able to clear their harder content as is locked behind you drawing the right gatcha characters.",2
: ^),5
Fun game,5
Nice lo,5
It's one of the best F2P games out there. They made it really easy for you to level up and summon high stat adventures and dragons without breaking the bank.,5
Loved it but it was too big for my phone...,5
Beautiful game & world with amazing characters & story also! Can be a bit different in the controls for some I would imagine. But even I was amazed at how smooth it can be! Very F2P friendly (probably the one of the better experiences I have had with a mobile phone game!) Give it a go folks!,5
Great but I can't transfer my progress to another device please help,4
"The game's presentation and graphics are excellent. The simplified controls are great as well. I doubt I will spend money on this game but i'm willing to keep playing. I really like some of the characters and to mu surprise, the game has english voice acting too!",4
"All that work and you put a ""auto play"" button in the game. What's even the point of playing?",2
Super excited for more content great gameplay with friends a perfect game to kill time and make bonds.,5
"**Missing PVP content** Love it, but I think it will be more challenging if we had some pvp content and more content for alliances.",4
"Extremely generous gacha, very active and fun gameplay. Multiple combat mechanics make it more than a tapfest. Characters are fleshed out and interesting. Events shake things up every few weeks. Highly recommend. EDIT: One year later and its still just as good.",5
It's a really fun game with great graphics and gameplay. I enjoy the combat mechanics as they're not clunky like most games like this.,5
"F2P where grinding and farming is an essential trait to progress upwards! Graphics, soundtracks and gameplay is magnificently made. Definitely recommend!",5
Fun so far. Odds for 5* characters look pretty low but we will see. Hopefully i pick a few up to keep me jnterested. Nothing worse than bad rng in a gacha game.,5
Good,5
是一個音樂和動畫都很棒的遊戲 我覺得和白貓很像 但是白貓沒有中文的 所以我覺得不太會看日文的可以玩玩看,5
Fun. Treat for killing time.,4
Great game. Love the characters and story.,5
Fun,4
Best game ever played,5
This game is amazing! Nintendo did a good,5
It good,5
Pretty dang amazing,5
This goes down to 1 star if I don't get Halloween Elisanne,4
"It's been a year now and I thought I'd update my review. Honestly one of the best mobiles games I've played. The Dragalia Lost team is great, they communicate, gift the players often and put effort and love in the game. After the one year anniversary, I'm excited for what's in store!",5
"Gameplay is the funnest I have encountered in a while and I think if you were there for the long haul it's super f2p friendly but good luck getting a group for higher level content, fights can be very unforgiving and most high level players won't waste their time if you aren't overskilled.",4
Dog game,1
"Ive been playing this game for the whole year, i really enjoy the storyline it has a Breath of Fire feel to it, but a different and very well told storyline. Constant updates and additional Summons makes you want to play more and more which in turn you also gain materials to upgrade things. The Devs listen to the players and add shortcuts and try to make the grind not so arduous. I seriously love the game and can see it getter better and better.",5
Great,5
Absolutely awesome game love it.,5
Best game ever made.,5
Fun game. Daoko is anazing! Drains the phone's battery like crazy!,4
"Lots of fun!, smooth animation and a cute if old hat RPG plot make it alot of fun",5
Very good gotcha,5
Keep up the great work nintendo! Great little RPG with super simple controls.,5
"This game is sooo fun to play. It's the most generous gacha like game that I've ever played, but that doesn't mean it's easy. It's still a tough grind to get good enough to access some of the later content, but it's very worth it in my opinion. It's also very fun to play in co op. It does take up a lot of space though, but other than that, it's well worth it.",5
So far so good,4
"Solid game right off the bat. Great gatcha game with little pressure on premium purchases. Voice acting is pretty good, game runs and looks great. The gameplay is quite fun overall to boot.",5
Best,5
"Wonderful in every aspect, story, ost, characters, fairness, free content ... After one year playing I hope I can keep playing for a long time.",5
Super fun game. Needs better reates though kn gacha.,5
"This is exactly the kind of game I've been looking for. It's a fun, immersive JRPG. Just enough classic touches to make it nostalgic, but with enough modern ideas to keep it relevant. I fully intend on recommending this game to others.",5
One of the best F2P friendly gachas I've played.,5
This game is dying with bad story and bad number system.,1
"Very high quality game. You can tell the devs put a lot of love into the base gameplay. I'm not sure if it's my cup of tea quite yet as I'm very early in the story so I don't know how later fights will go, but I'm enjoying it. Cygames is known for the love they put in.",5
"The game was good,(i only played the tutorial,sooo...yeah)but i had to delete it for more space sadly,its s good game never the less",4
"As expected, a great mobile RPG. Cute stylised art style and great gameplay.",5
"really fun, gacha rates are boosted for gala summoning. Music by Daoko is toptier.",5
"Great game! Cygames never fails at being generous in their gacha games, lots of free gems, free pulls, and a lot of way to get more, and their daily discount draw is amazing too. Gameplay is solid, and music by DAOKO, and cute character designs by Naoki Saito, what's not to love?",5
"honestly one of the best and fairest gacha games I've ever played. incredibly generous, adorable characters, and fun gameplay.",5
Great gameplay! This feels like a friendly F2P game and is challenging! Always has events and new updates!,5
Great,5
"I absolutely love this game, it isn't like a lot of other gachas that almost force you to not be free to play, but so far I haven't paid a single cent and I am extremely far in the game. They give a lot of summoning materials and a lot of units are usable for big fights in the end game so it's not super exclusive. One gripe I do have with the game is that the cast of summonable units keeps increasing with with each banner, so it is a bit harder to get specific units that you want. 10/10 game tho",5
"Game has been improved a lot over the time and it's become of my favorites with new stuff being added in a good pace. Devs have been super generous all the time and constantly fixing any problems, often compensating the players. The character pool has become really big and summoning system became better without wyrmprints although the powercreep seems to be more explicit lately. Since the game runs 3d models it's expected a good smartphone to run this smoothly.",4
Pretty good! Controls are a bit weird though but that's it.,4
"Played back then, got back into it. Fun fun fun",5
good graphics and storyline and cute side storys and good characters and a very good support group that are fast at helping get your problems fixed,5
Generous game,5
"It's really good, and its getting better and better.",5
"Music in this game is Fire, Storyline pace is perfect, Character animation is lite, it's the perfect TRPG and tops the new mario kart mobile that just released.",5
🔥🔥,5
"I just enjoy the game, quite simple and yet a nice story to go along with",5
it's a fun game. I like the designs and battle styles,5
I would like this game a lot better if there wasn't so much free stuff constantly being awarded for doing nothing but logging in. It makes it hard to enjoy the game.,3
Fun as hell,5
Cool,4
"This is a very cute game, with soundtracks by DAOKO, I highly recommend it to any Japanese loving weeb.",5
Amazing,5
i like it,5
The developers are so generous. Game never gets boring and is always improving for the better. Story is great with lovable characters. I can't reccomend this game enough. Please play Dragalia Lost.,5
Solid,5
Love cleo,5
"The game is fun for a few days, week tops. No need to spend real money on it, which is a plus. You blow through normal and hard mode on the main quest line in no time... then you just look at it wondering what the heck you do next. You end up left feeling like there is nothing else to truly accomplish. There is so much room for more in this that it kinda makes me sad it's not there. Alliance is about pointless, nothing there except chat and a daily login bonus. Add more late game content please.",2
Amazing game. No tricks to spend money. Definitely not pay 2 win. Community is great and devs do loads of events a freebies. But most importantly...BOOM,5
Daoko alone,5
The gameplay and story are really fun. The graphics and animation are also good. Overall a pretty fun game so far.,4
Can get repititive,4
"So far it's awesome, hoping I don't hit a pay wall. Beautiful game and the music is great.",5
Too complex for new casuals,2
Songs are all bangers every thing is cute and colorful 100/10,5
Its an amazing game im a youtuber hit me up EzekielGames/music,5
"The story is suffisticated enough for me to show curiousity for what happens next. The combat is simple, yet satisfying. Character variety is there and it doesnt lack originality. As a nintendo game, this game manages to create heart warming experience, making me care even more for the characters and the story that is quite well writen. And the voice acting is probably one of the main reasons for me to play this game, the voice acting quality compares to anime, it isnt cheap and emotionless.",5
I'm just a noob here leveling up and looking forward to Mega Man colab,5
KAWAIIIIII,5
"Easy to learn and fun to play! Im glad my friends told me about this game, what with the anniversary and all.",4
Fun.. a bit slow but fun.. I only got for when megaman joins,5
It's just awesome. This game has everything you need to enjoy playing a rol game.,5
"Pretty funny game, the Devs got a good balance of in game purchases: you can purchase extra content but you have no need for purchases in order to advance in the main story",5
This game is amazing.,5
Pretty good so far,4
WAHOO,5
1st anniversary was incredibly generous and very fun!,5
"A really great action RPG which features a generous gacha system, beautiful graphics, and fun gameplay.",5
Great game and the tech staff are incredibly helpful,5
Good game,4
The audio is not working is quite well as it should,4
Good,5
It good,5
Still figuring things out but it looks cool… also think it would be better to have separate controls for movement and attack,4
I love the voice acting in the game and the music is cheerful! The dragons are really amazing I love the design on them ♡ 😁,5
Very fun game but I'm kinda confused with the heroes and dragon needs a better tutorial,5
This is one of the best MMORPG for Android that is FREE TO PLAY. honesty I'd rather play this than play an MMORPG on PC . Trust me if anyone reads this play this game download all the game data at once and play the game. This game will make you satisfied with life. Plz take this into consideration when downloading. If there's a bad review on this game it's fake. This game is amazing.,5
Cant stop playing 😂😂😎,5
Good,5
Nice.,5
Fun game. Also Daoko is awesome.,5
"I have rather enjoyed playing this game, but it would be better if it let me use my stylus( I play on a samsung note 9)",4
It won't open on my phone,1
"I'm editing my review, the co-op is indeed fixed as far as I'm aware, however, the microtransactions are a little... broken. The prices aren't what in worried about, it's the fact that you can't access them is the big problem, they don't work so well. Other than that, great game, super fun to play, and with co-op fixed, I can give it a better review.",5
Love it!,5
Loving the game so far. Super cute style,5
I like how the story is going so far and im impressed with how easy it is as well as how easy it is to navigate the hud.,5
"Very fun , overall,",5
The story is perfect,5
Good so far,5
Fun,5
すごい！！,5
Quality devs. Game has a lot of support and development. Really enjoyed the anniversary event.,5
"This is a great game, but God help you if you uninstall to take a break and try to come back. If you accidentally didn't link it to a Nintendo account they're not going to let you restore your save data, even if you made in-app purchases and can provide receipts for every purchase. They require extremely detailed in game info as ""proof"", things like facility level, might value of strongest team, etc., that most people aren't going to remember months later. Purchases aren't proof, apparently.",1
"Great game, lovely gameplay and impressive RNG rates.",5
"It is a very good game, but I personally think it is not worth 3 GB.",4
"The music, art and story are really the only thing this game has going for it.(only reason it's not a one) The game plays itself for the most part, past that it is grinding. To max out a character you'll need about 500 lvl up items and bunch of random drops! To max out a dragon you'll you need 5 of the same random rare draw and 500 dragon lvl up items To max out a weapon you'll need to play at least 3 lvls 200x each to get the necessary drops(fingers crossed)",2
Why does this game takes ages to download. it did finsh but like in a few minutes it asked for 3.09 GB not pay to play more like a year to play. there is too much stuff in this game. Uninstalling.,1
I got lost in a Dragon,5
"Good devs and game systems, but I felt gameplay was too grindy and repetitive, and characters all felt the same to play as those with the same weapon have the same animations, and also every character only has one artwork. Didn't really connect with any of the characters or story either, and gacha summoning wasn't enjoyable, especially with dupes. Got a bit bored of it so I stopped after starting from day 1 and playing for about half a year.",2
This game has been amazing i just started not too long ago and cant put the game down,5
"Phenomenal game, with fantastic developers.",5
Not recieving my ten voucher draw daily from event,1
The game is really good and if they keep going at this rate I think that this game will be the best Nintendo mobile game ever so I give it a 6/10 and you should play if you like just destroying everything in your path,1
Amazing,5
To discribe how it feels to play this game: Y E S E N S L A V E D D R A G O N,5
Games great just wish it wasn't so much of a space taker on my phone,3
Fun game so far and rich gameplay,5
Simply put it's a very fun rpg's that you should definitely give a shot if you like RPGs dragons and gatcha waifus.,5
The co-op could use some work.,4
So much fun! Can't wait to see the future development of this game!!,5
Most user-friendly mobile game to play.,5
Games ok. drop rate is garbage,3
Worst customer service ive ever seen im my life,1
Screw Stamina !,5
Good,5
This game is awesome is awesome easy control cool graphics and the dragons cool but I know what could be even better you know in the beginning of the game you get to be elysium for a short time how about adding him to the game being part of the team a dragon who has all the elements and could have an animation when he is using his special that could be awesome like so the creators could see and hope they could make it happen,5
Good time waster,5
"Great Game, Crash and Lags Occasionally. Got into it during this Anniversary event and really enjoyed it. I noticed the game lagging a bit while playing so I lowered quality for performance. Still occasionally lags and the future event does not let me do raids a few days in. I either crash after joining a party or endless loading. Idk why but i managed to play in raids for the first day and now i cant. Also very hefty app. About 5 gb is a lot for me but it does look like it has a lot of content.",3
This game is the only thing I look forward to in life.,5
Fun game with lots of love put into it.,5
Awesome story with adorable dragons,5
"Is it only me or does the game crash for anyone else? My phone is fine and it has loads of storgage and memory left so I don't understand why it crashes, other than that pretty fun and decent game.",3
"Just a minute playing and I'm hooked already, good job Cygames ~",5
Nice game.,5
Played since launch and recently came back. The game has changed a lot in recent months and I'm amazed by the changes and updates they implemented. The removal of wyrmprints in the gatcha pool was the most unexpected and welcome change I saw. It made aquiring 5 star adventurers and dragons in this game is VERY forgiving with pity rate and plentiful amounts of free wyrmite. The best part about the game is that they actually listen to player feedback to improve and keep players happy.,5
"Game is too big, huge download",1
It gud,5
A great game,5
This game is really great the more u play it the more u like it n u can get really far with no money has alot to do n nice events also they r always adding new events so it doesnt get boring give it a shot I'm sure u will love it,5
Love it !! Is so fuuuun !!,5
The game is fun overall it have a decent graphic the questline is interesting and your units have the ability to turn to a dragon if u have the dragon card what more you can ask :),5
"Great game, highly recommend!",5
"Honestly, for what I thought it was going to be, it was pretty fun. It's still what I thought, a gacha game with gameplay essentially identical to Pokemon Rumble, but it's fun. One gripe I do have is the helper system. An interesting idea, but I'm forced to choose one, despite the fact I never end up using it and it's just fine if I don't, and then get asked to send a friend request to them. If there was some option to not use helpers or turn off the friend request, it'd be much less annoying.",4
"A game where I actually am enjoying the story. Edit: A year later. I have greatly enjoyed the story and fun character side stories. They just keep adding stuff. Tons of characters. No pay to win stuff. Most of the time I find I have trouble keeping up with the events/my own grinding routine. And events are constant. What more, if luck isn't on your side and you dont roll an event character the roll back around for summoning events. A nice touch. Only mobile game to keep me playing over a year.",5
Cool,5
It gud,5
Very fun! Feels like it's an friend coming to visit and we have a blast together,5
This is a very fun game with great music. My chap phone does not run it very well and this game takes up alot of space so i had to delete it.,5
WHY CANT I LINK LATER? I dont know if I'll like the game????? Bad game. Can't even start it up.,1
"This game is a lot of fun and has a lot of charisma, but I'm concerned about its tendency to stop working. Hope that gets fixed 'cuz I do like this game.",4
"I really enjoyed the actual gameplay, and the 2d artwork, and the events qnd characters and ect, but i think the 3d characters could be less clunky looking, but more importantly, the reason i unistalled, is that you need to download something every other minute. As soon as you complete one quest, you have to download the next. It doesn't run to smoothly on my phone, and for all the storage it uses, it isn't worth it to me. If the downloading thing was fixed, and some characters 3d art was redone, id totally come back and play again.",3
"Beautiful game! I love the graphics! This is totally deserves a 5 star review. The music, characters, voices, art...It's all wonderful. The possibilities are endless! When it comes to mixing and matching your team, upgrading your characters, and battling a boss, this game has it all. Everything about it screams cutsie but at the same time, very epic and enthralling! I don't usually enjoy mobile games much but this one has definitely changed my mind. I definitely recommend playing this game.",5
Download it and try it out for yourself.,5
I love it,5
Awsome game I love it,5
Is awsome yall should try it,5
Insanely fun and allows you to experience a beautiful world of adventure alongside your friends! Plenty of opportunity to upgrade and enhance the characters you utilize too!,5
Well made game in a 3D fantasy realm. Gameplay is well conceived. Use of resources and gems is balanced. I do worry that the graphics are too taxing for my smartphone.,4
Kinda hard to learn but once you get it super fun,4
Best mobile game by far! :-D,5
Amazing story line and cute animation for the characters 👌🏼👌🏼,5
It's a pretty good,4
I've put about a year into this game now and it's a solid game. The story is interesting enough to be good for a mobile game which is rare IMHO. The characters are interesting and likeable. The mechanics are solid and the Gacha is the nicest Gacha ever at least for me. Highly recommend this game to any looking for something really good in a mobile game. The only complaint I ever had which has improved greatly since this games release is the team AI.,5
"A decent take on the action rpg mobile game. Still need to get used to the controls, but enjoyable.",4
Nintendo please add link as a character,5
"The music is phenomenal, and so far it's been very easy to just jump in and start having fun! Will update as needed.",5
Fun,4
Ummm I summoned gala Euden on the free ten fold so yeah 5 stars I guess.,5
Its probably the best rpg youre gonna find on mobile devices thats not pay to win,5
I've turned off notifications yet still get annoying push notifications constantly.,1
This game amazing the graphics the Adventure the charaters & and gameplay all too perfect this is one of mu favorite app game so far,5
Great,5
Error code 106 from recent patch. Can no longer play this game on Xperia XZ Premium.,1
Great game,5
pls unbanned emulator the game is pretty good,5
"I'm updating my old review, from 3stars to 4stars. Game has dramatically improved since launch. Just a couple minor problems. There is zero point in rolling on seasonal versions of your favorite characters since you can't use them at the same time as the original you've already invested in, this has made some of my ""luckiest"" rolls feel like a slap in the face rather then a joyous occasion. A game mode to use more of our rosters would be nice, 110 characters and no reason to level 90 of them.",4
"Love it. Another fun game by Nintendo! Very good effort done by the team on characters, story, events and I was also impressed they even did a COMIC GUIDE for users. It was engaging and funny. Good thought put into it. I enjoy the gacha system. Even if you get duplicates, you get useful Eldwater which is necessary for promotion of characters. There is always something to do in this game; yet it's not a chore at all! Congrats on your anniversary Dragalia!",5
Is this On the nintendo switch?,5
Connection errors continue to make game impossible to play.,1
Fun game,5
Pretty gucci not gonna lie,5
This game is awesome. The best mobile i ever played.,5
This game is really fun!,5
Cant play because I dont have 1tb of memory on my phone so cant download on the 8th download,1
"It's very bad. Terrible portrait view, too much battery drain, can't use emulator. Pricing is very predatory. Avoid.",1
There's so much to this game. The gameplay is excellent and the gacha is the best in any mobile game I've played.,5
Great fun,5
Game is absolutely awesome.,5
A free to play game with actual gameplay. A drop of water in a desert wasteland.,4
Everything's amazing. Easy controls and could be played with a single hand. The only thing whats makes it disappointing is the its huge data file. Takes huge data to download and takrs s lot of space of the phonr which is too unfortunate. I will play once the game is compressed . :),5
This game is very fun highly recommend,5
Amazing and enjoyable games.. The music thé game play is great perhaps the summon rate is kinda bad but the game is great and worth your time,4
You will regret playing this game,1
The game is extremely well done but the only reason I'm not giving it a 5* is because of the content lulls it has occasionally,4
Nicenicenicenicenice,5
It is fun to play than other mobile game,5
Good game,5
"The character design is very nice, the game desigm is pretty good as well",5
Can't even play the game because the downloads are always interrupted by errors.,1
Like it so far.,5
Your game is amazing and it is really fun,5
"Awesome, fun game and you don't have to pay a tremendous amount to make it far.",5
Great game ! My only complaint is that game is VERY heavy.,4
Good game other than intermitent game disconnects,4
"Easy to play, it's a game for players who want to pay to win or people who play for fun and dont spend a dime. Interesting story and great character designs. Fun events also",5
I like it,4
Good gacha system. The dev's make it feel like they care about the user base and about the game.,4
Make the units that look limited being LIMITED. Otherwise cool game,4
Super fun to play.,5
"Stunning and catchy music makes doing things out of combat entertaining, fun gameplay and engaging story.",5
Love the game cool to play with friends,5
One year anniversary. I'm glad I waited. 🤩🤩🤩,5
Very fun!,5
"You monsters. You did it. You actually did it. A game that feels so enjoyable you almost forget that its on mobile. Any plans for a console experience for this franchise? Its too good not to expand on it more... but the monetization is probably tasty, so i wont fault you for not going that route",5
It's been fun so far,4
Great JRPG on the mobile,5
Great game really looking forward to the crossover it will be having soon,5
"This game is great but it takes up to much space on your phone, and it's also vary laggy. Other wise it's not a bad game.",5
"The menus make the game feel so slow, and mobile games dont need slow tutorials!",3
Fun but lack of content,5
"I can't speak highly enough about Dragalia Lost. Updates and events make you feel the devs they play their own game. Gameplay is fun, plenty of opportunities for F2P, catch-ups campaigns, events are well paced, updates added many QoL conveniences, and the story is a bonus. Dragalia Lost sets a very high bar for quality, polish, and player-friendly focus in gacha games. Definitely give it a try! 5 stars does not do the game justice. BOOM!",5
"I love the app, just have an issue with my phone's memory and the size of the download",5
It's definitely a fun game with a nice story to follow. Definitely a game I can stick with.,5
I'm surprised by the quality of the game. I really like how you can play it one handed,5
Cute game with excellent music!,4
Its fun. By the people who make Granblue. I still prefer granblue more but it has more action instead of just RPG,4
"Well polished game. Wonderful graphics, soundtrack, and story. The developers are probably the best I have seen in a mobile game. They take feedback to heart. One year later, and I'm still playing. Game continues to impress.",5
Very entertaining u will enjoy if u like the grind with hackinslash :) with a dash of auto so u can laxly grind what u wish also the in-game crystal's are simple to grind out so not alot of pay to win,5
This game is awesome! It's fun and easy to pick up and play. The story isn't too bad either. Good job devs,5
Borrowing,1
enjoying it!!!,5
Ok this is a weird bug: Everytime I connect to WiFi I can't play the game but with my phone data I totally can. Can u fix this guys?,2
Great game and devs give free stuff often,5
Very well made,5
"Fun gameplay, engaging story and its clear the developers try to make this as free to play as possible as opposed to other companies that just want a quick dollar. Definitely a game worth trying out.",5
good,5
POG,4
Fantastic! I play every single day!,5
Great! Only wish the ui was less cluttered.,5
"I absolutely love Dragalia Lost, but the Auto mode is a nightmare, especially in EX stages. If you allow us the option to choose how Auto works, like avoiding traps, killing all enemies, claiming Dragon crystals to use your dragon, and other stuff like that, I'd give an easy 5 stars. I absolutely love the story, am invested in the characters and lore, but Auto mode is just annoying.",4
"That's what I think of the Gala Draw!! Did 10x 10 fold draws and no Gala characters or any 5* character.... since the rates are lies since the drawing has so much garbage that it will take 600$ just to get a character, Fail event from a greedy company go fig..",2
So far everything has been top-notch!,5
like this is overall good but I took a break do to data usage so where is my old squad,5
Great,4
Start now while the anniversary celebrations are on,5
"Broken app won't work, reinstalled several times and can never get past the initial black screens. Wanted to return to this game for the anniversary but I can't even play.",1
刷起手太久外，其實還好,4
The game fun and highly get the game now with the one year anniversary going on,5
"Been playing since day one and still love it. Devs do a great job of listening to player feedback and have made tons of changes to address the feedback. Content does get repetitive at times but they are always finding new ways to spice things up, even if it's minor changes. Very FTP friendly as I have only spent real money once and yet have many of the strongest units in the game. I have nothing but good things to say about this game. Here's to one year of Dragalia and for the many more to come",5
I lost my game data,1
Swell,5
"Quite the solid game from what I've played so far. Though I have one gripe about it. Outside of the gameplay, the game just won't register me using my Note 9's stylus. If that could somehow be fixed, then I'd say this is a solid 5.",4
"Played this gem since its release, and its been a great ride so far! Although the touch controls are a tiny bit awkward and would probably be more fluid with butttons, the game plays great overall. The stamina/gatherwing system is very forgiving of failed attempts and resources are plentiful. The developers are very responsive to constructive feedback and the fanbase in general. The gacha elements are only really needed for post-main story content, and if you want to roll wyrmite is plentiful!",5
"God do I love this game. It's very addicting, generous, and has a nice story! 10/10 would reccomend!",5
"I just downloaded this game yesterday and so far I'm having a blast! Since the anniversary is going on right now, now is the best time to get into this game as they give you lots of items to get you started in the game. I'm for sure recommending this game to my friends!!",5
Ok,4
"I'm on and off with game. Why can't you download the data when your phone is off holy smokes it seriously takes like 30 minutes to download and you have to be on screen the whole time. LET ME TURN OFF MUSIC SO I CAN LISTEN TO MY OWN AT LEAST, MAN!",3
I find this game very fun and have been playing since day one.,5
Fun,5
Good,5
Fun and,5
I've been playing this game since launch and this game has only gotten better with every update. I'm always logging in to check on what's new or just to enjoy the music and upbeat natures of the characters. This game is great and I really recommend it. Also the game developers are very generous. Free to play is very possible but I'll spend money with the intent to help the delvopers. They listen to feedback and always make quality of life changes to benefit the players.,5
"Its very nice , i hope they have virtual joy stick",5
"So far I'm enjoying myself. I'm not too fond of gacha games, but this one might be the one I might stick with. The gameplay might get me addicted lol",4
"I can't reccomend this game enough! It has a great story and great characters, and it's loads of fun to play. It's very generous to free-to-play players too! The real-time battle system is intuitive and fun. Plus, it has co-op so you can play with your friends.",5
Would play again,5
Amazing,5
"If you're familiar with other Gacha type games, just know that this game is generous. Extremely generous. Oh yeah, it's pretty fun too. If you can spare a few gigabytes of space, definitely worth giving a shot.",5
🤗🤗🤗,5
funfun!!,5
"Such a great game, I don't really get into much mobile games but this tops all of them! I love everything about this game; graphics, music, characters, story, events, co-op and summoning! However, I do have some issues. When I play co-op, the game closes itself down. I play on an Huawei P Smart fig-lx1. I've altered my settings multiple times to see if the problem would stop, but it still keeps doing it. If this could be fixed that would be great! Keep up the amazing work!",5
"After playing this game for ~6 months. I can say that this is one of the most f2p game out there. Dailies take around 30mins if you play through all stages, less you if use skip tickets/2x auto etc. 10/10 will highly recommend.",5
Its a fun game,5
Nice,4
"While the game eats the living hell out of your storage space, It's really fun. It is a gacha game but the good news is that you really don't have to spend no money on and I'll admit, the controls is werid cause it's in portrait mode *like all nintendo mobile games* but it takes some time.",5
"Having lots of fun and the songs are very catchy, love it a lot now is the time to play if u wanted to try with 1st anniversary",5
"Impressive game! It has everything that a RPG should have: action, adventure, magic and amazing battles!",5
"The controls are a little wonky, but the game seems fun so far",4
Fun,5
"The game has left a pleasent feeling to playing! Its smooth and functional and works for lolipop based versions tablet! How ever...it feels a little difficult for me to get control of the combat comtrols...but thats my opnion only, and i just started. But theirs auto combat, which is good. But if ome trys for normal exp without auto play... pratice...alot. thnx 4 the event! Bst time 2 join, thank my friends for getting me to play as well!",4
The game play music and progression is very good.,5
Make America great again,5
Fun and casual game for all F2P and paying players.,5
It doesn't work sometimes and can you guys remove 5 star adventurers duplicates and I get so sad can you remove it please and its so hard to get a new adventurer and when i get a rainbow and i love this game but getting wrimrime takes so long and it's worth it if you get a legendary adventure and void agni and void jenne are too hard agni's movements are random and can't read them and jenne attacks are too fast and hard to move out of an attack,5
Really fun and has cute charcter designs,5
Theres alot to do it's almost like a console level game but on mobile,5
Gg,5
Only played about an hour but enjoying my time alot so far! I really want to see how this story progresses!,5
In love this game especially when ypu can turn into dragons I love being able to do that,5
Seems very free-to-play friendly and music is spot on for the experience. Definitely for those looking to kill a few minutes (or hours).,5
"Lots of fun , awsome adventures to go on, DRAGONSSSSSS :0",4
"Look good, but i hope this game can play offline.",4
I love DAOKO,5
Amazing game takes a while to download but best game on my phone,5
its a good game but it uses so much data,4
Fun little hack and slash,5
Best developers Cygames,5
this game has wonderful controls and a good story (thanks nintendo),4
Very good game and love the artstyle and the certain air around it. I'm not far but I can already tell it gonna be a good story for me to unwrap,5
Game is really awesome wish I played from the beginning but I'm here now!!,5
"Nintendo + Mobile = Greed. I don't mean they are just greedy though. Oh no no. They become the literal embodiment of the sin itself. Also the games they make aren't just cashgrabs they are also trash games. Except FEH. That one was just so restrictive on premium currencies that it was unplayable without paying copious amounts of money. Hey Nintendo, remember when your brand stood for quality? XD Me neither how long has it been?",1
Good time waster.,4
Man it's just so good everything about it I had the game before my other phone broke I'm happy I remembered it,5
I can't believe how polished everything is about this game. It's almost as if it's being made as a console game than anything else.,5
An amazing game. Please keep up the good work & content.,5
"The game is very fun and rewarding, the only problem is the amount of space it takes up",5
Please lower the MTX pricing to allow more purchases. Would love to support the game but pricing is too expensive. Summoning is a big hit or miss as sometimes you'll have great luck but majority time the odds are against you.,4
I started playing this game on realise date and all I had to say then was can't wait to see how far it will go now look at it now,5
"One of the game that care their customer, the gameplay is good, the music is awesome",5
Its cool,5
"Doesn't launch on my Nexus 9 tablet, latest Android 7.1.1, it says ""failed to extract resources needed by II2CPP"".",5
"New Favorite Game! I highly recommend this game, I started playing a few months back and honestly been on it every day. I wish I would have played since day 1 because I missed out on nice events. Hopefully some will repeat. Cough Cough Fire Emblem... Fingers Crossed.",5
A very execellent game!! So far I love the story of the game!!,5
Games fun,5
Awesome dragons for all!,5
Pretty impressed so far. Really fun art direction and I really enjoy how the game play has been designed. Biggest negative so far is how overwhelming it is visually and mechanically from the start. I'd like delve further into the game before making a final judgment.,4
Amazing gameplay,5
"Changing my review. Still a 5 star game. I love this game and plan on investing some money on it evey once in a while. Only criticisms of the game i have is that when i arrived to the catchup quests coming back into it, it needed me to do 5 days of doing all the dailies, but i only had 2 days left on the catchup quest.",5
"Great detail and gameplay, masterpiece among mobile games",5
"Puts the ""game"" in gacha game",5
"This game hekkin fun, 10/10 would force you to play.",5
"Quite fun so far, just started playing today ^-^",4
Best mobile game ever,5
"Best gacha game, gameplay amazing, love the story line. The characters are so beautifully presented",5
"White screen and doesnt load game, it loaded once but couldnt connect to server, i wanted to come back to the game for the aniversary but looks like thats not happening as im gonna miss out on the event days",1
"Rated 1star because the 20mb update through app store is followed by a required 594mb to actually start app, and this isn't the first time.",1
"Only giving it 2* cos the rates are horrible as. That and prices are going to increase soon, cos of the Japanese Tax price increase",2
This game is so much fun that I have it on multiple devices.,5
Like so far and very good game play.,5
Hury for 1 anniversary alot of goodies,5
Great,5
Very good mmorpg,5
Love it,5
Not authorised to play it?? Then why let me download it?? Google Play has the ability to prevent certain devices why don't you use it!?,1
How to link Nintendo account? Always shows process cancelled,4
BEST and I mean BEST mobile game I've ever played! I LOVE Cygames!! PLEASE bring more to the states!!,5
One of the best gacha games out there. A must download. The developers are also really generous and fix issues in the game immediately. The soundtrack is fire. Only real downside is sometimes you might have to grind a lot and the game requires a lot of memory.,5
"Music is amazing gameplay is fun everything seems player friendly and easy to understand non of the ba gacha confusion in other games, and has voicing too!",5
"So far the controls are incredible annoying, they should be more customizable and the option for a joy stick should be available",3
Cannot even create a co-op room because game gets stuck loading.,4
The game runs smooth and they give you ample amount of free in game currency to summon.,5
Great game wish there was more game mechanics,5
No need to spend money. Just enjoy the story and coop in free time. Pleasant experience and good music.,5
Great game,5
I didnt install so idk 😔😔❤️😣😏😏👌👌👏😯😯😯🤔🤔🤡🤡🤡🤡😩🤡😠😠👻🌛🌛👻👻😩🤡🤡🤡🤓🤡🤓,5
I've been playing this game off and on for a year and it is still fun. This game doesn't beg for money which is also great.,5
"one of my favorite games to play; it doesnt feel predatory, the graphics are cute, and I like the gameplay a lot.",5
Every update will require to download a huge package. It will occupy a lots of space..,5
Dragons.,5
I luv dis show...,5
This game is wonderfully cute and amazing. It has adorable animations and is extremely f2p friendly. 100% would reccomend,5
So good when i play this game i feel like im on swich,5
This game is just perfect. The devs listen to the players and the gacha system is great for f2p. Definitely recommend to anyone.,5
I dont always play everyday or even every month but it's a game I love to come back to,5
"Fun and very good, detailed art of characters!",5
Fun Nintendo game.,5
Fun.,5
ITS SO GOD DAMN GOOD THERE ARE NO PAY TO WIN FACTORS THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING THE STORY IS GREAT,5
I love this game so much it' s nothing but endless fun :),5
"High quality game, though somewhat difficult to play on a smaller phone. Very generous with free CS items.",5
Great so far.,3
"Rather fun so far, only problem I can voice is Cutscenes (both 2D and 3D ones) feeling sluggish along side the quest selection area, whereas everything else (home menu, upgrade menu, actual gameplay etc) runs well with little to no lag. Granted this is probably just my own phone though.",4
A game I would recommend to any Nintendo fan,5
This game is really good,5
I like it so will you,5
Pull rates are just horrible. Been playing all year and havent once gotten the featured 5 star. And I'm not free to play,2
Love it,5
It's perfect UwU,5
Great,5
Best gatcha type game there is,5
The graphics are amazing. There is a large amount of dialogue. The boss battles are really fun,5
"Game has turned around significantly, it's pretty mind boggling. I have played a number of Gacha games before but this one not only feels like the creators care about the game, but they care about the players. I've played for the last year and it went from a somewhat questionable Gacha system to never feeling like I needed to pay a dollar for the game at any time. Tons of stuff to do, level up, and they just keep adding. Raids are a blast as well. Highly, highly recommend.",5
Best free to play game ever. They actually listen to the community and implement into the game. I think the reason I people don't like this is because it's not on auto and the they feel like manually doing it every time but they added auto to coop now. The music and art style is great. I like this game for letting me pull and actually getting a unit from the banner.,5
"The controls are a bit edgy, besides that 5* ... Controls are fixed 5* all the way... months later the game is still amazing lots of things to do.",5
It has slow updates but great gameplay and content,4
"I sincerely love this game with all my heart. I've been playing since the release, and it's been a fun experience. Yeah, you may not always get the adventurer you want from the gacha, and yeah the event may be hard, but the experience overall make up for it, and the dev team is some of the best I've seen. 5☆'s from me.",5
A fun time for anyone looking for a dungeon crawling mobile game with great art and a great story!,5
Unable to connect,1
"An ultra cool battle system with balanced gameplay, plus beautiful music. Truly awesome all around.",5
Power creep is getting a bit concerning but overall a good game. Easy to get the units you want.,4
Awesome game 10/10 would recommend for a mobile game to play from time to time,5
Powecreep gay,3
This is an awesome game and the details and updates continue to make it better!,5
pretty cool game. fun gameplay loop.,5
Easily one of the most generous f2p games I've played,5
Very generous free currency. Highly recommend,5
Wonderful little gacha game. They throw a lot of in game currency your way. Always something new to do for the casual to semi casual crowd.,5
amazing,5
"Apart from the RNG luck or the lack of it that comes with every gacha game, Dragalia Lost is a very well made game.",5
Gameplay just isn't fun on phone (needs a switch port) and has too much grind that is manual only.,3
Love how interactive the developer is with constant updates and new characters. Very good graphics and nice story elements! Great game all together,5
"Great game so far! And you're so much more generous with free paid currency than all my other similar games, especially with the anniversary event going on at the time of this review revision!",5
"A great free game. Unlike most, there's enough to keep you constantly having something to do. The story and dialogue are also fantastic!",5
Mym is best waifu,5
"Fun to play, great story, great characters, and dragons galore. What more can I say. Every so often (usually with big events) I did get forced out of the game due server overload I suppose, but it is only a small annoyance that only costs you time getting back in. You'll find you still get your rewards despite the abrupt exit.",4
"A blast. Lots of depth, but still approachable.",5
Great game simple gameplay with many things to do daily. Best story for a free rpg/jrpg on mobile for sure.,5
Gooddd.. For long play.,5
"The game is probably the best gatcha game out there. If you are new to the genre and are looking to get into it, Dragalia lost is a very welcoming experience. I can't reccomend this game enough. The diverse cast of characters can appeal to anyone and the occassional events aren't life consuming and make for great casual play.",5
great game,5
Best game 10/10,5
Best gacha game I've ever played with a really interesting main story line and amazing characters! I love it to bits,5
Good fun game,4
👌👌👌,5
"Seems like a fair gacha game , will update when have progressed further. Update solid game good model lower rarity units actually worth investing in. Takes a little dedication to up all five elements but isnt impossible now my go to gatcha.",5
"I can't believe how much free stuff Dragalia gives us. The gameplay is good and the music is surprisingly good too. I've tried a lot of mobile games, but I've stuck with this one the longest by far. The team continually adds quality of life changes and gives you enough stuff to pretty much summon anything you really want to get. I can't recommend this game enough if you're looking for a good mobile game!",5
Really good game really addicting definitely worth a try if your into anime styled games. Love the people you can summon they all look super cool!,5
Great,4
I love I I. That's all I'm gonna day,5
i disliked the game so much now. i used to like in the early stages of the game. now its a big mess. ik they made some adjustments to the system but..... GEEZ 5.7GB FOR A GACHA GAME? that is too much for any gacha non-the-less. rates went to 2-3% to 4-5% and remove some characters form summons and STILL HAS A STALE CONTENT FOR EVENTS.... it was good while it lasted.,1
Great,5
"This game is incredible!! Final support 120FPS,I bought Razer Phone 2 just for playing this game!",5
"very f2p friendly, and budget characters are legitimately useful! EDIT: Still playing and now very excited for the anniversary. This team respects your time and investment. Tried going back to a few others but simply put, they can't even compare",5
Dragons are OP,5
Honestly one of the most f2p friendly games and super fun!,5
I'm trying to get the update. But for some reason l can't even on wifi takes forever,1
"Gameplay is interesting, fast pace, being able to weave in and out of auto seamlessly is nice. The summons only have 2 types now instead of 3. The game seems well liked by its community.",5
Very fun,5
Fun gameplay and loveable characters combined for an all around good time.,5
"very enjoyable, and always growing. quite time absorbing.... must.... socialize... nah nevermind XD *update* been playing for 6 months. Still gets regular updates and it continues to get better! Still enjoying greatly!",5
"Nice overall package, just feel like the controls are too sensitive.",4
Dean angel kaya angel,5
Love this game,5
happy birthday donkay,5
A Decent Gacha Game,5
Very polished action combat that works.,5
"Unfortunately I lost my old data but this anniversary is a good time for new players, seems many bugs have been fixed and the game runs smoother. 🙂",5
Another cash grab Nintendo title.,1
"The game is very cute, and very addicting. Yet it remains VERY free to play friendly and offers fun for any type of player. On top of that, the develpors are one of the best in the business- always listening to the community and constantly updating the game with lots of content. On top of all this, they are extremely generous with the gacha summoning, offering lots of free summoning currency regulalry. Overall, well worth it!",5
I'm so excited for the first anniversary thank you for all you are doing for us!!!!!😁😄,5
It good,5
Fun,5
"very endearing with the characters with an interesting story. The music is the best thing about the game and the devs are very generous with 10 fold tickets and stamina refills. please support the game and its devs! Can't think of any other dev team that supports their community more than Cy. UPDATE: Even after a year they're STILL giving so much to the community. Seriously, you'll not find another mobile game besides their other game GrandBlue that offers so much. Please support the devs :)",5
"Rate improvements, fun gameplay, waifus galore. What's not to like!?",5
Can you guys please add a training room with target dummies of each element for testing dps and practicing... also you could make a dps tracker while in the room. Would be nice to have somewhere to mess around in when you have no stamina,5
Let me play on an emulator. Phone controls are terrible for these kind of games.,3
fair and can be a bit addictive,5
"Had to edit my review after everything this game has changed..... For the bloody better!! This is the most amazing game I have ever played, the Devs are responding to criticism and questions very promptly, they are super generous with free currency, the amount of improvement of life this game had over the past year is unreal! This is a game that you just want to support :)",5
"Love this game and the effort from the devs to deliver us a lot of loveable characters! Just beware that the rates for this Gacha game are pretty bad, but we get so many freebies and gifts, that it works out. You may not always get the new hot 5* unit, but every character is useful with proper time investment!",5
Awesome 👍,5
Great game,5
Great game that reminds of the super nintendo style of games.,5
"The best Free to play game I've ever played. It's gonna be hard to play any otherobile game after this. DL sets the bar so high for other mobile games. Not to mention the game is really good and addictive. Fun gameplay, an interesting story and the awesome dragons to boot. And the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for months. Highly recommended to any casual or hardcore gamer. Definitely a 5/5 for me. Good job Nintendo and Cygames.",5
Sugoi,5
"Very fun mobile rpg with a great main story and amazing characters all with their own short stories you can follow. Outside of the story, there's also plenty of events, such as raids and boss battles to do. Extremely F2P friendly too. Only mark I can really give the game is that controls aren't very Emulator friendly.",5
5 starred. Now give me a 5 star.,5
"I was shocked to find something of THIS quality on mobile. My gosh these graphics and gameplay it's breathtaking. Just look at the character models, this is Link's Awakening level of graphical polish, I swear this looks like it could be a Switch game! It's not just the gameplay and graphics, but the voice acting and music is a lot different than most games that I've played before. Once again when Nintendo puts their minds and resources into something they can redefine the mobile genre!",5
Simple to play and very generous fantasy gatcha game. Graphic and controls are smooth. Support is very responsive. Very enjoyable and addictive. Dev has been showering players with love and freebies for the past year. The anniversary brings tons of updates that advance the game to a whole new level.,5
"This game has come such a long way. I've been playing since launch and it's only getting better with each update now that we're a year in. Extremely generous game that's very easy to be F2P in, but consider dropping a few bucks on it now and then to support the developer. It's well earned, they really listen to feedback and are constantly making the game more friendly for everyone playing. The single best gatcha I've ever played, the standard of quality I look for now in this genre. Tremendous.",5
Caring and generous devs for an incredible game,5
Super fun experience and super F2P. They keep coming out with new ideas and fresh content that keeps the game alive and well. Definitely recommend and it is my absolute favorite mobile game out there!,5
Love the game. Definitely my favorite mobile game. Both gameplay and story are solid. Really big fan of having to work hard to advance really makes accomplishments in the game seem much more significant. Looking forward to the future of Dragalia!,5
"Lots of fun, great music, generous to f2p users. Only wish would be more reasonable ways to become a paying player. It's not often I wish for ways to cost myself money but I want to support the game more. It's dramatically better made than most gacha titles. Oh, one mild con: the dub is terrible but the JP voice work is A-listers so that's fine, but don't make me beat the intro to switch settings. If you aren't gonna try, don't make people deal with it.",5
It's beyond awesome!,5
Its not bad,4
Happy Anniversary!,5
STILL 5 STARS!!!!!,5
"Overall: pretty cool game problems: low summoning ratios (but still possible to summon what you want) and I don't reallt like the gameplay, not a fan of games that needs your full atention .",5
MI SE TE YO,5
Dragalia Lost is hands-down my favourite game of all time!! I really wish he could make it for Smash!,5
"Great game, incredibly generous to f2p and a good story. Tons of fun events.",5
unique and entertaining,5
Stan Malka Dragalia Lost😔✊,5
doesn't try and take your money like other apps. devs constantly take care of the game and the players,5
Great action RPG. Gacha elements aren't even necessary to succeed. update: all these months later the game has only gotten better and better One year anniversary event is giving a hand up to new players too,5
"Super generous promotions and events, great gameplay, and fun characters!",5
I've been playing this since the day that it came out. I've never played a game this long before.,5
"MEGAMAN SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT It's a good gacha I guess... Just kidding, it's a pretty great one and have been playing since the beginning of it. I just wish I could use the alts of the one character i like on one team.",5
Its been a year and i loved the game i just can stand how much pay to win this game is,3
"Amazing art design, the dragons are awesome and cute.",5
"Cool art style, fun gameplay, great charchracters and a deep story. What else could I ask for. It's simply great.",5
Best mobile game out there right now,5
Outstanding game and developers!,5
Great. Generous devs. Fun play.,5
It's a fun interesting game but the grind is nuts,4
"This is one of the few interesting mobile games that I am personally going to continue staying dedicated to, the gameplay is smooth with it's graphics and even though the summon rates are kinda bad, the excitement that you get for a 5 star is still great.",5
Love this game have no complaints nor problems with anything imo.,5
Best. Game. Ever.,5
Anime,5
Great game,5
"I've been playing since launch and have to say this is one of the few games that didn't have month long dry spells of content. Every week or two there is a new event, yet the rate at which the game is progressing feels good without much powercreep in the new units. If you're a fan of coop and jrpgs, give dragalia a try",5
"great graphics, gameplay, story and etc... generous devs. what more can you ask? 5/5",5
Yeeee,5
It was great a** game and I would play a sequel if there was one,5
"The game is rather large and does take up space but, it more then makes up for that with the quality it brings. The game runs very smoothly, controls are easy to use, the voice acting is pleasant and overall it is fun to play. The controls consist of swiping on the screen to attack and pushing on the screen lightly to move. Very easy, the best part is if you find the controls to be to sensitive you can simply go into the settings and adjust it to your needs. The story is very long and has a lot happening, like a typical rpg. You can choose to skip the story but, I don't recommend it because then you wont know what is going on and that ruins the point of this game. The game has a draw system, like most mobile games but, it isn't so bad that not having or always getting good pulls would stop you from playing like most games. So you can very much so enjoy this game without spending money if you choose to.",5
Best Nintendo mobile game,5
Good,5
Boring. Edit: tried again 9/23/19: still boring,2
"Fantastic fun game with great graphics, story, and characters. The gacha rates are ok and the company gives out free summons all the time.",5
"I was looking forward to trying this game out, but couldn't even download the content due to countless ""network errors"". It seems the game requires a constant connection, which makes this issue problematic, but I wasnt even able to download the content patch to start the game, so I'm not even sure if it requires internet to play. I was connected to 5G Wi-Fi the entire time. Very disappointing...",1
Only game I play. Actually a good game with dev's that listen to community,5
"This game definitely deserves more. It's one of the most generous gatchas I have played and very f2p friendly. The gameplay is really fun, the story is really engaging and you can really see the effort the developers put into this game, from the mini stories that every unit, dragon and event has to the extra things that they do, like Siren's concert video a while back. I don't usually write reviews, but I feel that Dragalia Lost definitely deserves a 5 star. Happy 1st anniversary!",5
Great game. Great Nintendo feel and easy play.,5
I love this i stop playing because i got bored and now i just fell in love with all over again,5
"wow... best mobile game ever? i think so! the gameplay is super fun (although controls are little clunky to get the hang of at first), fun character designs, amazing art, solid story, tons of content, good co-op, very generous game devs... this game is basically perfect. i cannot reccomend you try it enough! thank you so much to the devs on this game for making it so wonderful ❤️",5
"It's great, the combat is fun, story is good so far, and the voice acting isn't bad either.",5
"This game might as well be called Boss Battles Inc. 95% of the game is just boss fights, one after another, sometimes even the same boss with a different skin. It's disappointing they can't think of anything else to do, because the story and characters are cool, and the devs are generous with free currency. If you're into boss grinding, this game is for you. If you want some diverse content, look elsewhere.",3
Lots better than I expected! The controls are easy and simple but effective. Story is okay. Enough to immerse you and not boring. I usually skip the stories for mobile games but I actually found myself following this one. Summons are very fair. Character designs are good. Cute and chibi-like. Looks like I'll be playing this game for a long time,5
Very fun game,5
"On every level, this is one of the best games available on mobile devices. The developers of this game work hard to constantly add content to the game and are generous with rewards. Gameplay is engaging and characters are fun and interesting.",5
"I love this game! There is so much to do so it doesn't get boring. The story and characters are great. It is NOT a pay to win game. The devs are generous with gifts, and there are plenty of opportunities to gain wyrmite, which can be used to summon characters instead of using real money. The events are fun, co-op is fun, and I really like the controls. Honestly I have no complaints at this time. Thank you for an amazing game!",5
Great game,5
great game!,5
This game requires way too many megabytes😡,2
It's a fun game that I will recommend to my friends,5
Freakin epic,5
It takes to looonnngg to downloads,1
"This game is awesome. The music, the art, and I enjoy the gameplay. What a blast!",5
"Fun. Download was slow, but fun",5
"A fun free to play that has great character designs and a wonderful localization. Thank you, Cygames! ❤️",5
"Great game to pass the time, developers are generous with all the resources and I never feel like I have to pay anything with cash. When low on any resources for upgrades it tells you what maps you can grind out for more. Summoning rates are fair and I manage to get all the 5 star heroes with ease. Overall great story, great multiplayer, its never hard to form a party, and lots of active clans to join.",5
If only don't take up alot of space,5
Fun easy game with rewarding gacha with dragons,5
Won't let me log in saying that internet connection is bad but my internet connection is great. Would like to play it but can't even begin.,1
Its nice,5
Love this game u not ever pressured to use money unlike OperaOmnia,5
Fun to play! One of the best game out there,5
"The Gacha Formula, Now Simplified!",5
Keeps crashing. Uninstalling it now.,1
Kind of generic,4
Games is very POG,4
This has gotta be one of the greatest mobile games with the amount of care put into the game from the characters to the UI. Very easy to use while making combat a fun show to watch even,4
Y E,5
Great,5
"Overall, great f2p game. Devs that actually listen to their playerbase and updates the Qol to the playerbase needs. Does not forces one to whale due to Cygames giving out currency like free candy. Splendid summoning system;only heroes and dragons. While equipment can be bought from the store. Decent summoning rates, but at the end of the day still RNG involve. Gameplay is just pure PvE with co-up so pvp toxicity does not taint this game at all. Fantastic community that helps others.",5
Very amazing smooth gamplay,5
The music...it's so HAPPY 😊,5
Awesome game cute graphics. Interesting story. Also love how music by Daoko is in it.,5
Gameplay is boring and the story is bland and generic.,3
Awesome game,5
Great game! I recommend this mobile game for anyone,5
So far so good pretty fun game,5
"Nintendo's best mobile game by FAR. Dedicated and generous development team, great-looking stylized graphics, and fully f2p-friendly. If you're a fan of gacha games and you don't want to pay fortunes, Dragalia Lost is for you.",5
The controls are aweful. Also there is way too much story to skip through. I like a good story but this just has a ton and I skip it and have no idea what's going on in the story. But either way I can't play with these aweful controls.,1
Fun easy mechanics and combat. Love the art style and mix of cinematic breaks and gameplay.,5
Teribi gamu wo suki desu,5
This game is surprisingly good I love you Nintendo lol if you want to play a mobile game that is a dope little rpg this one's good and so far it doesn't seem like pay to win,5
Meh,3
Nice little time waster. Charging times for the energy bar are fair and the game is constantly throwing new materials at you to get new stuff.,5
Gameplay is good and very original. Will update once I get farther than the first 2 stories.,4
Good game I just don't play it often.,5
Very good game,5
Awsome,5
"Awesome, pure Nintendo awesome",5
I like the game But it says i have an error and this is the only game at does this that i have played,3
Nice graphic,5
"Greetings i love this game and have been playing it since the beginning of launch. But I am also an Android developer that has my bootloader open at all times for development off apps and operating systems as part of my job. I find it unfair that phones with open bootloader can't play the game because you are trying to eradicate hackers, I fully understand banning of root phones which i am not but for open bootloaders I think you need to fix this because it is unfair. Thank you.",2
It's good.,4
Fun so far! Has a story too. Combat is fun as well.,5
Fun so far.,5
Great fun.,5
Love it!I had unload it for a reason. :(.But it was fun!Loved playing it with my little bro.We love it!It was fun and amazing.I can not find an app ever like this one. I can stop saying I love it!,5
Fun but I have no idea what I'm doing.,4
Great game!,5
😀,5
So far so good,4
Yesh,5
Absolutely adorable. For when you absolutely must play weeb trash for some reason or another.,5
"Decent game. Terrible gacha rates, you wont get far unless you have a full team of 5 stars of the same color, and even then you'll only get to their weakness and you'll have to get 5 more different color 5 stars. Bad design because its obvious they want you to whale. F2p friendly in the sense that you'll get tons of free resource that'll only give you a 4* guaranteed.",2
Laggy,3
Very fun gacha game,5
the game seems to be good. But after the 2nd download needing another 2gb storage im just gonna uninstall. This like a 4gb game. Just not worth it,3
"Why are there so many downloads in this game there was one before playing and played 5 minutes and there was another so i""m deleting this game",1
"very nice game, for a f2p player it seems very nice",5
Very fun!,5
"I always hated action mobile games coz it feels awkward to play. This game however plays really smoothly, and the controls are just right. Nice VA too and great number of waifuus (or husbandos if thats your thing). Definitely would recommend",5
So far so good! Constant updates and added content!,5
Hands down one of the best mobile games I've ever played. 10/10,5
Best action rpg game!,5
awesome!!,5
"Bad rates, ok premium currency handouts + constant events",4
Was a fun game until it came to the gacha mechanics. The rates are trash. Eight multis in a row with not one 5 star. I'm glad I wasn't around when Wyrmprints were included because this is bad enough.,2
One of the best gacha games out there. Really good graphics and character design. The gameplay is superb and outstanding for a gacha game. It is a bit grindy but that's how gacha games are. And the best thing is the generosity of the developers. This by far the most generous gacha game I've ever played.,5
Great game with great content. The developers are very generous and there are plenty of events in rotation. You are never pressured into buying anything and can play this without paying a dime! I only buy things to show my support to the devs! Keep up the great work! Looking forward to the anniversary.,5
Great fun,5
"For a gotcha game, this is one of the best. Honestly, the dev's do a really good job of keeping the events flowing. You're rewarded with nearly enough gems during almost monthly events to get a 10 pull. Couple that with the free daily and summoner tickets which they aren't stingy with and you're presented with a game that allows for FTP players and paid players alike to enjoy the game equally. I wish I could write more, but overall a pretty fun mobile action RPG.",4
Need more skill,5
Amazing game and the developers do an amazing job at keeping it up to date!,5
"THIS IS A GOOD GAME, NO, THE BEST!",5
The best gacha game i ever played. The OST is the best i ever heard in a phone game.,5
Boring,1
F2P option being a masterclass. Thank you Nintendo 😎👍,5
a very great game no the best game i ever played in a moblie device,5
"Pretty interesting game, good story",5
The best.,5
"For a mobile gatcha game, this game is ridiculously generous. Free summoning currency is VERY abundant for new players, and 'energy' for completing campaign quests is a non-issue with level ups. Even at player level 80, I'm still leveling at a steady rate and getting free energy refills. Fun gameplay, too. Try this game; it's worth it! P.S. Had the game crash on a gacha 10-pull, and came back to find I'd drawn a 5* featured character. 10/10, would break the gacha system again ;D",5
Amazing graphics and sound. Control is not that great and P2P interaction is almost non-existent. The Co-Op feature is great in theory but very restricted in your ability to interact with your teammates. Then again it is a GACHA game after all.,4
"The game is great and generous for ftp, but the netcode is terrible. Expect to get disconnected when trying to co-op, sometimes losing time and resources when its a more difficult co-op. Which sucks, because doing co-op missions is basically required.",3
The devs are very generous and the game is not p2w. It's a fun gacha game.,5
It's a fun dungeon action rpg. I will say it is a little weird controlling the game at times. There are aoe attacks that you need to avoid and sometimes instead of moving or dodging I end up attacking hopefully they allow the use of a game pad in the future or since this is a Nintendo game maybe have it on the Switch as well.,4
Everything is cute. The soundtrack is just bangers. Everything has a little story to it. The Reddit community is awesome. Get it.,5
Love it,5
"Great game, events are fun. The only problem is during raid events where people tend to crash a lot with 4 different teams.",5
This game is extremely fair to any kinda player,5
"Fun and entertaining, first mobile RPG I have actually liked.",4
Good,5
Very nice music and gameplay,5
Fun,5
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING,4
Fun game,5
Though simple in nature I really enjoy the characters and the story that they have built this game around. And the controls are actually quite fitting for a mobile game.,5
Just started playing the game and it's been fun so far. The controls are super easy and graphics are great.,5
Phenomenal job,5
Ffbhyh gf as free g by heghrq by r hee ht in regards to the yhrury yei free HR executive in he used rhrjtkrittuu and will be in uririkgkyfyjyfjnmmvnnvn dgfxhtdgstrsrt he egg wgryn HR nhfnryhjr,5
good,5
Tried this games,5
Pretty generous gacha game. Just started so i haven't really hit any walls yet. Enjoying it so far!,5
"Good for the first day, gonna stay for longer.",5
"Fun chibi, not far into the game yet though",4
"Can hold your phone straight, easy controls, fun characters. Very -on the go- friendly and fun game. Loving it",5
It's awsome Nintendo but it took all my storage so I had to delete it and in that moment I regretted,4
Awesome cool fun exiting amazing it's the best game ever,5
"Should be called ""download lost"" becsuse so far, after the first chapter, the entire game is about downloading more content, and pressing ""Try Again"" when it loses connection for no reason. EDIT: internet connection issues were the reason, lol... Slow = lose connection, need good internet to download extra content. Game is really fun.",5
Good game,5
Wont even let me log in. Says connection error and will refuse to connect on wifi AND mobile data. My phone is not altered in any way. Awful.,1
"This game is unbelievably cute and cool. This is without a doubt one of the best mobile JRPGs I've ever played. 10/10 100%, totally recommend!!!🤩😁👍",5
Early in the game but seems like a good story. Classic jrpg style.,5
"Just the overall production value alone of Dragalia Lost destroys everything in the play store right now. If it wasn't free to play, I'd easily pay $10-$20. My only complaint is the character design is a bit too cute for my tastes, but it's growing on me. Instead of thinking of this as a gacha game, think of it as an actual game that just happens to have gacha mechanics.",5
Pretty fun game.,4
Is good,5
Easy to play fun and enjoyable.,4
"It was a great game, but I sadly had to delete it because my phone just doesn't have enough space.",5
this game is great game very fun,5
a very solid mobile game. nintendo delivers once again,5
"best free to play gatcha game, ever. 2 sep 19 update: still 5 stars. It just gets better and better. Great graphics, dynamic gameplay, devs are very generous - hundreds of free pulls a month.",5
Probably the best mobile Gacha game there is,5
"Favorite gacha, lots of freebies. Charming characters.",5
good,4
Love it,5
Devs regularly update the game and listen to player feedback. In the year I have played they have improved the player experience greatly and just want to make a fun game. They also give a lot of rewards for playing so you never feel forced to huy anything. It's a fantastic game I recommend.,5
The developers have gone above and beyond to create an enjoyable game for people of all categories to play. Whether you're a gacha whale or f2p the summons are rewarding and plenty of in game currency is available. In the last month I've gained nearly 200 f2p summons. The rates are acceptable when comparing to other gacha games. The grind is real but you can tackle it at whatever pace you feel. End game content is daunting but approachable for all players with enough time and investment.,5
Really fun game. Secret of mana type gameplay and very animated with the character personalities. I had played a while ago and forgot my login info so started fresh and it seems like the rates of summoning rainbows is alot better now. Got 6 characters and 2 dragons with all the free begginers vouchers and wyrmrite,5
Good,5
"Great Game Addicting and incredibly fun, graphics are amazing, and gameplay is as smooth as silk",5
I just started today and so far it has a great story and even greater graphics and the gameplay mechanics are easy great game,5
Fun game. A bit of a learning curve to min/max your characters.,4
I like it,5
Pretty good In love the graphics,4
"It's been almost a year since the game first launched and it's only getting better. With even more QoL updates and new content being released, the game is pretty much something else compared to when it first launched. It's a lot more beginner friendly (even though it was already like that from the start) and has a good community to help others out (most of the time). First anniversary is soon with more content coming too! I can't wait to see what the second year of DL will bring next!",5
Great action adventure game with smooth controls.,4
Great job Cygames!,5
"This is my 3rd edit because Cygames keeps making the game better. Rewarding end game progression, grind is manageable, and the Gacha isn't incredibly broken. Download it already!",5
nice one,5
Beautiful and fun game. Love it a lot. Only issue I have is not being able to get rid of unwanted characters...,5
"So far this game is incredibly cute. We'll have to see if the monetization gets shifty later in, but at the moment I'm having a good time.",4
"This is easily one of the best games on the market today! I've played Dragalia Lost since launch, and it has only improved over time! It's very friendly to both free-to-play and pay-to-play players, and you really get what you put into it. The rewards are plentiful, the events are a lot of fun, and there are so many ways to customize your heroes. It's also pretty simple to get five-star heroes or upgrade lower ones into five stars. This is a free-to-play model that works and works well!",5
"Ok so not sure about these controls (i have to mentally look past my big man fingers to see the action) i dont normally like tap games but the story is keeping me in this one so im entertained and that the purpose, right? Cheers!",3
Amazing,5
Its all fun and games until you get more Wyrmprints than dragons or characters,5
Was great was really enjoying it then went to auto sell junk weapons and wasnt paying attention and sold all my weapons im an idiot so im not redoing all the grinding i did for them so this is where i say good bye to this game.. to clarify a bit i had the option checked to get rid of level 1 items but all the others werent level 1 so i was confused when all my items went boop.,4
Absolutely fantastic game. I can't rate it high enough.,5
awesome game. so far haven't been disappointed by this game whatsoever. highly addictive& quick progress,5
Good game but latest patch crashes when I try to go valfarre fight. Pls fixx,5
I just started and i got a lot of stuff for free but idk if its a lot or not. I think i got only 1 true 5 star after blowing it all already. Im still learning so its still to early to tell either way,5
"Really love this game. The graphics are great and there are lots of events and new characters added so there's lots to do. Sometimes I wish there was an easier way to navigate the helper settings and to view my collection in comparison with the whole game database, but otherwise I love it",5
Lots of fun so far and a great storyline! Graphics are awesome too,5
AWESOME GAME!,5
Best game,5
Great mobile game,5
Good game,5
Easy to learn very cute and the music is aweaome. One of the bettwr gatcha so far.,5
Fun game,5
"I've never heard of a gacha game before Dragalia, but I'm glad it was my first one. The music is amazing, the gameplay didnt get boring, every adventurer is new and refreshing even if they arent good units. I've never felt like I needed to pay to summon as the game gives a ton of Wyrmrite. Summoning changed because people wanted it to. Only problems would be event reruns, nothing new playing for months, summoning can be kinda bad at times and recommended might is lower what it should be.",4
Great music and fun to play but gacha costs too much,4
Good nontendo,5
Kinda boring but fun,4
The game is very well made and super generous. I have never played a mobile game that does so many freebies.,5
Wth is with this game i use data they said connection fail i use wifi they also said connection fail wth man,1
"Great game! Fun, addicting, and you can advance pretty quickly without having to fork out any cash. Always up to date and they're always attentive to any errors and compensate very well if issues affect gameplay. Definitely recommend. Join my alliance, Scions of Erdrick and I'll help ya level up. Alliance code 6070 6912",5
Great games with great graphics. Esay to catch on and a must play. 😁,5
Great fun game. Does not seem pay to win at all.,5
Seems decent,5
Actually enjoying the gameplay,5
God this game has been great so far. The story is brilliant and I love the animations and combat. The dialogue can be funny and the character models are really cute. Overall you need to try this game. My favourite game I've played on the play store. :),5
Awesome game!!,5
"The game is really good, gameplay is understandable, likeable characters, and very fun",4
"A really great game from devs CYGAMES and Nintendo. Gacha games are usually unfair on rates and hard to save gems for summoning. But it all changes in dragalia lost where gems are plentiful from the kind devs and summoning rates are fair. The characters in the game make me care enough to read their stories, and the gameplay is fun and intuitive. The best part of the game however, is the music. DL's partnership with DAOKO has made me fall in love with the game. Fantastic game with great devs. 5/5",5
Love it!!,5
Great game!,5
"When this game first out, I was extremely harsh on it. It was clunky, a bit slow and the rates were bad Fast forward months after that and I decide to try the game again, and it's become my favorite time waster, especially when I'm super bored and want a small but enjoyable game to play. Dragalia Lost nails this for me and the devs are actually pretty good with the community and listening, the game still has some Flaws but honestly? This is my favorite game for passing the time. 4.5/5 from me.",4
Best Gacha,5
"Beautiful story so far, controls could be better but ehh, and character design is lovely!",5
"stay away. its ok at first, not f2p friendly later. very deceptive.",2
Very good. Story action game,5
It's a lot of fun although the controls take a while to get use too,5
Great way to pass the time,5
👌,5
Holds my attention better than many other apps,5
Best gacha on the market generosity to the nth degree and fun gameplay 11/10 keep up the good work cygames and nintendo hopefully your consumer friendly practices cause a change in the gacha market,5
The friendliest and most generous gacha game developers/publishers ive encountered. Keep up the good work! :),5
"Wanted to do an updated review after many hours playing Dragalia. I never thought that I'll invest so much time on a mobile game but what Cygames and Nintendo created here is just so fun to play and surprisingly accessible for those who are not fans of microtransactions. Events are fun, expanded story, amazing dragons, top tier ost and the team's attention to player feedback has change this game for the better. Thanks again and keep it going.",5
Good game,5
Best game ever !,5
Really enjoyed this game but can't help not wanting to start over because I didn't want to create an account with Nintendo and this game doesn't let you link your progress to more common accounts like Google.,4
I love this game! It's very entertaining and the game art is wonderful.,5
"11/2018-Very fun and addictive game. Been playing it non stop since I downloaded it. So much to do. Update 08/2019- Haha, still going strong! Very fun game! Always entertaining and changing things up!",5
Super fun game! They are very generous and incentivise you to play which is super wild.,5
"I've given my all with countless gacha in the past, but I can finally truly say there is a champion and that champion is Dragalia Lost. Any inconvenience I could run into elsewhere is acknowledged in the quality of life presentation here. Beautiful visuals, top notch character design and actually captivating writing. I honestly struggle to NOT compliment this experience. If you're even partially interested, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.",5
"Game is fun, but the new update wont install. Its unplayable now. Nintendo needs to fix the issue.",5
"Its improved too much since day released, u can done all event, questing easily even u r only f2p. Battle more focus on player skill than ur money",5
Cute,5
"Super fun, although the events get a little repetitive",5
Sugoi,5
"Quite honestly the most fun and fair mobile games I have played. Once you get the overall complexity of builds and team arrangements, it's quite fun.",5
I like it,5
Awesome game. Plus dragons. So yeah. Five stars.,5
i really love this game,5
"Good game! 10/10 great soundtrack, good story, good characters. I love Silke and Siren. Would highly recommend!!!",5
Gr8 Game! Boom.,5
Great game and one of my favorite mobile games. Its a grind but you can do just fine without spending a dime,5
Fun,5
"To me its alot of fun lots of activities, very descriptive on how to level up. Great graphics, lots of character story content. Really fun game!",5
"After a year of bug fixes, I can finally say this is the best RPG on the market.",5
"Game looks and sounds amazing but aside from that it's just another gatcha. I do find the story intriguing tho. Too bad they translated this so horribly though. The power creep is real and they apparently have no concept of balance, instead focusing on the typical waifu collection. They do things like restricting the only 5* fire healer to a limited event and rigg the summon pool so it's nearly impossible to get.",2
I miss this game,4
"Please make the game smaller, the file size just keeps getting more and more bloated.",4
Great game,5
This game is horribly expensive for the microtransactions.,1
Favorite gacha I've played. The devs are really generous and it's very f2p friendly.,5
"In a market where every game is the same cookie cutter gacha with a different coat of paint, this has a very nice coat of paint. The core gameplay is also a quite fun tap control ARPG dungeon-crawler and I've yet to need any premium currency to play the story.",5
"This game is really amazing I love it. Thank you Nintendo, keep up the good work😁😀",5
Great game,5
Tons of fun and very generous gacha!,5
"Although I enjoyed playing the game, it lacked variables. Meaning I needed more in-depth game play, better control and a better loot grab but all in all the game was very fun to play. Until it became monotonous, predictable and slightly repetitive.",3
"This is alot more fun then, I thought glade, I gave this game a chance.",5
"Just another disgustingly greedy piece of garbage... I cant believe nintendo has stooped as low as the rest of the mobile game trash. They're going to do the same thing to mario kart, it's disgraceful.",1
Great Graphics!!,5
YAASSS,5
"You realize how much depth this game lacks after a few chapters. I tried getting more into it, but it's something you really have to pay to win. I expect better from Nintendo",2
(good),5
"Pretty fire, not gonna lie. The summon rates are pretty good and the controls are great. Overall, a really great game!",5
"Lovely little Gacha app, fun gameplay, good graphics, and top tier characters and story.",5
Fun summoning game,5
"I was intially apprehensive of this game, being that it is a gacha, and gachas are inherently predatory and seek to steal money from you. However, Dragalia is one of the most generous and forgiving gachas out there, and f2p is extremely easy to maintain. The game is chill, cute, full of fun music, has a decent skill curve, co-op, and is an all around good time. Just don't break out your wallet!",5
Best gotcha ever,5
"Great game with ridiculously generous dev and nice community, but game size is way too big lol (around 5gb, including voice)",5
"Es a great game, wonderful, and also intriguing",4
Super fun game!,5
Super fun and enjoyable level up process. Great art!,5
"Fun game, and after improving themselves, friendly to F2Players. Recommended!",5
9000 dude the by 9000,4
"Very good game overall with a few awkward controls. In my opinion, they are a bit wonky. I would like it if you were able to attack and move at the same time. Furthermore having a locked movement stylus would be nice too. I will say that it gets annoying having to download the next playable chapter everytime - was hoping that downloading orocess would include the story chapters. Honestly, everything else is great. Graphics, music, concept, plot, etc.",4
I love this game. The design is so cute!,5
Great production value and art. Constant quality of life updates. Generous to a fault.,5
"A solid game. enjoy the storyline and the event dungeons can be challenging. Synergizing characters is fun. Enough freebees and achievments to get you mid tier. Controls are above average but can be clunky on some heros. You do NOT need to spam money but you must watch out for summoning events and not spam summons when you dont have to. pay to progress but you wont get a massive advantage. Plenty of earnable summon rolls But if you arnt a fan of gacha, the story alone is worth playing",4
This is hands down the best gacha game ive ever played and stuck with. If you give a bit of time things really come together and everything you do is to work on getting stronger which is very rewarding. The devs of this game are very generous and that is underselling them and the character stories are great and gameplay is fun and its very cool to be able to customize builds and teams. I extremely reccomend this game,5
Gane continues to get better.,4
Addicted.,5
Im not a gamer..but I really enjoyed playing this on my new note 10 plus..can't wait to see what my characters can do when thy're all fully levelled up..,5
Fun and addictive.,5
"This is a truly great and addictive game. A mobile game has never hooked me like this and its just a blast. You always feel like your working towards something. The gacha element doesn't bother me, infact it makes me want to keep rolling. The graphics are cute and the anime sprites are well drawn. Many husbando in this game as well. The music is catchy and never gets old. Voice acting is mostly good with one or two voices not really working. Combat and gameplay are repetitive but in short bursts",5
"I stop, and come back to 3.5gb patch? Pass.",3
"Game has probably the best f2p incentive I've seen in a while, the game play is pretty fun, servers feel responsive and I rarely find myself lagging. You'll probably find a character that fits your playstyle and YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ANY CHARACTER. Only negative thing is the duplication system, it feels like everything you get a 5* and it ends up being the same unit is terrible. I would probably recommend it, if you're interested in a gacha game.",5
God bless good auto system,5
Too many downloads after the fact will nickel and dime your data.,3
"Cute characters, solid gameplay and Daoko music!!",5
"This is probably the best App game I've ever played. It's the only app game I've played nearly an entire year and still loving it to this day. The grind is on the endless side but with as much resources you get free (Not to mention how often you get free summons) with auto 2x speed and auto coop, the grind is much less of a hassle. 5 stars guys. Amazing job.",5
Very receptive developers. Fun action gameplay. Decent to good story which is fully voice acted in Japanese.,5
Enjoyable and fun with smooth graphic.,4
Great so far,5
really love the game perfect in all aspects in my opinion it's just that I can't seem to pass the co op thing it tells you to do pls fix it.,4
"Pretty fun so far, initial download requiring the game to be open is painful though.",4
Enjoyable,5
"I love this game so much! The graphics, the songs, the stories and everything are the best! Fun and addictive too. I've always trying to look for the best mobile games and this is the one! I wouldn't mind spending too although this game is mostly free. You can get many characters too and follow many events. The best of all! Edit: I've been playing this game since the first release 😄",5
Decent graphics. Seems fun enough.,4
my wife left me but i got all cleo alt,5
"An absolutely charming game. I love each character, their backstories, and the art and voice acting.",5
"I don't think it sends a good impression when someone downloads the game and immediately gets told to download 928 MB, and then at least 2 GB more when they finish the tutorial before they can get to the part where they're actually playing the game.",2
Fun and easy to play!,4
"Been on and off on this game, but is always fun to go back every once in a while",5
"Great game, I have been playing since release and have managed to have a great number of 5* characters as a f2p. The developers are lenient and usally give out 10 fold summon tickets quite often along with Wyrmite. I just wish the controls were slightly more responsive when dodging attacks ect. Great Story line and tons of characters with their own unique stories are available.",4
I've had fun but I lost my original account tho so I was sad,5
"Its all right, but not much of an online experience, mostly a stand alone. Tis a shame, this could have been epic.",3
It's almost a year since it released and I still haven't stopped playing without some very small few breaks here and there. It's very free to play friendly for those who don't want p2w games.,5
Beautiful,5
"Seems good so far. Good graphics, and summon rates seem to be decent",5
Yesterday I had to go home,5
Is gud,5
Best game ever,5
Not a bad time passer.,4
Good game,5
Really really good game. I love it so much,5
Great game especially the gameplay and graphics as such however the amount of space needed for this game is ridiculous and isn't worth it,3
"The controls are amazing. The graphics are supar! The characters have an extraordinary backstory and the area the game takes place in is gorgeous. I haven't had any problems running this game on its highest quality. If your a fan of dragons and adventure, this game is for you!",5
Fun game,5
I can't play this game! And it made me lose almost all my GB! (Problaby 6GB) I KEPT TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME BUT NOOOO!!! I WANT MY GB BACK!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
It has a good storyline,5
good strom,5
"Fun Tales of the Rays like game, good combat.",5
after update this game doesnt allow me to play anymore because of device uncompatible. xiaomi mi 9,5
game is awesome at its fullest,5
"Really fun and Cygames keeps giving away! - Edit as of APRIL 12, 2019: Holy cow... They are changing how the summoning will work by basically removing Wrymprints from the summoning pool and putting it as a way for us to pick and choose ourselves in the item shop with Eldwater. This change will hit on April 26, 2019 and honestly that means summoning for new adventurers and new dragons will be very beneficial and MUCH easier than before. Cygames, you're freaking AMAZING for listening!",5
Entertaining,5
V gd,5
The game is amazing. I found it through the Fire Emblem Heroes crossover and couldn't be happier,5
"The monetization is iffy, as I always feel about freemium or fee to pay games on any platform. But, it never felt too predatory in Dragalia. Visuals are colorful, story is okay, and the gameplay is solid. Fortunately for this game, the gacha elements are fun because I like collecting stuff, and my love of dragons keeps me wanting more of these cuties! The fact you can transform into them and control the form is a huge bonus! I was expecting just a flashy animation for a single attack.",4
"The game had a rough start, but with continuous updates, the game has plenty of content to keep you busy, with phenomenal music, and almost completely voiced (JP) Story, the steady flow of Quality of Life changes CyGames has made has steadily made this game one of the funnest gacha games I've ever played.",5
Does not make it feel like it's forcing you to use micro transactions just to enjoy the game also has a Japanese voices option although it is buried in the menus.,5
Reminds me a lot of an early PS1 game. I'm looking forward to getting deeper into the story.,5
the lag in the game is just unbearable even with good connection. And multiple times I try to re install and when I start the game it takes me to a quest but it doesn't allow me to even click on anything so I just end up uninstalling again. fix your dam game,1
a very fun game with an amazing OST,5
amazing game it makes you feel like the devs actually care about the game not letting it get ruined by greed like some of the other mobile games,5
It is cute but it takes up a lot of data so I had to delete it. I wasn't really interested in the story and after a while the gameplay became repetitive and boring.,2
awesome game,5
its fun,5
"Honestly, it's perfect. Enough said.",5
Graphics are great and a all round game.,5
good,5
"Loving the game so far. I'm not one to get into mobile games, but this game has my attention. Loving it.",4
10/10 would roll for waifus again,5
"I love this game, but it's laggy. It doesn't concern me though!",5
Very fun to play. Cute characters with powerful attacks and transformation into powerful beast and dragons. More hands on battles where you have to dodge incoming attacks from enemies. Just started playing but i don't see any auto mode which is awesome.,5
"This game is a lot of fun. Nitoicks include the overall movement system not being the best, but i don't see any better way. Good job on this tho, and keep it up !",4
sexy,5
Amazing game 10/10,5
"hey hello I am the Dragon Blood Prince and this game is awsome. Everything is nice but plz stop doing that damn update's where we have to download 2 Gigantic Bites😂😂,I-I mean giga bytes. if you can only remove that feature than the whole game will be great. So yeah that was my opinion and gonna rate and support ya 5 star Alberian😉",5
amazing game super generous developers 10/10 would recommend,5
pretty decent,5
"Art is amazing, good writing, very generous!",5
good game!,4
amazing game,5
good,5
love game,5
An adorable and fun little gacha game. Wonderful visuals and adictive gameplay!,5
The game is so cute!,5
"Amazing game, beautiful art, very generous gatcha and fun game. Hope it gets bigger in the UK! Dragalia lost is probably one of the most generous gatcha on the market right now",5
"This is a great game, but there is 1 huge issue that made it to where I couldn't get far: DOWNLOADS. Every time you progress to a new mission, it requires another download. If you can get past that and file size, you're golden for a good RPG.",4
great game,5
"So far, good...",5
has gr8 music,5
its really fun and great waifus xD,5
"Fun game. Combat and gameplay are good. Art style and voice acting are pretty good too. Not very far in but enjoying it a lot so far. Just don't get caught in the pulls, it's still a gacha game.",5
Seems fun from the first hour.,5
"This game is a treat. Great story, FUN and INTERESTING new and recurring events, lots of bright interesting characters, the most F2P friendly game I've ever played next to Azur Lane. The music is GREAT especially if you love DAOKO. Menu sounds are delightful and the overall aesthetics range from a pleasantly minimalistic to absolutely beautiful. Also the MOST generous and active devs who are on top of it and really care about their players which makes me want to support them even more.",5
"I liked the music, graphics, and gameplay, but I don't appreciate the fact that it eats up sooo much space. Maybe if a lite version were to be made, like what you guys did with Fire Emblem Heroes.",3
awesome amazing music. downloaded for the game stayed for the music,4
great game best was to pass time,5
great game wish had thumb pad control,4
❤️,5
"Really like the chibish toon,gameplay is pretty simple but very addictive.",4
"Excellent characters, beautiful art, and one of the most generous Gacha systems I've ever rolled on.",5
it impressed me i didn't expect i would love it ao much!,5
Amazingly addictive.,5
good game good summoning controls could be refined but overall an interesting game look forward to updates.,4
"great game, little planning needed to get the 5 star characters you want but they always come back if you missed out during a showcase. devs are generous with summoning stuff. new events and stories coming out all the time, keeps me coming back. new battle options and reoccuring events as well. plus i havent found a game with the same kind of combat system. kind of addicted to it now and dissappointed other games havent adopted it.",5
Got Summer Cleo from my free daily summon. Nice introduction,5
"Doesn't work at all, my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8 and I just can't get the game to go past the loading screen.",1
good game,5
I love that the sister is voiced by (what is her name?)in SAO.(I think???).,5
"Honestly, this is my MOST FAVORITE mobile game of all time. The characters and events are super cute, and they always make it fair for all players. It's not necessarily a pay-to-win type of game because they give equal opportunities to all players, including new players! They definitely care a lot about the players and always consider our feedback. I mostly enjoy playing this because the gameplay is awesome and so is their customer service/policy!",5
"Dragalia Lost has a fantastic story mode and awesome main characters. However, the stamina bar quickly runs out when you complete a few levels. Mana Circles cost quite a lot of mana to increase the abilities of each character. Duplicate Wyrmprints are necessary to increase their level. Visiting your castle is the only way to unlock higher crafting levels. Fortunately, events help players acquire most of these items but it's difficult to level up multiple warriors nonetheless. Great game still 👍",4
enjoying the game so far!,5
it so much fun,5
awesome as. 😛,5
Pretty cool game so far. Still trying to get used to the movement controls. But great game overall 👍,5
"Fun gameplay, can auto battle dailies except the 1 co-op quest, lots of cool characters, chibi characters are alright, developers are exceptionally listening to the community.",5
game is fun,5
"this game,been playing it for months now and i have to say that the argp mechanism to a gacha that this game introduced is really fun.Also the gacha system of this game is on so generous with a pity system.tbh this is one of those gacha games where u won't have to experience any salt",5
"Very beautiful, fun game with an awesome sound to it. I recommend it if you enjoy hero collector games.",5
"It's super cute! I enjoy the voiceacting, and the dragons themselves are super cute, each in their own right. I wanna see how the story goes!",5
"Lovely game with fantastic music and lovable characters! One of the better of gachas and a great company behind it ever improving the game with our feedbac, fixing problems post haste and being generous with free things.",5
epic,5
it doesn't let me download the game and I have enough space,1
Lots of fun.,5
veey fun and enjoyable but no way to back up to face book ive lost 2 acounts this way and still great fun amazing story line to replay and honestly it keeps the game alive constant fun up dates 5 stars definitly able to conect a back up sinc tp your face book till then its a 4 star just because i lost 2 accouns that where lvl 32 and 29 still a fun great game to play just sucks there is no facebook sinc to fix that issue,4
"Great Gacha with a team who listens to community. Lots of materials with every update / issue. Very beginner friendly, F2P friendly, plenty of events to keep one logging on. Played FEH from launch and it got overwhelming, especially the roster; Dragalia shines where FEH fails. You play with friends and work together with allies-- whales don't hurt you in this game. Nice community that isn't toxic. It's pleasing to look at, has a great soundtrack, and crafting is actually interesting.",5
phenomenal dev team that is very generous!,5
"Haven't felt the pressure or need to buy premium currency after a few weeks. Has some fun gameplay, and lots to do.",5
"Its Nintendo is take on mobile rpgs the summoning mechanics take after FE Heroes only with new characters from a brand new IP. It wasn't great at launch with the game constantly disconnecting from servers now it seems like they are more stable. It does feel like an rpg it, minus the touch to direct the character. Gamepad suport would be nice so that I don't have too touch the screen to direct the character it looks like Nintendo took what most mobile rpg's do 1upped them all!",5
fun,5
fun and generous but slowly becomes a chore to play and wrymprint % constantly gets in the way of characters and dragons. (edited wyrmprint % no longer an issue! now its just tedious :D ),5
fun and cool charater designs,5
"Very fun game with frequent updates. Devs listen to player issues and address them in a reasonable amount of time. Loading times are reasonable. Active multiplayer community. The game is very generous as well, often giving away a lot of currency to spend on the gacha. The in-game money shop is reasonably priced as well. I'd recommend this to F2P and players looking to spend on a gacha game as well.",5
"Really fun and addicting game with loads to do to keep you busy. UPDATE: Changed rating due to losing my account and re-logging into the game with the game forcing me a NEW PLAYER account. Tried contacting developers and was given no assistance just automated messages giving me no advise what so ever.. Had played for half a year accumulating several characters and game progress/event items/upgrades, etc..",1
worst experience,1
"Really fun fast paced combat, lovely character designs, and an interesting story!",5
roblox,1
So far so good its an amazing game,5
lots of fun. got lucky with Mikoto first 5 star. cool design.,5
Cant even play. Black screen,1
lot of lag,4
Awesome app and it has a comic strip which is hilarious. Five stars all around. The team(s) that gave us this game really outdid their selves.,5
It has albert what else do you want in your game?!,5
"Free 5 star from tutorial along with 2500 premium currency. Takes a while to get used to the movement. Chibi characters, some may not enjoy.",4
"Fails to load. Downloaded/installed from Play Store; error: ""This device is not authorised"".",1
"I wanted to give this a go after seeing someone play it. It's Cute? I guess? But the drop rates are terrible, and the shop seems very expensive.i actually had the pre-register summon bonus. Gave me absolutely nothing. Next day, advert for jewel gift, free summon! Nope, made my account 3 hours too late. This feels like a total screw-over based game.",2
"I haven't gotten very far yet, but so far the game seems amazing. Fun gameplay, likeable characters, and from what I've seen, a complex plot. Everything a game should be.",5
fun game would get 5 star + if there was no satmaina,3
"thoughtful, responsive developers. great mobile game",5
Amazing game!,5
shrink down the app size. it's getting bloated,4
I'll be back when it supports controls,1
"One of the best gacha games I have ever played. It has a great story, interesting characters and fun gameplay. It slowly eases you into all the aspects of the game so you do not feel overwhelmed when you first start out. The game is extremely free to play friendly and the developers are very generous with gifts. I have been playing for a little over 2 months and will continue to sing this games praises.",5
"This gacha game can be described as perfect for me. Appealing art style and music makes this game really enjoyable. The game is so generous than other gachas that I played so far like feh, db legends, and grand summoners. Story is engaging, thus making characters more likeable. overall, thanks for the fun experience.",5
pretty fun,4
Worth it,5
"Takes time getting used to, but otherwise great game with good graphics and story line",5
dropped this game. the events a too redundant and it eats too much space. i loved the art of this game. such a waste.,1
enjoy the game,5
eh,5
"the game is well-designed and deep. you dont have to pay to win, since there are a lot of great 4-star characters that can carry you to end game content, and you can later promote them to 5-star. two minor complaints here: 1 - please speed up getherwing regente! i really want to keep playing but i dont have enough stamina or getherwings. 2 - whats the deal with the hilly space in front of my castle?!?! it is really ugly! pls allow me to flatten the mountain with my army of dragons!",5
nooooice,5
it's irritating that you have to download every level after downloading the game,3
It's pretty good.,4
it's good,5
this was great. it is fun and good gameplay,5
it's pretty awrsome!!! I really enjoy it.,5
"This is a gem. A good story with a consistent plot with great character designs and amazing voice actors to go with them, I love everything about the UI and most importantly they are generous with summon currency. All tiers of characters are relatively viable, even 3 stars can preform as well as 4-5 stars and they are in no way inferior when it comes to designs, either.. definitely one of the better gacha games you can find. Highly recommend.",5
loved the game played it since day 1 love the story. graphics and controls they are just amazing the style works with the music and story. its is very original and I love it so much.,5
"Its been days now with no help or response from Tech Support, as a life long Fire Emblem Fan I'm extremely upset they won't assist me in even being able to start the game, and I'm unable to access units I've been VERY excited for. Until they do, this Review will remain negative as a warning to new users to not expect Customer Support to be any sort of responsive. I've received no response, no help, no assistance, on ANY avenue of communication that I've been able to find.",1
A pretty fun experience.,4
"its new and amazing, the graphics are amazing and the storyline is super interesting",5
better than khux but not by much,1
interactive.,5
one of the best games on this store only bad thing is that it's kinda hard to pull the unit you want because of ok but not good pull rates,5
"Great gameplay, even better music",5
Had some trouble with loading screen freezes every time it gets stuck for about ten minutes so had to redownload from scratch each time,3
"I don't usually write reviews, just goes to show how good this game is. 9/10",5
It's awesome,5
Good game 👍👍👍👍👍,4
"U kidding me!? This game is eating so much battery. I didn't play the game for a week to see what it does for the battery. I'm on a Samsung GALAXY, even when the app is set to sleep on the background, it ate 153% of the battery without playing the game for a week. Cool game sure but this is a 100% Uninstall.",1
the game wont even start downloading....,1
loving the story!,5
"Decent gacha, rates aren't amazing but they do go up when you don't get 5*s and the rewards for dupes are useful, so it's not as huge of a burn if you get a ton of dupes. Gameplay is simple but fun and offers a decent amount of challenge/strategy. Also comes with cutes waifus and husbandos. No complaints!",5
its cool,4
"pretty good. need more time, will update review in a few months.",4
"As a LG stylo 4 user, the game crashes quite occasionally especially during raid events/co op. Really good game but suffers a lag frequently as well. :x",4
"Since the change of game director, the game has been constantly churning out powercreep non-stop from Wedding Elisanne, Ramona and then Gala Cleo. Gala Cleo is just so unbalanced that you'd rather take her than any other on-element wand which is bs. Giving her high damage output and adding buffing, debuffing, healing capabilities coupled with a good weapon class is just too much and reflects a badly designed unit.",3
easily the best gatcha game I've ever played,5
"One of the highest quality game I've played in the mobile space, not to mention definitely the nest developer for this gacha type game. Kudos!",5
"Runs pretty slow on my device but a really good game otherwise. If you have a fast enough device to run it, I give it full marks.",5
honestly a fun game. i wish i had the irl money to support it. great fun. good job cygames.,5
"THAT HORRIBLE NETCODE! always telling people to move to a ""stable connection"" but EVERYTHING else in my phone works flawlessly...",1
Nintendo has done a great job with this one,5
"pretty cool game, what else can I say... blah blah blah, your pants are on backwards. the green sheep ate to much broccoli. I had an orange yesterday that was blue.. is it still an orange?",4
"great art, this company loved its players, and they go the extra mile by giving custom season UI and Events!!!",5
"i love this game, and the devs, the gameplay is amazing. One of the best phone games. the character art is great as well. The story is actually intriguing and fun to play through. The only suggestion I can give is to give more differentiation for each weapons moveset and making lower ratin units more useful.",5
takes a lot to download everything but besides that it's really good,4
Really fun and easy to play.,4
pretty cool,4
"Excellent story and gameplay for a mobile game, my only gripe is that it needs 5gHz wifi for co-op mode, but the rest of the game works fine with 2.4gHz. Very friendly to F2P players, not many gacha games can claim that. Overall an excellent game.",5
"update,then download 2 gigs of data.really?.😠",1
The app is worrh it just for the Dragalia Life comics on their own! All of the art and stories in this game are lovely. Also I pulled a Marth and a Prometheus so I'm gonna have a hot boy combo (no pun intended) >:),5
It's very entertaining. Been playing it for 2 days straight,4
great game it just takes up wayyyy too much storage. I also love shapeshifting into dragons.,3
great,5
"I was expecting a fire emblem like game, but this is a completely different experience. blown away by how neat it is",5
finally Nintendo made a mobile game that I can get lost in!,5
"Hate mobile games, this one happens to actually be fun and they dont seem to try to premium currently block. pretty good overall, only complaint would be that it eats my battery.",4
cool game,5
the best game I ever played,5
"Awesome game, but crashes sometimes.",5
love it,5
I would rate this game higher than I did if not for the movement controls that this game gives us access too and the fact that I sometimes get screwed over even though I'm well over the might level of the quest but overall it's a fantastic game,4
i like dragons,5
Gacha games are garbage,5
"Well put together, thought out game. Exactly the quality I'd expect from Nintendo.",5
If I could give 1 game 6 stars it would be this one.,5
ゲームは面白いけど、排出率がやばいね。。。 200連以上ガチャをしたですけど 何も無かった,3
it is a great game with great graphics and cool characters but it kept eating up my phone data,4
"Beautiful and fun game with unique characters, an engaging story, and really generous developers.",5
"The game is fun and charming paired with it's catchy music, plus the gameplay has been a fresh breath of air for me.",4
About time we got this over here.,4
fun,4
"still fun, but just like every other gacha game. 4 multis in a row and no 5 star is ridiculous. Thanks for getting rid of summonable wyrmprints though.",3
great game,5
3 stsrs for s reqo video game. just started but its too easy at first (i can tell there is going to be loads of strategy) but its also filled with be collectibles you can just buy to get ahead. thats 1 why its getting a real 3 stars. 2 its a mobile game 3 its nintendo made so ita one if the top 3 mobile games. i give it a 4 because for mobike its decent comparwd to real games it would be a 3.,4
great game tho i got a 10 fold summon ticket from the latest update it dosnt show up when i go to try summon nore does it let me use it,5
👍,5
I like this game,5
amazing,5
"One of the only gatcha games I like. As a whole I hate mobile gaming but the gameplay, characters, and music are top notch. not to mention the dev's are really generous which is a plus.",5
This game is amazing,4
awesome,5
pull rates massively improved,4
it's fun!,5
"I really appreciate what this game is about and envelopes. I have an absolute blast playing, I have never once had the feeling that I had to make a purchase just to enjoy the game because the game gifts you so much of what you need to have fun, and in abundance. The events are a blast, I really enjoyed the Fire Emblem crossover, now just waiting for a Legend of Zelda crossover, you know Prince Euden would look incredible holding the Master Sword ;) Just saying.",5
good but it lags on my phone,5
Its no fgo but its fun,4
cool,5
"its fun haha. here from heroes, its more trafitional of a scam than what i'd expect from nintendo, but its super fun and the gameplay is secure. controls are tight. good stuff.",5
"I love this game with all my heart but the storage is just too much, I had to delete it because of that and i havent been able to play for a long time, PLEASE do something about that masive 3GB storage, this game is really really good that is the only flaw i can see",4
"I like the story this far. It's had it's tech issues, but the story keeps me coming back. 😀🎶",3
great game,5
"fun, very well written game. love the in game mechanics too.",5
Fun dungeon crawling with plenty anime waifus!,5
This is an absolutely wonderful game!! The story is quite interesting and something you don't get from a lot of mobile games. And the characters are all so unique and amazing that you don't need to pull a 5* to have a blast. The co-op is also done really well. My friends and I link up almost every night to run missions together.,5
Great game with very generous developers.,5
great game,5
"one of my favorite mobile games of all time, easy to gacha without paying anything, you can even play in real-time with other players. Good story and voice acting A++ will play again right now lol",5
One of the best games out there.,5
"Developers listen to the community and make timely QoL adjustments. They're also communicative about updates, and the publisher has spent reaources on good localization. This is before we get into the generous amounts of free premium currency we get. Thanks, Cygames, Nintendo, and 8-4.",5
"First of all, unlike many other gacha games I've played, you can clear endgame content without any of meta units. Feel free to build the heroes your personally prefer. I always appreciate how generous the developers are; in just 2 days they've given us resources equivalent to 5 10x pulls. Lastly, the lack of PVP content gives the players in this game a nice dynamic. Instead of creating a toxic environment, it allows us to work together in order to obliterate harder contents.",5
"Got off to a very rocky first six months, but has been making deft strides towards improvement. Rates are aggressively mediocre and overcharging for currency are still major problems, but devs have been actually listening to feedback from players, so hope for improvement isn't completely moronic like other games.",4
cygames delivers quality content with no paywalls. a true masterpiece of mobile gaming and the gold standard other games should aspire to. an amazing blend of gacha and traditional rpg mechanics,5
"This game is really fun, the music is great, they reworked the gatcha system so that wyrmprints aren't included. The devs seem to listen to the players and make quality of life adjustments. Sufficient premium currency allows FTP or mostly FTP players to build good teams. This is the model of what a gatcha type game should look like.",5
A fun gatcha type game with a hood story and solid mechanics. Although I do have to agree with other reviewers that the higher tier unit drop rate is rather abysmal.,4
"Nintendo's first original IP for mobile devices, and it's a fantasy ARPG knockout!",5
pull rates could be better,3
So far its pretty fun since i came back but i already stumbled on a problem i pulled a legendary 5 star unit from the summer event and she is nowhere to be seen its seems like she wasnt registered and i used a tenfold summon to get her,3
Really love the new game play. thank you for all the great gifts along.,5
"Honestly couldn't say enough good things about Dragalia. It's a lot of fun, you can play casually or not. The dev team is awesome and responsive. There's a lot of different things to keep your interest. I'm hooked. 👍",5
"great graphics, story and gameplay. Wide variety of characters and fantastic music. Lovin' it!",5
I don't usually write these but here we go.. Yes the game is big takes multiple downloads and all and yes if you don't have the space and hardware it breaks. For me none of this is a problem I have a good phone. now for the actual gameplay. It's all in 3 min bits small map easy to navigate. solid for a mobile game. Having a different team for just about every boss is a bit troubling at first but it's a genius way of forcing players into learning more than just one style. had more ran out of space,5
best game,5
"Ive been playing since day 1 and the devs really know what theyre doing. Combat is fast and fun. Character designs and stories are perfect. Party banter in all the stories is hilarious. Events are fun and can be accessed basically from Day 1. New features are constantly being implemented. The pricing isn't ideal for some things but they hand you everything you need to make good teams, so you'll only need to make purchases if youre collecting everything. Overall 11/10 Mobile Game.",5
This game is so addicting & hard to put down! I spend every free minute on here & still can't get enough. I highly recommend you download!,5
"I love the art style for this one, getting new characters feels fun and exciting when they look so adorable!",5
Devs care <3,5
it is a good app,5
great game,5
Devs are super generous with free content and work hard to fix problems. Game is also really fun with great characters and storylines.,5
This is how you do a Gacha game.,5
"this game is very fun, very generous with its gatcha system. the new chat system makes the game more interactive with other players, I havent had this much fun with a mobile game in a while!",5
It is so annoying that every update I have to redownload 2 gigs of data; the whole game again. Someone somewhere on the team obviously doesn't know how to roll out updates.,1
great game would recommend!,5
Gameplay is very fun and the dev team are very generous with rewards and gifts. Only gacha i will play.,5
The best Gacha Game so far!,5
"great game, and cygames is very generous with items along with listening to feedback, almost all major player side issues have been fixed",5
"Game is just way too big even without story voice packs. I'm not sacrificing games I've spent so much time on, by deleting them for this. This is an absolute pass. Too big. Variety of characters? Oh yes, such a wonderful variety when you notice most are ""avoiding copyright"" characters from other series.",1
trash. play 1 month u will see. not much for you to play. just selling new characters,1
Legitimately one of the best gacha games out there. Generous as hell developers too. Always fixing things and adding QOL improvements. Definitely download.,5
good game so far,5
fun,5
"Fun game, great for mobile as it's easy to dip in and out of play.",4
"Fluid, fun and with an appealing art style and charm. This game doesn't feel like it was made for mobile but rather for a device like the 3DS. Most mobile games shove microtransactions in your face, but Dragalia keeps the shop as one of its smallest icons and gives you plenty of currency to summon your characters. If you are a fun of cute action RPGs then I highly recommend this one.",5
"I just loved it keeps me busy and lots of grind, patching many things at once and often plus good graphics. new units are always changing the power styles.",5
one of the most refreshingly generous dev teams and super kind communities not to mention it has gameplay that feels different from anything else ive tried played it day 1 but didnt stick with it now after almost a year im back and loving it!,5
Great game backed by great developers who actually listen to our feedback.,5
"really enjoying this game, for a mobile game it has so much going for it.",5
best game ever made for phone,5
i want full screen...,3
"great game, fun, new events happen almost every week. But HOLY it takes up almost 5GB. That is just ridiculous!",3
"my favorite mobile game by far. fun, addicting and generous !",5
Best game. Its gacha not so punishing,5
"There is so much content it's hard to get bored at any level! The devs are unbelievably commited to making fresh content and events, I've been playing for about 6 months and it still isn't stale. Also they give away so much premium currency for even the slightest maintenance that I don't even mind the optional microtransactions. 😊",5
"definitely have to grind to get materials, maxing out top tier will take 6+ months, random summoning rate is a joke. interface, characters, and storyline is awesome, they update regularly and have 2 events per month that keep things somewhat fresh.",3
is my new favourite phone game,5
"Great game backed by a great studio that listens very closely to its players. Great graphics, story, and the combat is simple and fun. The gacha aspect isn't completely overbearing and doesn't ruin the experience if players can't get the ""strongest"" units because the lower rarity units can be upgraded to match the higher rarity units. Can be played in any pace. If players want to kill time and do missions, they can skip the missions or use the x2 speed feature to finish fast. Amazing game.",5
"The only thing keeping me from throughly enjoying this game is the forced co-op. I don't mind having a co-op option, I just wish it wasn't required for a lot of the good stuff.",3
Best Gacha game I've ever played. Doesn't feel like a money grab to be relevant,5
Very fun game! Been playing for almost half a year now!,5
Fun game with generous devs.,5
great game. generous devs.,5
"day one player and im still having a blast almost a year later! rates arent the most generous of all gachas, but is still pretty generous especially considering the amount of premium currency you can acquire. Obviously you cant expect to get the unit you want even if you pull 100 times. probably not needed yet, but hopefully sometime they add a sparking feature where if you make x amount of summons (300 in gfb) you get to choose any unit (3-5*) from a pool based on the current banner.",5
They constantly give out free stuff and decrease the cost of stuff and just made the game even better.,5
I love this game. It's my favorite game to play on my phone.,5
"I have played this game for close to a year now and still enjoy it, I have never felt pressured to spend real money in it which makes it even more enjoyable. 😊",5
Good game.,5
BEST GAME ON PHONE EVER!!!,5
"Really nice game! nice graphics, music sounds cool, very entertaining, good story as well. Overall this game is awesome.",5
this is the best game ever!,5
great game and devs and overall fun and enjoyable.,5
Fun Fun Fun,5
"This game is rad as hell, friendly for free to player(s). Multiplayer is good and still more to come.",5
"i love it, everything about it",5
generous devs !,5
"The game is more fun the more you play it. It's a bit grindy, but it's fun to do with friends. Also, the developers are very active on updates and listen to the players in order to make the game better.",5
"theres a lot to do, its not pay to win whatsoever, and the game is super fun. the only issue is that sometimes you get bored of grinding. the way to rise up is to invest time, not spend money.",5
"Game crashes alot but i rate it a five stars because it offers so much grind. Each chatacter has there own unique skills and its so easy to get into the grind. Tutorial isnt long , the only wait time is updating the data once in game. Friendly reminder to all those new players that do start the game, make sure to link a nintendo account or make one for this game. Dont be like me and lose everything , I lost my account when i switched to a new phone and had no nintendo account.",5
It is so cool 😎,5
awesome game. long time player. best game I've ever played,5
pretty good,5
"The high level of quality in this game is apparent, and Dev response is top tier. Fun and easy to get into. Solo gameplay is ok; really shines in co-op raids/boss challenges. The art and music is also wonderful. Definitely worth a try. UPDATE: Prior complaints have been addressed (re: weapon crafting and eldwater scarcity), and many QOL updates have been added, like 2x auto play speed, removal of wyrmprints from the gacha, and decent chat feature. Very easy to ignore in app purchases.",5
"Best. App. Game. Ever. in my honest opinion, been playing it since day 1 and I think I've only missed a handful of days...rng is fair (coming from a guy who has gotten quadruplicates of 5 stars), it's easy to understand, good lvl progression, fun and entertaining side stories for each character, and better yet the developers are kind to the players!!!!! huge win there",5
Possibly the most fun and the most generous gatcha on the market.,5
"Plays everyday and I've only missed 2 days not playing since 2018. Not addicted, but more like a routine to me to play at least 10 mins to an hour a day. Overall great game. decent story line, pretty good gameplay . And they do fix bugs and listen to feedback more often.",5
good enoufh for 5*,5
good graphics and controls with amazing artistic features one of the best phone RPGs I've played,4
great game I've been looking for a game like this for ages,5
"I can't help but love this game. Good balance of gameplay, the urge to get the newest and best character, and that need to collect and upgrade that RPG's are always perfect for. Keeps me coming back a full 10 months after release.",5
"Generous, transparent regarding updates and player feedback! Always working to improve the game.",5
gj Nintendo,5
"Fantastic game that deserves a lot of credit. Haven't spent one dollar on the game and I enjoy every part of the game and have some of the best characters, weapons, wyrmprints, and dragons. The development team is always concerned with their player base and never fails to impress. By far my favorite mobile game I've ever played.",5
Neato,5
too many times of downloading! haven't started the game but have already spent an hour downloading crashes all the times when I'm playing the multiplayer games! 4 times today now! Game itself is fun,4
A fantastic game that doesn't lock you behind a pay wall. The dev's are very generous!,5
"amazing game, great love from developers.",5
Cute dragons. possibly one of the only reasons I continue to play this game.,4
good,5
"Character design, art style are top notch. Generous on points for'gasahpon' to get new characters. Events seems pretty frequent, keep you busy all the time, which is great, but the user interface arnt prefect(still good). Almost NO WAY communicate to players you've met in game, you can send them friend request but either they accept or not, still cant interact with them, unable to inv to clan nor game, unless already in the same clan. Game matching system fail on1specific event for me, tried40m+",3
The game devs have great communication with the community and always give us good compensation.,5
"This game has probably the best and most responsive developers out of all gacha games. They have fixed so many problems that players had, and continue to improve player experience. Also is one of the most generous gacha games.",5
"great storyline, graphics, and controls. voice and music is very catchy. no need to pay to win.",5
amazing,5
"Aptly described as ""mobile Monster Hunter with waifus"". The gameplay itself is fun, the grind is pretty painless, and the developer is very attentive and generous to the community. The effort put into the story is just shy of a full anime, going as far as to rope in big-name Japanese voice actors. While the paid content is terribly overpriced, it's pretty par for course on gachas; free players don't really miss out on anything.",4
Dev team is very responsive with the community. They show effort and love! 8/1/19 to this day they still show a lot of love to this game and a lot of QoL changes. It's amazing how consistent this team is.,5
"very fun game, lots of characters to play. super cute dragons and people. the artwork can be pretty great at times with a gripping main story and tons to do after that. events are non stop so theres always a something to work towards.",5
"My favorite gacha game to play, the devs are pretty generous. Bless cygames.",5
"Great game and a lot of fun, even without microtransactions.",5
"As far as mobile gacha games go, this one is nice.",5
An amazing game. Great gameplay. Tons of story content. Generous random elements. Friendly community. This game has everything. But it's a huge download so make sure you have room for it.,5
"If you like Granblue, you'll like this game! Not only does this include a vast amount of characters (some even from Granblue), it also has many gameplay improvements, and more interactivity with nearly everything. There's a lot of appealing aesthetic to it, and deserves to be given a go!",5
Not normally into moble games. This one's cool though.,5
Nintendo Quality game,5
"A very well-crafted game and the epitome of what good gacha games should be like on this platform. Fun characters, yet tongue in cheek about the overall silliness of the game. The only detriment is the lack of a horizontal-grip mode, but the rest of the game's quality makes up for it.",5
Best mobile game on the market. It's Nintendo and Cygames. Can't go wrong.,5
"Game further improves upon my return, wyrmprints being bought with eldwater rather than pulled making it easier to summon characters or dragons. Alliance is great I guess, although I'm getting a bit spooped for potential guild wars like content considering cygames other 2 gachas like priconne or gbf.",5
fun and interactive game I play on my ride to work each morning on the bus. good sense of player progression snd rewards also f2p friendly,5
"Gameplay is unique from other titles, campaign story is good, the grind is forgiving enough that you don't have to pay for anything, and the artwork plus voice acting is solid. My only complain is I wish there was more development to the characters story",5
"Really like this game, I've been playing this game since it was released. Developer have been constantly upgrading and improving game contents. Every 2 weeks new event and units are getting release. If there's a bug or glitches it get fix almost immediately. The company listens to their players with suggestions on how/what needs improvement on the game and keep the player base interested on playing.",4
Fun game with insanely fair gacha.,5
Fantastic! as most things nintendo does. Great game play and awesome graphics!,5
legit one of the best gacha games ive played,5
good game,5
"its the most amzing I've ever played you just can't get enough of the graphis, the characters and the amazing story arc and it keeps getting better with every new update😆😆😆😆😆😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄",5
"I used to play it all the time. ive updated it and now it doesnt load and when it does, it crashes.",4
"This is the most generous gacha game ever! They give out free summon tickets and wyrmite like it's no big deal! A lot of their more recent banners such as wedding units and summer swimsuits are not even limited, so you can have a chance to get them year round. Oh and with the recent update, they give you 1 free single summon for each weekend day on each banner. Bless Nintendo.",5
nice,4
"Gameplay okay like any other f2p. Music is excellent! (best part of the entire game) Can be very choppy (might have to downgrade the setting) Story is is good. Voice cast is a huge plus for me, very nice english dub. Take 5+ GB of space. Overall it's worth downloading.",4
"Fun action RPG from Nintendo and Cygames! Engaging story with fun characters. Gameplay is tight and fun. Graphics and Music are excellent. Uses a Gatcha system for characters, but is probably the most player friendly and FTP friendly system I've seen in a mobile game! Update: game contines to be fun! Added alliances and a more generous Gatch make tbe game even better!",5
DragaliaLost,5
"I recommended this game its awesome , probably one of the best Gacha out there and trust me the 1gb dowload is worth it ""Play Dragalia lost"" ~ Liz",5
lots of fun. light humor with plenty of customization.,5
this is by far the best free to play game I have ever experienced on a mobile platform. I have yet to spend a dollar on the game and I have hit no pay wall or shortage of fun and content. i have been playing well over two weeks at this point and quite a copious amount of hours each day as well. keep up the good work I an enjoying every update you put out,5
AMAZING ANIMATIONS AND GAMEPLAY! I love the game so far and i just got it. The character designs are wonderful!,5
I love this game it is just so much fun!😁,5
"From the first moment playing this game, i have been hooked. The story is wonderful, the characters are a delight, and the artwork is stunning! I have very little to complain about, I love logging in and working through the story and the events that pop up. This game is worth every second!",5
great game i love it,5
"I really love the game, the graphics of it is really amazing and it's really fun to play mostly when I turn to a freaked Dragon lol... but in all its really fun and cool to play😊😊",5
cool graphics and I enjoy the pace of the game too!,5
"This is a great game, except when it comes to storage. When all data is downloaded, it is about 5 GB of storage used. Please reduce the game size if possible. Makes it hard to store on, especially since my phone takes 10 gb out of 16gb to run.",4
"Cygames is probably the best mobile game developer, they truly care about the user experience and it shows on how they treat the game players. One of the best experiences I've had playing a F2P game.",5
its a good game just like to point out that the touch delay is a little anoying when you fight but over all great game,4
well i cant even RATE the game becuase i cant even play it!!! inoitarally waited like 2 hours for the screen to load and it didnt even work!!,3
"Nintendo is consistently slam-dunking mobile gaming and Dragalia is no different. Here's what Dragalia (and Nintendo Mobile) get right:  1) Interesting core gameplay - the core mechanic of swipe to move and tap to attack gets spiced up in a lot of interesting ways  2) Characters you care about - With fully rendered cutscenes, hundreds of optional story episodes, and (my favorite) a very short story summary when you skip a cutscene, I find myself actually caring about the characters and their challenges.  3) Literally Free(mium) - I've played about 60 hours so far and have enjoyed all of it without spending a dime.  4) A good learning curve - the game does a great job of introducing you to one element at a time and giving you time to get a feel for it - I've never felt like I made wrong initial choices.  5) Skill Matters - Your ability to win or lose at most of the content is largely determined by a) your skill in positioning and b) your skill in setting up a team.  Dragalia Lost is a blast for anyone looking for a Diablo-style ARPG, and is in league with the polished, grade A, affordable Nintendo mobile library.",5
10/10,5
Nintendo has done it again. a great animated game and the story is great. well done Nintendo.,5
I've barely started and it seems a drag. There's a lot of additional downloading. There's a lot of story scenes that slow down the time you get to play,1
"Good gameplaywise, terrible gacha rate ups.",3
Pretty neat so far. Very generous with the gatcha currency and summon costs. Music is top notch too.,5
"This game is made so well for a moble game. The graphics are great, the gameplay is reminiscent of a simplified console game, and THAT MUSIC! HOWEVER, this is a gatcha game, and it is THE MOST STINGY I've ever seen. The main things to summon are dragons/adventurers but the odds of getting one, let alone a 5*, are RIDICULOUSLY low. I've played regularly since launch but F2P so I've never got a 5*. Its disgusting how rare/expensive everything is. EDIT: The summoning pool was fixed, negating this.",4
incredible games,5
"The game is overall super fun. The plot is nice, the characters (both main cast and summon characters) are so full of personality, and the dragon designs keep getting more and more amazing. Plus, getting all sorts of stuff from one login is a breath of fresh air.",5
"Such a fun and engaging game, however i wish it was easier to unbind 5 star dragons as at the moment it is too tedious and time consuming.",5
This Game Is SOOOO FUN! I have a 1 suggestion tho. Can u please add that they talk all the time cuz it sounds like they're not even talking to u. keep workin hard. its a great game!,5
"Good storyline and characters. You can play casually, but you can also put a lot of strategy and planning into it if you're looking to get super strong. It's a fun timekiller if nothing else. Has a few glitches in the system, though. Sometimes doesn't display all of the enemy attacks properly and that's gotten me killed a few times. Like, maybe I'll run right into a wind vortex because it isn't showing on my display. It's not that often though.",5
Game is great. They listen to the community and constantly make qol improvements. There are some minor issues with the game difficulty not being properly gauged like certain stages saying that you can clear with a 15k might team when really you wont even scratch the boss with anything less than 18k but otherwise the game is awesome.,4
One of the few gachas that actually listen to the players,5
INDUSTRY CANCEROUS MONETIZATION GAME,1
Dragon friends and dragon lovers - the important things.,5
"Great gameplay, rhough a bit too much data absorbing, I was only able to keep playing after I got an SD card. I also would like if it cost less to promote 4 stars to 5, since its been a pain so far",5
much improved since launch,5
"Great game, super fun and enjoyable",5
The Devs actually listen to you and constantly make the game's quality of life better. The game is casual and you never feel behind or pressured like other games. There is no major tierlist and you can basically use whoever you like as long as you keep within the elements. the music is also amazing great for those people who want to get away from all the craziness of gatcha games.,5
Its an awesome game but its still a bit lagging,5
amazing game,5
love it so much so fun if u read my comment download it trust me😙😚😗😚😗😚😗😗😚,5
Nice game,5
clothed anime tiddies,5
Thank you so much for fixing my storage. Best game on the app store for sure!,5
dope,5
Nintendo has made such a wonderful game here. full of events both new and returning. they really allow for ftp gamers to enjoy the pve. haven't done much in the way of pvp. graphics are wonderful game runs smooth and the gameplay just as much. I'd suggest this to anyone wanting a diverse rpg that's been well rounded with a good community. :),5
"Cannot ask more for a mobile game, very smooth controls nd graphics. soundtrack and Japanese voice covers are awesome.",5
"You really need to fix the co-op. One day it works and can join and another day, it just loads and stalls. I have to close and reset the game to play again.",5
"fun gameplay, interesting story, hasn't pushed micro transactions so far",5
mym cute,5
"This is the best gacha app i played. Generous devs, frequent quality of life changes, best game.",5
"love this game so much, really ftp friendly and the devs are so generous! the only thing to look out for is the high data demand, but that's about it!",5
"I've been playing every day since it was released. Beautifully appealing graphics and music, great characters you'll want to collect, and surprisingly deep and feature-filled gameplay.",5
"EDIT: Probably the most responsive dev team I've ever heard of, pushing out many updates and having really clear communication. The good: art, fun game play, story (surprisingly good), 4-player co-op The bad: 1% chance to obtain 5-star adventurer, wyrmprints being lame, moronic AI",5
great,5
"good game, very fun.",5
"Love the game, but I do miss how the summoning animations used to be informative.",4
Good rates AND it has really good music from the amazing artist DAOKO,5
This is my favorite mobile game of all time! What makes the grind worth it is that I've got my two favorite characters Mym and Xainfried and I use them often!,5
"It's alright, I need more cute waifus",3
"Best RPG on mobile, super stoked.",5
great,5
"This game is great, the Devs are great. I love it <3",5
"Love this game! I've been playing for over 6 months, and I still play it basically every day. Such a variety of things to do and ways to build your team. Props to the Cygames team!",5
it makes fun of me by giving me duplicates,4
Awesome!,5
"Love this game, It works great on my chromebook! I hope you make an alternate control scheme for crhomebook users though. or import the game to switch as a free to play title. XD",5
"I absolutely love this mobile game. It's still a gacha but the way the game looks and handles along with the very smooth multiplayer and the actual high end endgame content more than makes up for it. There is so much to do and they constantly update and release new events to keep things interesting and fresh. It's amazing what they have done with this, there are some console games that can't even compare. Once you pick this up it will be very hard to put down.",5
"F2P friendly, no need to chase the meta when even 3* characters can also do what 5* characters do, very generous with compensations and doesnt hide bugs or leave out information on update logs. Fun, friendly and quenches your Husbando/Waifu",5
"its a very fun and charming game. The cast of characters grows over 100, and each of them has a little backstory about them and details that other Gacha games wouldn't bother going for. Almost every character is viable, so long as you play well and invest in the character, so the power creep of ""5* superiority"" is only there if you believe it. being a Gacha style game is the only reason i rate it 4 stars. everything about Dragalia is fantastic.",4
"honestly one of the best mobile games available. the gameplay loop is solid, engaging, and doesn't force micro transactions on you at all.",5
"Great game, f2p friendly, a lot to do, a new guild system is available, plus more. since its nintendo, they could colab with other nintendo franchises (which they have done (fire emblem)) and the game isn't too demanding if you play on a daily for around 30-50mins. so overall, an excellent game 😁 Ps, for those having an issue with the download and looping sound track, its the first hurdle once thats done, that's it. I'd recommend ignoring that and just enjoy a free game.",5
Great fun one of the best mobile games i have played. Really well done to the devs(and the music team amazing job). Am a free to play player and no problems so far. I would like to add the gacha definitely exists in the game and in my opinion its not all that bad.(they got to make money in someway) You can make the game work with 4 star units in conjunction with the 5 star units the game decides to give you.,5
"Really excellent gamep!ay, fun characters, fair draws. It's got everything.",5
Most free to play friendly mobile game available,5
Meh,5
"The best, if not one of, gacha game there is. Most games have 1-3% SSR rate. This game has 4% and 6% every 2 months.",5
fat notte best notte,5
Cute game. Easy to control and fun. Characters are varied and you get characters from event. Can be played as F2P without spending much money.,5
"love, Love, LOVE it :)",5
Awesome! Not just Another Game!!!!,5
"fun, controls are kinda wierd.",4
cool,5
ok,5
"Seems good so far. But wow, it takes up 5.42 GB of storage.",4
"One of the best gacha games i've ever seen, and the dev is generous af",5
"A great game with smooth, vibrant graphics. If gacha is your thing, then look no further than this masterpiece in bitesize entertainment! In my opinion, one of the more generous gacha-likes out there in terms of rewards and feasibolitu of collecting them all (given the rerolls and mercy mechanic in the game).",5
Cool xdxd lollol he said that he was a little bit more time with the kids e to be in the middle of a sudden he was like a little bit more than anything else to do that to you too baby and I was just thinking about the same thing as you can see the 🎥 is it a try and make it 👆 to the gym now I am not going to the 💪 now I am not going,5
been playing this game since day 1. its really a great game in many ways. The art and story are beautiful. The developers do listen to the players and keep improving in a fast pace. New content delivered regularly to keep the game freah.,5
really good story,5
Good fun,5
"wow im truely impressed with this free game. you can really see the difference between a random dev and an experienced one. im just surprised its so fun considering similar games out there. i recommend you try this game. for better downloads turn off the voices, and play till you have a full team AT LEAST. extremely fun.",5
Amazing Game! Been playing for ablittle but I'm really enjoying it!,5
nice game,5
"Voice partially, addictive story. It can be play with one hand.",5
"another way of playing heroes collection game, good effort.",4
"Cheesy and predictable storyline, somewhat outdated graphics, OK gameplay. Now, the good points, great music and ost.",2
Excelent for a free game! Defendantly worth checking out.,5
its a pretty fun game to toggle through!,5
excellent game,5
is gud,5
"Over the past several months. Cygames have actually listened to fans, made improvements to summoning, and been generous to players. The music, visuals, and story are definitely superb. Unfortunately, the raid and facility events have been getting stale. The Fire Emblem event and the weekly Astral Raids were great events/additions so hopefully they have something similarly exciting planned for the first Summer Event, the upcoming anniversary, and beyond.",5
"I love this game. It's just great. Definitely deserves a better rating, so that's why I'm leaving this one. It's fantastic. Whoever may be reading this who doesn't have it yet, do yourself a favor and download it.",5
love it just give me gala Cleo pls,5
"This game is fantastic. The gameplay is fun, the art and music are great, and the developers are constantly adding new high-quality content with massive support for F2P and extra bonuses for paying players. All that and they don't force you to lose the rest of your life (though it does help) to win. The summer banner is coming up, along with the anniversary and the addition of a guild system making now a great time to start playing. Great game, now's a great time to start playing. 'nuff said",5
"Is a gatcha game... so is not really a game but a paint job for an exspensive online casino where you win nothing of value, yes they give you.plenty of free spins but when a ++rate up event is 0.5%, well you have more chance at betting 1 in roulette and winning. This game does not exist as entertainment but to remove money off adults and children (it is Nintendo after all) and leave them with nothing. Legislation cannot come into effect soon enough on this morally bankrupt plague.",1
couldn't get it to work,1
"best hack slash, even though repetitive but the rng makes difference, you gotta to timing play everything combo-skill, iframe etc",5
good time sink,3
Great!!,5
amazing,5
"Simple controls, lots of depth and a fun gameplay loop with generous gacha. Definitely recommend.",5
"cute visuals, it's enjoyable for a mobile game. wish i could play it on pc or switch.",4
good game,4
Exciting to play,5
Great Game Definitely Doesn't Deserve This Horrible Rating,5
"Honestly, I don't know why but I wait for the game to finish downloading data, but the problem is that it WON'T download the data, even though I have good reception and I have enough data.. Which makes me sad honestly, because I really wanna play this really cool game to its full extend..",2
Its pretty fun so far.,5
"The only thing that would make this prefect for me, is if you could reuse mana circles for other characters. This game is new about making new characters to add to the roster, which makes it fun and interesting.But the mana circles are really hard to level up, so it would be nice to use characters mana circles that you dont use anymore, to use on another.",5
i am only commenting while this game is donloading on my phone and i give it 5 stars fir no reason when i never played it,5
"this game is amazing, live the music and artwork, people who complain about summoning should play epic seven and see how that goes, overall very nice game",5
"Great Concept. Terrible dialogue. Another pay to win game, designed to exploit people. Shame on Nintendo. Just charge us for a good game like it used to be.",2
great game,5
"With Cygames leading a generous, successful game in Granblue, Dragalia Lost may as well be the sister app rising to it's own success. Like any other gacha, you WILL be expected to grind your butt off at times, but progression is rewarding with many ways to customize your teams considering the game is so young, and the generosity of the team keeps it one of the most viable f2p options around. I highly recommend giving it a try! I hope to see more gbf characters crossover, too!",5
ish gud. lotsa waifus and husbandos,5
good,5
"I have no idea why this games score is so low, it makes no sense when it is this good. the story is great, the characters are likeable, and the game play actually makes you feel like you input as a player matters. just like other gacha games the rates can be pretty bad, however, you get so much free currency that it does not matter. the only thing I have to say has been annoying is that sometimes I cannot connect to the game, after waiting a while it will let me though. Great game.",5
cool,5
"Fair gacha, cute characters, and just enough story and events to keep you reading. Everything except co-op can be played manually or be put on auto, so even material grinding isnt too bad. I'm having fun, and looking forward to year two.",5
"great game, character develop on point, cant wait to play more. hope the dragon development is not linear",5
One of my favorite games. It is a fun game that has 3D characters that you play as. I t also has a gacha mechanism and there is different events and stories to play.,5
nice,5
cool game.,5
Excelent game!! i love you cygames,5
great game just hate the controls but a great game never the less,5
I just wish I had the storage for this beautiful game.,5
"Love the game,handles well. But i must say the chibi look is what made me want to colect more characters, and all the dragons look super cool. keep up the good work 👍.",5
"This game is pretty good! Solid Designs for u its/dragons, good gameplay and all of the additional content we've been getting is nice to have! Story is solid, and I really appreciate the communication between the team and the consumers. Problems I had originally in terms of playing online seem to have been fixed entirely and I enjoy recommending this game to my friends. A joy to play; F2P friendly of you know how to save for gachas in my opinion.",5
very nice,5
Very generous,5
amazing game! addicted! hope a sequel comes to the switch!,5
quite fun,5
Really great RPG on the same line as the console ones.,5
"i highly recommend it.gameplay is fun,graphics are nice,and the music is still stuck in my head.my only complaint is how easy i found it(even then,i decided to have no allies and upgrades.gives it a bit of challenge).it also is good for those really short moments peoplr have before going to work.",5
"It's a gacha game with mediocre odds, but the developers are fairly generous with giving away premium currency.",5
"Man, i was looking foward to playing this game but it requires so much space i couldn't download it!! I deleted a ton of apps but it still required more space. Disappointing honestly, i heard the game is wonderful.",3
a lot of content lasting for months. game doesn't require spending in order to progress,5
"a thing of beauty, highly recommend for any and all players migrating from previous games or looking to try something new. Take control of a hero and dive straight into acrion, gatcha feels fair and events in game are very frequent. Download and see for yourself C:",5
"good game, really eats at your phones memory",4
fun and enjoyable story cant wait to find out more as i move on with the story :),5
I like it alot!,5
When the game first came out you felt the brick wall for pay2win. But the game has changed and been rebalanced to make the game a lot more enjoyable now. Paying only accelerates your growth or saves you time but you can farm gems just from playing and cygames has been very generous with gifts as well.,5
"good game, really f2p friendly",5
"Actually the game is ok but the battery drain is serious, downgraded 4 to 3 stars. we need to grind to get wyrmite and tickets. It has very low rate of getting 5 star heroes or dragons that you want. I suggest we could get more shadowverse characters, like Arisa and Daria. Would be fun if could implement pvp.",3
10/10. cygames is very generous with in game currencies,5
This game super good mostly with the stpry telling,5
really good game,5
It's cute,4
"I enjoy the game quite a bit, it's really fun. Great graphics, decent story, memorable characters, awesome style and design, and it's simple/complex enough to appeal to anyone. Only problem I have is being handed a full team of 4* units right off the bat, from the story, rendering all 3* units almost useless immediately. Otherwise, no gripes from me!",5
"Nice art, graphics and music. Good effort into giving all the summonable characters a semblance of a backstory. Storyline is rather cliché. The game suffers mechanically: Portrait view limits the already poor control mechanism and the auto controls does such a bad job at navigating, leaving you with frustrated with many cheap deaths, especially in trap heavy maps.",3
fum gatcha game of corse there is alot of grinding but it is executed well,5
"Honestly, rather have Miitomo than this. It feels like an another generic anime RPG that I will never pick up again.",2
no baf gane no fun,5
"Its not bad. Definitely not great. The menu is far too convuluted and the levels, at least the first few are incredibly simplistic.",3
"I just hope the game could be played portrait, it feels a bit odd to play it vertically.",5
D R A G O N S,5
"I loved this game... when I could play it. Unfortunately, when I was moving to a new device, I overwrite my save file with a new file a lost everything! I still love the game, but I don't have the patience to go through everything. Great game!",5
🤗🤗,5
fun and addictive. no need to pay for items. lots of free grinding,4
"Gameplay and music are great, love the artstyle. The devs listen to player feedback and always improve the game. Lot of offbanners on the gacha but lenient enough to allow for more rolls. Satisfying challenge on the bosses.",5
pretty cool so far,5
love this game can u add a 1v1 mod and can the charcters have diffrent attacks also for bows can u pls... pls add guns,5
the GAME IS SOOOOOOOO GOOD,5
great game,5
One of the most FTP friendly games on the marketplace. Controls during combat are a little fiddly but it's a minor thing.,5
Nice characters,4
"Great game. Very F2P friendly, enjoyable and somewhat interesting storyline. Would recommend!",5
awesome game all in all.,5
"A nice story and some decent gameplay, but all in all it's another typical character collector grindfest kind of thing",3
Good free to play game,4
good game,5
Graphics are pretty amazing and the UI is very smooth. Well done!,5
"Summoning rate is awful even with special banner. The game is alright but gets repetitive quickly. There's not much here other than events they put out every other week or so. Graphics are great, story is ok, voice acting is good, that's pretty much what I can give to the game.",1
very fun and addicting,5
What you mean why I gave 5 stars? This game has the Nintendo Magic and its by Cygames,5
"This game is by far the most generous game in terms of in-game currencies for making gatcha pulls. The gameplay is incredibly well polished far above many other games. The meta gameplay systems are very well thought out, and you can complete all major content with the free characters in proper equipment setups and composition. Finally, the devs tend to just hand out rewards in the form of currenies and level up items left and right. This is how you do a proper gatcha game.",5
please fix the loading screen,5
love the game and the game play,5
i love the game and the hrind but my lucj is very bad it hurts my soul,5
Dragalia Lost is a fun game. I was led to this game by my brother.,5
great game!!,5
Seems fun so far. I'll update when I've given it more time.,4
I detest stamina games.,1
Took them long enough to fix my issue I had a long time ago. back to 4 star.,4
i lovin it!!,5
This is a tendonitis simulator with cute waifus.,3
"Wonderful game held down by one of the worst gachas I've ever experienced and is, unfortunately, on mobile. This game has so much charm and the character design is amazing. Controls are okay but a controller would work SO much better. The gacha is absolutely awful. Ive played this game for 8 months, and I have only pulled 6 unique 5 star adventurers, excluding the Fire Emblem heroes (who were a limited run). Really makes me want to spend money on your game when I wont get anything from it.",3
Solid lol,5
best mobile game I've ever played!!!!,5
not bad,5
"Enjoyable rpg with depth and difficult higher end game content as well as easier content to play. Lots of events. Very friendly gacha with lots of premium currency. Heavy gear grind for end game content. My favorite mobile game since Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, replacing it as my main game that I play daily.",5
"it's great, nice story but could be a bit better and way to big",4
now I really like this game but this takes up too much storage yes I do understand why but still and why does haved to load when im about to play a level it is a relly good game don't get me wrong just too much loading and i hop it won't take up all of my space I had to delete like 7 games too get this yes i did not play alot but what if I did then I could not play this but overall an amazing game please fix this thank you,4
it is really good,5
I love this game my number one game I ever play. and the bad reviwers are A joke. they say it's A pay wall but it's just they too lazy too do the dailys. and I want to know how and why this is pay too win? becouse They are the most generous games you ever play they even give you the 3 5 star Valchers trust me thats the most rare Item in this game that you ever got. and they listen our feed backs. completely free to play This game deserve more A really good game and and I love you Nintendo! 😊,5
excellent gameplay and story plot. im very impressed.,5
addicting game for sure,5
Developers actually listen and fix game flaws. They are also extremely generous. A lot of 3* and 4* heroes are better than most 5*. Game definitely deserves a much higher review rating than the 4.2 it currently has.,5
great game great dragons what more could you ask for,5
I HAVE NO IDEA NINTENDO MADE RPG GAMES!!! THAT'S SO COOL! 5 STARS!,5
"Very great game, has an easy control along with a cool design, music and story. It's honestly perfect. The only aggravating thing is my rng luck with summoning.",5
"Genuinely one of the best gatcha games on the market, I've had an absolute blast playing so far. free to play is surprisingly generous with rewards, I havent had to spend a single dollar and summons come through at about the perfect pace.",5
"great story, the gameplay is easy to grasp and fun and the graphics bring out a true Nintendo RPG feel",5
Best game ever!!!!,5
Cool so far..😉,5
"amazing game, and an interesting story cannot wait to keep going!",5
As far as free to play games go this one is definitely worth the look.,5
Been playing since day one. Fun game. F2p friendly. Has a nice community too.,5
fun gacha game. presentation and gameplay is professional and smooth,4
best rpg game,5
"very good game, I love the sylvans",5
very epic,5
"The best gacha game, bar none. Plentiful rewards for playing, tons of great characters and options for F2P never make you feel like you must spend on the game. Great action and strategy with several modes, including raids!",5
so far so good. will update later.,4
"A phenomenal game. Mechanics are interactive and playful, yet simple enough to understand. The graphics are ADORABLE. Extremely fun and creative characters and storyline; great voice acting, good rates, I absolutely love this game. 90/10",5
fun and good game,5
"game runs like hot trash, even on the lowest setting",1
Awesome I like Dragalia Lost,5
The dev team actually cares for what fans have to say and I love it this game is great,5
"Good controls Good graphics 11/10 great husbando and waifus f2p friendly and most importantly, the devs listen to the players",5
This game is extremely ftp friendly. Hitting the anniversary in a couple months and the game is going very strong.,5
awesome,5
good game,5
this game is amazing nothing else to say,5
"Incredible game.. Please ignore the overly negative reviews.. They have fixed every single 'issue' people complain about.. and they do it rapidly.. this is an incredible game, that listens very closely to players.. Trust me Cygames is easily the best developer around for gacha games.. generous and responsive. Hella fun, give it a shot!",5
"This game is absolutely incredible. The stirage space on a small phone like mine may be hard yo work out, but its all worth it in the end. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game.",5
fun but wish giant arrow wouldn't block view of the enemies lol,5
"The game won't even load. It keeps saying ""This device is not authorized to play the game."" when I try to open it.",1
"Fun gameplay, easy to not whale, murder on the battery tho",4
"I really like this game. F2P friendly, always something to do if you play co-op, solid graphics and sound, nice character design, always being updated, fun gameplay mechanics.",4
"Fun game, but I had to uninstall it because it needed over 3 GB of free space I didn't have for a simple update. Sticking with FEH instead.",4
"100MB download from google play, 1GB download after you launch the game, and then after a 10 min tutorial gameplay section you get another 1.5GB download. after all this, you notice that english voiceovers are only partially voiced so you choose to use Japanese to find out it's another 400MB. Then when you start playing the game, it needs to download even more for the story which you download them all in the options for another 2GB. So in grand total, this game is 5GB. Good job.",1
awesome game just takes a good while to load,5
ever since last update been crashing every 10 minutes please fix,3
Amazing!,5
so far perfect.,5
really fun game. love the story and the characters,5
good game,5
"Dropped all gacha I was playing for this, truly number 1 gacha game on Google play",5
awesome absolutely love this game,5
"every other stage is just a story and the actual fight stages you need to download every single time and there's a story there as well. Too much nonsense to get to an actual fight and the fights are fast and easy, there needs to be changes imo.",2
Make it an anime asap,5
a nice game.,5
i like the story the control are easy and it is just really fun 😊,5
my only prob is my phone memory thats all but overall awesome game,4
"This is a well done game. The controls are easy, but do require skill to master. The story is phenomenal! The graphics are praiseworthy. Great Job!",5
"Cute characters, interesting gameplay, generic but decent story for a gacha. Pretty good so far!",4
Many game Such Animoo Sword/10,5
Underrated game.,5
fun and easy to get into,5
Galan here! Everyone who works on this game has done a fantastic job so far! It's very engaging and comes out with new things quite often. I especially like how they listen to our feedback seriously and implement changes based on it. They are also extremely generous when it comes to gifts which is not typical of most games. I hope this game continues to grow and gets better with each new update. Btw the Fire Emblem update was literally the best thing EVER! DO IT AGAIN! PLEASE!,5
wewest of wews.,5
Good Game,5
"Easily the best gatcha game ever. Only way it could be better is to also be on the Switch. Make it happen, Nintendo. Spinoffs also acceptable.",5
This is the first time playing this app! (reccomend to download),5
"An incredibly generous gatcha. The developers actively listen to and implement feedback and requested QoL features. Interesting character designs and a fun, active combat style that emphasizes different weapon types.",4
"Yes, the game has a few large downloads but once you get past that you get to play this incredibly fun game. I was worried it would end up 'pay2win' but I've played for 2 months & still having fun playing for free. The game offers LOTS of rewards to help you get 5* characters. The Co-op feature is my favourite part, I can team up with a friend to complete harder quests. I also love the character stories and appreciate being able to play with real anime voice actors! Thanks Nintendo!!!",5
exceptional!,5
Good experience so far. Very fun,5
great game!,5
the game is very fun,5
very fun game,5
"Surprisingly fun, didn't think it was my style of game but it proved me wrong. 4.2 is definitely the wrong score for this game, should be higher.",5
So fun that there arent words to explain it! (At least not right now),5
Fair game with generous developers.,5
awesome,5
"Great game for me so far. They are adding more story, events, and summons. The rewards are alright and don't really make you wanna buy stuff since summons are fairly frequent with many ways to earn currency for new summons.",5
very nice,5
This game's fun but I'd love to be able to play it without having to wait 5 minutes to download an update every i play it.,3
"kinda repetitive and boring gameplay, nice art though. confusing for someone that didnt play grand blu",3
amazing 😍,5
Excellent game to pick up and play. Devs are great and the community is fun!,5
I love playing this game But since the up date the game will not start please fix it thanks,5
"Best one out there currently. Tons of adventurers, Dragons, and ways to advance. Great writing and excellent music by DAOKO! Features quality English and JP audio",5
"Constant QoL updates makes this great game even better. They balanced heavy grind with 2x speed, improved AI, better drops, etc. The co-op is the real gem of this game. Difficult MMO style bosses where you need to strategize and work together with three other players to defeat it. The lack of PvP actually encourages a friendly atmosphere. The developers even improved the gacha. They removed wyrmprints from the pool and dropped the summon cost from 1500 to 1200. I highly recommend playing this.",5
Excellent game so not play fire emblem heroes that is big bad game,5
"I use to enjoy it,.till my data got deleted. but the dragalia lost support team helped me get it back. words cant describe how thankful I am for their support. Be sure too link your account to a Nintendo account so what happened to me doesn't happen to you.",5
awsome,5
"LOADS of loading, small maps, not a very good game. Looks better in trailers. 3DS weaker system gets you better games than this. Shame, I had loads of hopes for this, very sad.",3
Outside of massive downloads the game is incredibly fun.,4
The most player friendly mobile game I have ever played. It is luck based for certain characters but the entire game is viable with even the common ones and you are literally never required to spend money to beat any content.,5
The most generous gacha.,5
awsome.,5
With every Daoko song that gets added I grow stronger,5
They always improve every flaw and they listen to the players. The most f2p gacha game you'll ever play. Thanks to cygames.,5
good,3
So far one of the best f2p friendly Gacha ever! So many goodies. That's a plus side. Gameplay is very fun which is the main point.,5
"Dragalia Lost loves its players, for it's generous in the realms of quality, detail, music, content, responsiveness to feedback, and most of all, wyrmite, their in-game currency.",5
thank u cygames very cool,5
This is a good game. A really good game. Go play it.,5
So far so good but will update as I delve deeper into the game.,4
A bit of lag but fun,4
great game,5
"Hella friendly gacha game, really generous to f2p so anyone can get right into the game. A lot of effort is put into the development of each unit and overall, really enjoyable game.",5
incredible game and Devs!,5
The game is really fun with a great storyline and fun characters. The summoning pool has great characters and not getting the rarest characters doesn't mean you automatically lose. The game is very F2P friendly especially with how generous Cygames is. You definitely won't want to miss out on this game. 100% world recommend.,5
Good Game,5
"other than the game file is too big, this is a great game.",5
love it!,5
"Doesn't work on emulators, connection failed. Lowen best boy tho~ :3",1
Easy to learn and fun to play!,5
"Definitely believe this game should have a higher rating. Playing for as long as I have with the account Libra has been really fun, in the past I had my ins and outs with summoning and eventually got some characters that I missed from old banners. Losing out on a banner I like to see at some points there will be another chance to try and the gameplay along with the growing story makes this really worth the time. I'm level 100 and can't wait to see the progression of the game continue.",5
"This game has it all! Not only is it free to play, but the graphics are stunning and the storyline is by far one of the best I've experienced in a long time. The developers listen to their audience and they work quickly to resolve any issues the game may have. The characters are unique and likeable, which is a huge plus! I never have enjoyed a mobile game such as this one. Thank you Dragalia Lost team!",5
Good fun.,5
"I really love this game! they listen to their fan base, give good compensation and keep updating the game with new material! it would be 5* but every time I've had to update the game so far, it's taken so much more memory. it started at 1.8 gb and right now it's approaching 5gb! I may have to delete it because it's taking too much space...",4
i like it. its fun,5
Very charming. Doesn't seem as unfair as other gatchas,5
The devs are very nice. 5 stars is too little.,5
This is probably the best gacha game out there. the amount of free stuff you get is amazing and you don't even have to spend a penny.,5
"The grind in this game is crazy. Honestly, it's great that there are events that give new characters and extra goodies, but if you want to get everything from an event, prepare to be grinding a few hours every day. This means if you have a life, you'll be missing out. Also, Nintendo had to put a cap on how much to charge for the microtransactions. Might give you an idea of how greedy these people are",1
cool,4
Love it 🐉🗡️✨,5
I love this game!,5
not a bad game.,4
very good,5
"It's a gacha game, but sometimes it doesn't feel like one because of how little it feels like it's making you pay money. It's a little grindy, but that goes for most mobile games nowadays. The developers also listen to the fans, and the plot is also pretty good.",5
i love the game. i have played tons of rpgs and this is a really fun game kinda cute to cuz they are all chibi,5
this game is amazing just that it takes forever to download the game but its worth the time,5
Great game so far! I understand stuff really easily and am progressing through the story easily.,5
awesome,5
Its been a wild ride,3
Probably the best gacha game experience around,5
Great game and very free to play friendly. Just understand when to pull on a banner and when you should save some resources.,5
This is a very fun game. The graphics are amazing. The summoning is very lenient for getting characters.,5
fun game,5
what's the point in downloading a 3GB game when every mission I have to download personally Nintendo really messed up this game is the worst,1
"it actually has a story! and they are serious about the background story of each event. not a pay to win. and the best part is, it is NOT pay 2 win type with low 5* card rate. highly recommended.",5
Best Game :3,5
"it looks like an amazing game but I can't even play it, it keeps on giving me a user authentication error when I haven't even played it before.",4
best game iv played on the phone,5
Nice,5
the game itself is very fun and very f2p friendly if that's what your into. the only reason that it's not a full five is that the game file size is rather large about 3.5 gig at last count and with no way to compress it atm,4
"Could use some better controls and less frames on movement to make it feel faster and more fluent, but is great nonetheless.",4
Really fun!,5
pretty okay so far,4
"I've played Gacha Games before and this does well to stand-out among the rest. The main reason why I have it an shot was because it was by Nintendo. Sure, disappointment as when you don't get that exact roll but the game is balanced in a way that anyone and everyone is useful. Events are on a regular basis and have plenty of things to keep you busy, all within the limits of your Stamnia and Getherwings (Resource for Co-Op play.) TL:DR Its a good game and is visually appealing. Would reccomend.",5
got it,4
surprisingly good for a mobile game,5
It's amazing Dragalia Lost will make you play it over and over with an awesome story of the protagonist and his allies. (Make a lite version),5
yes too much dowlad required though,5
only one problem with this game I see so far I'm level 16 with only 36 energy with this should be more so I can do more things in this game instead of having that short period of time and putting his game away,5
so good,5
"I would recommend this game to anyone who needs something do with free time. This felt like the most free mobile game that is very F2p friendly. I haven't felt like I had to spend money yet. If I do spend on this (which may be soon), it would be to support the devs. The only downside is that this game takes up a lot of space on your phone.",5
A great experience with generous and non-predatory devs.,5
top game.mad🔥🔥🔥,5
I really liked it at first story all of it... but like I've said.gaming is dead now.finance oppositions hasn't any1 learned since 2001? it can be far greater by far.!Keep making the same common mistakes.You focus on your needs far to much because of servers basically. but again I quit gaming as of this game. I'm glad to exit after playing. the normal characters every character calls weird and their imaginary lives was highly fitting to how the world works EQUALLY... reality or fantasy.thank you,5
summonings can be frustrating but over all it's an amazing game,5
super fun,5
really enjoying this more than kingdom Hearts union cross,5
this mobile game would be better if it wasnt on the phone like why isnt this on the switch my phone storage was easily over loaded as soon as i got past the prolog. it plays good enough for it be on the switch like why isnt on there only other app my phone has is discord and chrome,5
best and most generous gacha out there,5
Fun game,5
"The latest update broke my game and it was a blessing in disguise. Numerous attempts to get answers from Customer Service, only to receive a FAQ copy of the troubleshooting and veiled threat that they would not respond if I kept asking if they were working on the problem. They never asked me a single question related to my issue. If you haven't watched the recent Jimquistion video and are considering playing, I suggest you do first. It helped me to terms with quitting Gacha Gambling altogether.",1
I really enjoy this game. It's fun and easy to play but still is challenging enough to be interesting.,5
always uploading not much game playing,1
it's well polished,5
it is a very underated game. The game runs smoothly and the luck system is very forgiving and nice on new players. Or even returning players,5
game devs that actually listen to feedback and actively work towards the player base's satisfaction. definitely recommend if you're into gachas.,5
"I really enjoy this game, I have been playing it since it released and I have been stuck with it since, log in everyday without fail! I love the characters and how free-friendly it is! Also the staff always seems to know what I want to change in the game. It is a great gaming experience.",5
Good mechanics.,5
great game,5
Nicely Polished,5
"really really shallow gameplay, also just another gacha pay to win game zzzz ... i don't feel sorry for anyone dumb enough to throw money at this",2
"This is not a AAA title, but the attention to detail is unparalleled and it has only improved. The biggest problem you will face is the absurd players that mistake a suggested team strength for individual player strength. If one player exceeds the team requirement, then untwist your panties and start the mission. The only game issue is how redundant it gets when completing events, but the addition of 2x made this less tedious. The rates are decent and the story is heartwarming and well-written.",5
anime I love anime anime it's so fun to play,5
"4.2 is criminally low for this game. It's the most free to play friendly game I've ever been a part of, and I play a ton of mobile games. They listen to community feedback and make tons of improvements too and they've already messed around with different types of events to keep the game fresh and it's only been out around 8 months. This game is crazy good and everyone should try it",5
"A pretty good action RPG. The gacha mechanics are unobtrusive and you get a fair amount of currency to get more characters/dragons. plus, they give you enough characters over the course of the story mode to have a full battle team. I have spent $2 in total on this game over the course of a year, but I only spent it to test the premium currency. It's more efficient to just play the game. Multiplayer is co-op only, so you don't have to worry about someone burning your castle down.",5
Being able to reroll gachas is a feature that should be in any of these types of games. I definitely love the combat and different art styles of the game and constant progression of the story.,5
"the fact I'm giving this a review in the first should be reason alone to play the game. sure it's not the most in depth game there is. combat is simplistic, but Cmon dude...theres dragons XD and dragon waifus and for those interested dragon husbandos as well",5
slow loading in any device too much extra data and quick fights..... the rest is good,3
"Fantastic gameplay, amazingly generous developers, and likeable characters. Story is ongoing and honestly a bit slow, but I have no complaints when it comes to how well Cygames has treated their players.",5
"I have had this game since it first came out, and I have not grown bored at all. I love the characters and stories. the creators also take care of any issues that arise asap.",5
"Best gacha game I have ever played, I should have downloaded this game sooner. It is F2P friendly and respects their customers which is very rare to find.",5
It just doesn't feel too much of a Mobile cash grab when you play it. It's freaking amazing.,5
Its fun and stuff tbqh,4
"def a grinding game, but you dont have to pay to win",5
"Imagine playing a gacha game and complaining about bad rolls LUL. This is probably the best gacha ive played, the developers actually fix issues in the game and are responsive to the community.",5
"Best game out of Cygames since GranBlue and Nintendo's only good game. Dragalia is an amazing game with solid game play, a great story, funny characters and amazing dialogue. Only issue I have is 99% of the dub actors are random Canadians so the quality is nowhere near what FEH delivers. Otherwise it's a great game and needs an anime just like Gran Blue maybe this time two seasons instead of one.",5
"grate game just wish i didn't have to start all over after deleteing it, i got it to help a freand, freind had a falling out, i loose everything because i needed space and didnt want to be reminded of said friend, cool right? so far thats the only problem with it i have, grate game none the less",4
"new phone,more space.can finally have this and Fire emblem. i am depressed, this is how fire emblem heroes should be like....",5
games gone bad,1
good game,5
best gacha game ever,5
It's good.,4
Zygames and there crossovers waiting to see what next,5
only flaw is more daily things to do. like questing or arenas....more chapter quests faster.,4
This game is amazing but my only complaint is that is takes too much memory.,3
love this game it is a game you must-try,5
Great,5
great game with an awesome story.,5
"nice controls, doesn't feel too overbearing, neat character models, the only downside I've discovered is all the downloads you need to proceed through the chapters.",5
Removing prints and reducing summon costs were great improvements. Still not comfortable with the control scheme and the grind to power up characters is a little ugh. Overall not bad at all.,3
GOOD,5
its ok,5
"This is actually a fun game. but the community for the game however, not so fun. just don't join their discord or facebook page. the people on those are kinda harsh. but the game itself is fun.",3
this game is effing AWESOME!! I HAVE NOT FOUND A GAME WITH THIS GOOD OF GRAPHICS AND STORY LINE TILL NOW,5
amazing,5
a genuinely good game that doesn't require you to buy premium currency to progress,5
Fun fun fun worth the download time,5
"Very fun, addictive game. Love the story, the characters, and the music.",4
"I fell hard for this game. It's got tons of charm, and it plays pretty well. The gacha itself is similar to other games but it never feels like you need to shell out a lot of money to enjoy.",5
"The stroy is pretty good, characters are cool and I think it connects to the real world a little bit actually.",5
great songtracks,5
"Becoming more fun and exciting, keep up the good work",5
This is a great rpg! This should definitely be a anime!,5
"it's been nearly a year since I've been playing, and it's been amazing. The reputation the the dev team gets is understandable. Having the developers listen to the community's feedback and actaully act on it is some times rare in not only gacha games but app games in general. Very enjoyable. 10/10",5
Exactly what I wanted!,5
The RNG in this game will heavily affect your enjoyment and it is kind of on the lacking side. Also getting gems for aummoning units is very slow near the end which brings the game to a grind.,4
Best high qualitly gotcha on google play hands down.,5
"The game is really fun! At first, the menus seem very cluttered, but things start to make more sense the more you play. Incredibly F2P friendly with a great sense of progression",5
great,5
At the first time I tried this game | I didn't even get to play the game! the loading screen takes so long! It looks like might take hours. When I downloaded it again I FINALLY get to play the game.,4
it's a solid game and i put that on the fam,5
"smooth game,as you would expect from Nintendo.",5
awesome.,5
"great game, frequent improvements, and f2p friendly",5
Is good,5
Fun game. Amazing Dev team.,5
Amazing,5
"This game is pretty good, I enjoy the real-time rpg and the growth of strength in the characters not being based just on its level, the Mana Circle System as well as the dragons, weapons and Wrymprints are a fresh of breath air to me, the controls are okay, might need to get used to them since its not where you tap that indicate where you strike but where your character us facing. I adore this game.",4
i like the dragon stories.,5
enjoyable,5
A great causal and grinding game depending on how you play it Great template so not to feel super crowded as the game doesn't do with too many mechanics and items of limited use,5
"absolutely love this game. adorable characters, great story line, and over all a lot of fun... it's very addicting as you are always trying to unlock new characters and dragons!",5
good game,5
great,5
Dragalia Lost is incredible!!! love this game and everything about it. I recommend it to everyone who wants a fun and engaging game.,5
not bad so far,5
very addictive and very fun. Not at all pay to win.,5
Amazing game. Graphics are good and cygames is extremely generous with premium currency.,5
couldn't even get pass the first hour. i have a pretty good tablet but even with that its struggling to lode smoothly plus all the models are completely blank. i was told to play this because I love fire emblem heroes and if I could get this to run right then I may like this as well but intill then it's 1 star,1
Gameplay runs smooth on my mid-range smartphone (Galaxy A5 2017) and always has since release. Gacha rates are more than fair. Even as a free to play player this game has easily become my favourite.,5
one of the best mobile games ive played in a long time,5
"the graphics glichted for me, the sprites were all pure black and the cutscenes would often have static noise over sprites, run at about 3 fps, or just freeze and force me to skip. i didnt go past the tutorial as the game asked me to download 1.5gb more data that i didnt have. anyway, the game play and controls were pretty fluid, if i ignore the glitching",3
"Game is super fun with great mechanics, graphics and music. But the game itself has many bugs that it needs to fixed. Currently I cannot even open the app without it crashing, which can be super frustrating. Until the game fixes these bugs, I cannot recommend others to start this game.",2
super fun game,5
I LOVE THE GAME!The only thing i dont like is it takes a wille to downloud the data.,4
repeated boring ingame event,1
User friendly gacha game with the greateet developers.,5
"very cute, love it.",5
"Dragalia Lost is an insanely fun and addictive game! The devs are constantly supporting it with new updates and content, too, so you won't be wanting for things to do. Perhaps the only downside is that the monetization is a tad more pricey than I would like. That being said, there are constantly great deals as well, so I really can't complain, especially since each new update also usually comes with gifts from the developers.",4
Loved this game. I've had it installed since day one. But recently I unexpectedly had to switch phones and the game made me start from scratch. Please help me restore the game or I will have to stop playing entirely. I refuse to start over after losing all progress.,1
good,5
",👿👿👿👿👿👿Bugs,it is spoiled!It said i had no connection when my connection was excellent!Fix this now!",1
incredible,5
its ok,5
Great game,5
My #1 favorite gacha game,5
"One of the best games I've ever played. It's a gacha, but spending money isn't necessary. I personally spend to support the game",5
cool,4
incredible project this is,5
fun,4
"easily the best gacha game on the market, other games you eventually need to spend money to progress or keep up with other people, but plenty of people have been playing this game since launch, and are able to keep up with people who are spending money. Play this over playing Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost was better at its worst then Fire Emblem Heroes ever was at its best",5
Good combat and story,5
"Easily one of the best, most generous, and most rewarding mobile gacha games I have ever played. Sure, at launch, it had its fair share of issues, but the developers have been constantly on top of all user feedback, and the game has seen updates and improvements by leaps and bounds in less than a year as of writing this. As a Day One player that has been on pretty much every day, I can't recommend Dragalia enough, especially as it keeps getting better and better.",5
"Great game with great devs that listen to our feedback. Day 1 player here, and the QoL improvements they've made are absolutely spot-on. Only time I'm not playing this game is when I'm out of stamina.",5
"A wonderful game developed by a team known for their incredible support and relationship with their fanbase. Game's offer really good writting, great character design, fun co-op and both easy and challenging events. The only valid complain would be the gacha rates, but not having rare units offer no impact in gameplay as they are not needed in any time-limited event, instead it requires individual grind. (And even then, one of the two end-game content can be done with free resources).",5
"fantastic game! I dare say the best gatcha game I have ever played! it has some of the best action combat on mobile I have ever seen. I have been relatively disappointed with action games in mobile, but Dragalia Lost does not disappoint! the story is good, but it's relatively short, they need to work on that. the gatcha elements are very tame, they actually had an update that made it much less frustrating and it is the kindest to f2p gatcha game I have ever seen. I wholeheartedly reccomend.",4
exceedingly well animated,5
"I have played since the first month of the release and I'm very happy with this game. My favorite things are how thoughtful and proactive the Dragalia Lost Team and Cygames have been. They have always looked for ways to improve the gameplay experience, as well as heed what the players have to say. Also, I love the graphics quite a lot and how much diversity there is; from hard content to more relaxing playing experience, as well as how frequent new events-well-designed- appear and soundtracks!",5
"Gameplay seems decent, but menu is cluttered, and this game feels like it should be horizontal instead of vertical for hand comfort.",3
The game is very easy to understand and the gameplay is challenging yet understanding. The quality makes it more life like and inspires a persons imagination.,5
"The developers just keep giving free and QOL uodates,one of the best gacha games out there right now!",5
Fantastic,5
Amazing gameplay. Fun characters. Top notch music. Focus on co-op multi-player with some decent challange. Very F2P friendly,5
nice bro! Excellent game easy control perfect!,5
"Great game, run by a great and generous developer. Very free to play friendly and a ton of fun to play. Best gacha on the market!",5
"Still playing it since release, still a awesome and fun game.",5
"It is the same mobile game with nothing to differentiate between its competitors. It has the little farmville element, the gatcha element, and daily log in bonus. It is backed by Nintendo this making it a very polished bland experience. More fun then most.",3
Dragalia is a delightful experience with excellent quality art and music. The game continues to get better with each update. My number one gripe with the game (wyrmprints being in the summon pool) has since been addressed by Cygames and have been removed from the paid summons! This developer listens to player feedback and is continually working to make Dragalia more enjoyable. This is far and away the best mobile game I've ever played.,5
"this games developers really care about there player base, it's really great",5
"A simple but enjoyable hack and slasher with remarkably excellent localization. A lot of Cygames' strengths on display, with relatively few of its weaknesses.",5
This game is stellar blew my mind with its great story and free to play aspects.,5
absolutely loving the game i hope to see more improvements.,5
"Horrible 5 star summon gacha system. An engaging 2-3 minute gameplay looter lite dungeon crawl loop. Good use of multiplayer. 2D art is better than 3D character models, grating vocal tracks can thankfully be turned off. Story leaves a lot to be desired, lot of untapped potential. A lot of content; your fun will vary by your attachment to the characters you summon via low drop rates.",4
"This gacha RPG gets a solid 10/10 from me. The devs are on point with their quality of life updates: from implementing new mechanics and gameplay to improving the exisiting crafting and UI elements, these devs show that they truly care about this game through these constant and frequent updates. The game is also pretty generous with free gifts and makes a solid f2p experience realistically possible. If you start playing be sure to visit the subreddit for tips and memes!",5
i honestly love the gane the only thing i dislike is most of the game is hidden behind a pay wall,4
"Good game with fun story and easy to play. Only one thing that could be fixed. I've done 30+ summons, two having been a tenfold summon and did not get any 5 star. Normally you would get at least one but I haven't gotten any for the last two events",4
"I want to enjoy this game, I really do. But the game makes it so hard to enjoy . Everything in DL needs upgraded and I mean everything. Each character needs leveled, so does their weapon, dragon, mana circle, and both of their wyrmprints(equips). Then each of these have their own rescources too. Everything beside the character needs Unbound too. So you need 5 of each dragon, wyrmprint and weapon. Its just so much work with little to no reward at the end of it. 500 letters isnt enough space..",2
This is so far a rather pleasant surprise of a game.,5
good,5
"This Game Is Huge! After only three in game chapters, this game is 3 GB plus. On the second graphics setting. I enjoyed what story I got, until I ended up with only .5 GB left on my phone. Please work on your file sizes! FEH is only 2 GB! Also, why would there be a download for every battle? This would make a good free console game, and it may be better that way. story + size - gacha box fairness + gameplay + graphics + too many downloads -",4
awesome and intuitive,5
Great game really ftp friendly,5
"Great game. It has very high production values and is actually f2p frienly so far. The game had a lot of problems early on, but the developers have fixed every complain the player base had and then some. Would recommend to anyone looking for an great mobile game for a change.",5
"literally unplayable, locks me on home screen claiming internet issues that don't exist",1
Cygames doing a great job,5
amazing game just kinda a big file ar 3.4gb,5
"Fun game, just so much downloading",4
Best Mobile Game,5
"One of the most generous ARPG gacha in existence. The start is pretty easy, like every other game of this type, but the endgame boss fights are fun and challenging. One of the few gacha games where your skills actually matter, instead of just your character's stats.",5
"i like the game,nice story nice action rpg mechanics and no idle nonsense. waiting for the paywall...",5
I can really tell these developers care. highly recommend,5
"I absolutely loved this game. It has so many things to do, it is SO exciting, it is very cute, and the art style is quite interesting. However, I did give it 3 out of 5 stars due to the fact that it takes up so much space. It was slowing my phone down, and I can no longer enjoy it.",3
abandonedware,1
"Probably the best game I have ever had on Android. HUGE install size, but well worth it. I play daily, and have over 100 characters so far. Each one has their own reasons for fighting, which they tell you through story bits you earn. Plenty of side quests and an intensive grind if you intend to battle some of the games highest trials. The best part, is that unlike most gatchas, Dragalia rains resources on you all the time. Money can speed some things up, but it is not required to enjoy it.",5
"it's so smooth if ,you batch download",5
"Generous gacha game with beautiful characters. Co-op is enjoyable. The main issue I have is with connection problems, for example I always get disconnected from the host in co-op against raid bosses, and for every loading screen I get a ""Failed to connect to server"" message and I have to press cancel to take it off every time.",4
"This game is a pure masterpiece. With probably the greatest gameplay I've seen in a mobile game as of yet, and many characters, while somewhat similar in it's summoning mechanic to Fire Emblem Heroes, this game will keep you going for ages.",5
"A great game that's fun to play in downtime. although the game has in-app purchases, I give full credit to the devs for balancing it so well that they feel fully optional, unlike many mobile games.",5
I love it!,5
"So far it's a fun game with great graphics, story, and content. I love that it allows me to download individual quests when it's time to play them, rather than having to download them all at once.",5
"This game is incredibly fun and addicting, and is probably what I would call the definition of easy to learn, hard to master. By far one of the most interactive gatchas on the market with the entire cast being usable to boot, be they 3 stars or 5 stars. The near constant showering of free currecny and vouchers is also very generous. It may be a giant storage eater, but this game is worth your time if you give it the chance!",5
This is suuuuuper! I really love the game. No more words.,5
Enjoyable,5
i really love this game and have been playing since release and the devs always try their best to fix any problems 10/10.,5
it's fun,5
Top Tier Gacha game.,5

"I've loved this game since the first hours since it launched, but I'm getting scared the app is only a few hundred megabytes but the data that has been downloaded for the game has reached all the way to 2.92 gigabytes to keep the game I keep sending it to my SD card but how much longer will I be able to play I have just under a a gigabyte left Google says that I have 0.92% left of memory before it's full, so to the team and creators I love your game and I love Playing Granblue Fantasy as well but if there's not an English site for fully registration for GranBlue Fantasy then when it comes down to which one will take more priority over the other I really don't have a heart to part with either but someday I will in order to make more room for the other game. Now for those reading down to this part you're thinking well why not get another phone but that's just it I could but I don't have the money and if I did how could I retain all my progress with Granblue Fantasy if I had to give up this phone in order to afford the other phone, the solution if there was a English dedicated version of the game for registration then all the English users would be able to upgrade their phones and continue to love and honor the game along with this great game from the same team Cygames!!!",5
this games its AWESOME!! so addictive love the storyline and amazing animation Love it so much.,5
Awesome . If it's on Nintendo gotta get it then !,5
Dragon is good.,5
It's a good game but it takes up to much storage then I had to delete it,4
fun from the start,5
"amazing game, love playing it during my spare time!",5
awesome! just awesome! 🤩🤩🤩,5
It is really fun and the fact that you can turn into a dragon is just UGGGHHHH! I just love it.,5
great and fun game!,4
Great game so far. Good Boss fights. Amazing graphics. Only annoying thing is the constant need to download extra parts for each level would be better if you could download it all in one go. Also a solo offline mode would be a bonus.,4
"Excellent game. Great fun to play, extremely generous for a gacha game, awesome music. My singular complaint is that it's a massive app, which might be a problem for devices with low internal memory.",5
can not play co op at all everytime i try to join a room or create one amd start it disconnected from server i have 99 wings i cant do anything with....,5
"Very good, especially the grind, ten out of ten would like a single 5 star shadow dragon please, or even the shadow bow lady. Is this too much to ask for.",5
BEST GAME EVER,5
great time super fun,4
This is a very polished and well designed Gacha Action game. Cygames is very generous in giving out rewards and creating exciting event and content at a consistent basis. Nintendo ensures the monetization is fair and with quality control over the game. Game is focused on team building with different elemental dmg in play. You will require teams of all 5 elements to progress therefore there is always something for you to build on. Game runs extremely well with great stylized artwork.,5
good game to many things to keep up with,4
"Extremely fun game, gacha is fair and devs constantly listening to the playerbase, new content being added all the time.",5
best Nintendo game ever.😄😄😄,5
great game!,5
If only only it worked. in the begining where it has to download it always crashes and i need to reset my phone. please fix this. no offense but i want to enjoy the game not the loading screen,1
the game is fun but the amount you have to download is insane. basically any time you do something new you are looking at a several minute download. great game poor execution.,2
Dragons. five stars,5
"Thus far this game has been absolutely awesome! I dont Expect anything less from Nintendo but it is a phone game. I love how they aren't constantly slapping me in my face with microtransactions, The story has me intrigued, a perfect amount of reading and voice over. So much going on and I dont even need to turn my screen. great work Nintendo and Cy. I'll keep playing, I'll be Back Review Station 🤔🤔😋",5
Spectacular! Really smooth gameplay.,5
"I used some wymite and tickets to get some summons and several times the game glitched, costing me 4 summons. I got nothing for those mess-ups (I checked for changes) and I can't get payments back.",2
nice music,5
"fun so far,easy to play",4
great game for what it is..,5
"Day 1 player. Still playing, extremely generous game.",5
fun just sucks i had to restart from step one,4
best game,5
F2P friendly on another level. The developer showers the players with in game currency. Its such a breath of fresh air to buy packs becuase you want to reward the company for how much they give you as opposed to being nickle and dimed for everything... looking at you SmileGate😒,5
anime is trash and so am I,5
fun things are fun,5
Level 33 so far and like this game. it has lots to offer but not too demanding. plenty of fun for ftp or purchases. Highly recommend this if you're sick of greedy and annoying developers who are just put something out. This is the first 5 star rating I have given because of many things. Thanks for putting out a game that is truly enjoyable by everyone.,5
Its been fun for the first hour,5
A great game!,5
I'm enjoying it.,5
got cool bird day one 10/10,5
I have nothing bad to say this game is awesome,5
great game,5
Best one of these type of games I've played,5
"Fun, great artstyle, and its grindy, but I don't mind grind. Developers are friendly and are active with updates, also receptive to feedback. Pull rates are low, but not a bug deal as most units are viable.",5
"The gameplay feels nice, the graphics are good, just tired of the whole ""pay money to get more heroes!"". then we are dealing with having different quality heroes, duplicates, etc.",3
👍👍👍,5
"I love this game. However, I can't transfer my progress to my phone since my Nintendo account ""already has save data"" so I can't link it.",1
2 sneaky in game downloads put this game at almost 3 GB. So I decided to just get it over with and batch download. It's a cute game and fun to play but not worth the nearly 7 GB of space it takes up on my phone. TAC has just as good rendering and multiplayer yet comes in at just under 2 GB after batch so I don't understand how devs let such a simple little game get so ridiculously huge.,3
"This is like Bleach: Brave Souls but better in every way, this is amazing, thank you!",5
"4/10 gaming, 0/10 for CONSTANT updates",2
"I love this game. In my case, combat takes a backseat to the lore (and soundtrack). Each and every character/dragon you obtain has their own unique journey, and I often find myself completing tasks just to get another slice of backstory. The combat system is fast-paced, fun and engaging, but the stories are what I'm really after. It's obvious that a lot of time, effort and love went into making this game, and I don't plan on putting it down anytime soon.",5
"love the game, the story is so interesting and controls aren't hard to master. I love how much I get to summon in the beginning due to all the giveaways. its Brill I haven't needed to spend a penny yet. but if I did want extra adventure items they aren't to bad a price. great game guys, well done!",5
Nice,5
"The game has such a cute charm to it, and I love the comics!",5
"Spectacular art design and overall gameplay, worth a try! Might not be for everyone but its definitely for me.",5
"Dragalia Lost is a phenomenal take on the gacha game genre. I've played since release with no sign of stopping. Beautiful controls, awesome combat, great story, real-time co-op, all topped off with an amazing and communicative dev team? Best mobile RPG to date.",5
Fantastic story and wonderful characters. A good game if you want to get lost in another world for a while.,5
This game is interesting.,5
Soild game,5
So many good changes in every update. These devs are the actual best!,5
I love this game it have Dragons,5
Normally not a fan of mobile games but this one just has so much polish to it that I can't stop playing. The devs are super quick to fix problems and they're very generous with giving out premium currency.,5
"My opinion about this game changed after playing 2 months, the game got stale after the repetitive grind/bosses and vicious gatcha. Fixing these problems should have been adressed earlier but it's too late for that. Plus your MC is a generic AF soyboy, see ya!",1
hard to control your character,3
Fun,5
the only gacha game that has ever impressed and engaged me,5
"The game is fine... but you couldn't optimise the size a little more? Downloaded the game, then the in-game installer needed to download another 900MB. Sure. Did that, played the introduction. Then I get prompted to download another 2.3GB. That 900MB was JUST for the introduction?!",3
Quite fun,5
Fun game,5
Super coll,5
thanks man,5
"Very user friendly and fun, very much looking forward to playing more in the future",5
This is a fun game the controls are simple and the progression is smooth,5
it's quite nice,4
amazing game guys,5
"Really good game, was hooked on it on the first few minutes, and still playing a few days later... **FOR THOSE STUCK ON THE CO-OP LOADING BUG ON ANDROID, TURN OFF POWER SAVING AND IT SHOULD WORK** yw",5
"Love the story! but moving your character around is a little difficult if you have big, wide fingers, and i wish there was a way to summon for specific elements if you need them (i just got to the light element area and don't have any dark element units besides cleo, a healer). also, some of the female character designs are...well, the side of my brain that hates sexualization of women in video games is fighting the side of my brain that says ""i like ladies, yes"".",4
gg,5
"Fire Emblem Heroes Banner. 378 summons ($1089.8), 14 5*, so its around 3.7% rate. Among them are 3 Marths and 2 Fjorms, 0 Veronica. 3 rainbow wands appeared among the 14 5*s, got Lily, Maribelle & Lucretia (all 0.062%), no Veronica (0.5%). Someone needs to do the math for this unlucky string of events to actually happen. Didn't pull on the premium banner as I'll get another Marth/Fjorm instead of Veronica anyway, so I'm saving myself from further disappointment. I'm done with the game.",1
i played the prologue thing and it was super fun and the story looks amazing and the voice acting to but it then takes a download which is really big my phone can't handle it please make this game for pc so i can play it,3
😎,5
not usually into mobile games but this one is pretty great.,5
nice,5
Way too much on downloads.... Period,1
"The game is very polished, and the user interface is modern compared to other mobile games. While you can get a lot of in game currency during events, this is still a gacha game, and you might never get the character you want. However, there is a large cast of characters, and with enough effort (grinding), you can use lower tier characters to clear end game content. Gameplay: this is an action rpg, not turn based. The developers are great, always listening to players and improving the game.",5
Nice devs thanks for giving me my 5 star that i got from summoning by the way. Ohhh wait you didn't.... got it.,2
this is a great game,5
fun,5
The music for this game is better than most console games!,4
Major P2W mechanics. Very skipable.,1
"Great game, been playing every day.",5
so far so good real great start,5
good stuff,5
"It's kind of fun for a little bit, but the extremely low chances of drawing any good characters and the amount of effort needed to get summon tickets/gems (whatever) without paying makes the game suffer. The gameplay is fun at first, but it will get stale quickly as combat relies very little on strategy or skill. Graphics offer very little in terms of innovation, relying on lazy chibi-style character models to convey action. The actual artwork ranges from very good to decent enough.",2
"The game is simple. The best part about the game is it's soundtracks. They match the gameplay perfectly. Even they are good to be listened alone. Very well done! And please, help me to thank Daoko, the singer for this game!! =)",5
Both the game and the companies are nothing short of amazingness.,5
"I really like the game, but this last update froze everything and now I'm stuck on the campaign screen. I should try to reinstall, but that's kind of a lot of effort. It's good and playable on my PALM smartphone.",4
"I love this game. Definitely one of the best mobile experiences to be had out there. Developers really listen to community feedback, the game is gorgeous to look at, and the gameplay is simple but engaging. I'm a fan. My only complaint with the game is that I wish there were some way to 'aim' skill shots. As it stands you can't really do that. Beyond that minor complaint, I love this game and play every day. It's fantastic!",5
"A top tier game, honestly the best mobile game on the play store.",5
When they finally separated the wyrmprints from dragons and heroes then increased the material you get from duplicate 4 and 5* characters the f2p route has significantly improved,5
fun game,5
cute dragons!!!,4
it is amasing,5
"I enjoyed the game until the last upgrade, the game kept crashing, please fix it.",3
Awesome,5
Pretty good for a mobile game. Intuitive controls. A bit large in file size you will definitely need a few gb for it.,4
There's a lot of update and the dev actually listen to the feedback the community gives. Great game and you don't have to pay at all if you want to access high end content. Been playing for months now and I enjoyed every minutes of it.,5
I love the game,5
fun and easy to get into,4
little hard at first but I am getting the hang of it,4
"Fantastic game with an amazing development team. Player feedback is regularly incorporated into the game, and new content is constantly coming out. Great level of polish across the board, and a game that deserves every bit of praise it can get.",5
"Has only gotten better since launch. Developers who are open and listen to their players, no money needed to enjoy with plenty of in-game freebies, addictive and fun gameplay, fun for casual play and competitive modes for players looking for more challenge. Would highly recommend trying.",5
I love this game and Cygames. One of the best developers to listen to players requests for improvements on the game.,5
"I've only just started this game, but I've heard lots of good things about it from friends. I enjoy the soundtrack and it seems to be really good from what I've gotten into so far. Would definitely recommend.",5
I am amazed by this game and the game's store,5
"Amazing game, great controls and amazing Dev feedback to issues that may come up in game. Story mode is also very fun and the co op",5
best free to play action dragon Nintendo sacha game EVER,5
"Awsome art, design and music. there's been lots of changes in the game design that improved the game greatly. If you are a fan of ARPG, fast action and coop and don't mind the gacha factor in it - This game is for you. But it can be very grindly and time consuming later on. If you want to reach end-game contents, you might have to spend 2-3 months to get there. Pick your choices 🙃",5
Having to download every single time I want to play is way too annoying.,3
"Developers are very very generous, this is the best gacha I've ever played. Always something to do, and you don't need to pay for the best units each month. Would recommend to anyone",5
Yeah man,5
Cant even play the game. Connection error even though im connected to a wifi. May be bug or something is so pls fix.Or a lower quality settings pls,1
better than feh lol,5
eh gatcha,4
A very fun 3D Rpg game with beutifully animated 2D and 3D visuals with simple but fun gameplay. (Also Euden for smash bros),5
great game great story and character lots to do,5
BANG BANG BANG BANG LOVE HENTAI,5
i played this game so much till i got it on my switch,5
so far game play is good and smooth,4
"The AI in this game is absolute garbage. They would stand frozen during fights and they would eat the ""this move takes forever to charge but it will delete your existence if you stand there"" attacks. I would play co op out of frustration. Co op is literally the only reason why I didn't give this game a 2 / 5. Playing with friends is a giant pain in the butt. There isn't a convenient way to invite people into rooms. There's no in-game chat to whisper them your room ID nor is there an ""invite to room"" option. Weapon upgrading and crafting is a huge pain. I'm not even talking about gathering resources. The menus are all over the bloody place. Using a ""Force Attack"" is inconsistent. Kindly consider adding an attack button or something. I find myself holding down the screen only to find out I'm just moving instead. Besides that, I love this game. The voice acting is well done for both languages. The gameplay and graphics rub me in all the correct places. The sound effects and background music feel good. The gacha rate is bad but I never felt weak because there's always a correct way to mix the heroes, weapons, wyrmprints, and dragons. I only bothered to write this review because I like this game so much. Also, please let me use my S Pen.",5
"only downside, so far besides being super awesome... its a memory glutton threw and threw..great game, but make sure u got room for it.",5
"Downloading takes forever, it's insane. There is so many things that this game needs downloaded that I just gave up. It was too time consuming, and the worst part is that you can't leave the game when it wants to be downloaded.",1
aswome game,5
very nice game now that it's been updated so much,5
the best game I have played in years and if I could I would give it way more than five stars,5
su fun to play i dropped it a while ago but picked it up nd having a blast right now,5
"The art, music, voices, and overall game is great!",5
This game is like xenoblade,5
"The devs are very receptive to feedback and they constantly strive to improve the game to give us players a better experience every time. The AI could possibly dodge better than you now, the cost for doing dailies is reduced, QOL changes for co-op are added, and wyrmprints are no longer in the summoning pool. It's definitely my all-time favourite mobage and nothing could even come close to this.",5
"So far so good, feels really polished. Liking the voice acted scenes. The gameplay is smooth and everything flows well together! Also the dragons look siiiiiick. An adventure I'm looking forward to continuing.",5
like it,5
fun.,5
love it,5
"Good Graphics, catchy music and entertaining gameplay.",5
"such an amazing game, story looks amazing and gameplay awesome",5
Amazing game that isn't greedy. Fantastically well designed and beautiful.,5
"Great character design, voices, and design art. Keep up the great work!",5
I played the tutorial and left the game but i read reviews on Reddit saying it's way better than all gacha games. Hasn't been challenging yet but the controls are very intuitive,5
Amazing simple and easy to play,5
I wish more games are like this.,5
great game,5
"the game is great. just a little improvement on move sensibility, would be best",4
awesome game!,5
the game is great the story cool to,5
"Way better than I would expect from any other game! For people who enjoy hero collecters and good storylines, this is the game for you!",5
love it!!!!!,5
I like I got far in it and it's fun,5
Definitely the most immersive Gacha Game experience I have ever had,5
"Amazingly f2p friendly game, the graphics and gameplay are superb, would recommend this game to anyone.",5
"Honestly, the least scummy feeling gacha I have ever played",5
Best gotcha game I've played! they constantly throw resources at you to be able to summon and stay relevant. I have never spent money and dont feel handicapped at all! great game!,5
Great game remember when i first pre registered,5
"Fun, inputs respond well, and interesting storyline",5
pretty good,5
"Best gacha , best developers",5
"Download 1.5GB to get to ""play"" a small tutorial stage and after tapping screen a few times and reading some generic 14 year old boys written story for the game after which youre welcome to download 1.5GB more of this trash excuse of a game..If you're looking for a decent game to play save yourself some time and keep looking.",1
"Grand Bounty random rewards is UNFAIR. You clear Nightmare mode with a team but you don't get same rewards. It is very tough to clear, and it is very anti-climatic to receive junk items.",1
love the game but keep crashing,3
Finally coming to Canada. Great game with great devs for a very f2p gacha. Playing since the start and this is still my main game. If you like story and character interactions this is the best gacha for it.,5
"What a impressive game!Highly addicted,smooth gameplay great graphics!",5
"This is a very fun game. I liked the story, graphics, and controls. However, every stage needs to be downloaded separately which gets increasingly frustrating and annoying. it takes away from seamless playing and for this reason, I'm am uninstalling it.",3
Didn't thought it be this fun,5
"Such a solid game, graphics are smooth, controls are easy.",5
i love it,5
"Just minus 1 star for gacha salt, but otherwise the gameplay is great and the f2p is pretty fair.",4
"The raids are fun, but the game has barely any event variety, the characters are mostly generic, and until the Fire Emblem patch it had one of my least favorite gacha systems with stupid eldwater or wyrmprints occupying basically every pull. The Valentines and Fire Emblem events were slightly different which is good, but even then after playing the disappointing stories, I wasn't interested enough to continue with the events.",3
"love this game, gameplay is fun, developers are extremely generous, music is awesome, head tilting is super cute",5
Very F2P friendly and developers are constantly listening to players feedback and improving the game. Try it you will love it.,5
best gacha game well blended of skill n luck,5
Cute and fun!,5
First Game I really praise for mechanics,5
The gameplay is simple. Good graphics & good storyline. Have different kinds of events and cool summoning features recommend this game to all age.,5
Very good Nintendo we all love him we iranian❤️❤️,5
I love it but the game is constantly blacking out on me. it makes it pretty hard to enjoy playing it when I cant even see the screen,5
"Excellent and very hard-working game, you enjoy every second!!",5
Best gacha game I've played and kept playing. Started as a day 1 player and have been able to do all content with minimal investment over a half a year. I probably spent maybe 50-75 bucks and that's just on the pick your 5star summons. If you're looking for a fun F2P game with great devs look no further.,5
Best ftp game I have ever played,5
Perfect.,5
"still in the tutorial when it prompts for a review, but we'll see. so far seems very fun.",5
at least have different songs playing instead of the same one over again.,5
Really fun game and colorful to boot!,5
"Amazing soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, active combat. You really cannot ask for more. Now to wait till endgame, that is when you really see a game.",5
"Not so good, the event is almost the same and boring",3
cool beans,5
"Dragalia Lost is one of the most fun gacha games I've played in awhile. I'm still farely early in the game but it seems pretty F2P. The art, sound design, and game play are all top notch as well. If you enjoy anime-esque themed games I can strongly suggest this one.",5
"The game keeps closing unexpectedly when raiding, even on perfect conditions which sucks.",1
Best gacha game on the market. Responsive devs and fair gacha system. Gameplay in end game is fully on Wow style raid boss content. You can treat it like a casual game or a dedicated game you actually sit down to play for the end game challenge.,5
"Good game, except stuck in game once making a pact with the windwyrm and was about to upgrade the ability circle. game doesn't load have to uninstall it.",3
its fun so far,5
Nice!,5
"Such a fun game, it's fair to the f2p players as well.",5
fun!,5
good gacha i like,5
pretty fun so far.,5
"another great experience from Nintendo and cygames. a perfect gateway into mobile with it's easy to learn, hard to master stlye. characters and story are great. and with them coming in updates, the developers have enough time to come up with their unique personality. they also listen to the players. fixing problems the game has, and making the experience that more enjoyable.",5
new but so far so good,5
"An enchanting fantasy game packed with fast paced hack-and-slash gameplay, enchanting music, and quirky characters. Dragalia Lost is a fun RPG that has quickly become a breakout sensation due to the tireless efforts of its developers, setting a new gold standard for presentation and F2P generosity.",5
kinda download-y ....,4
Great Nintendo quality. Definitely worth a try.,4
great game so far,5
dank,4
"Interesting, good graphics and gameplay.",5
very good game and happily to stream it at twitch.tv/GamingCulture,5
really such a fast pace and interesting fame! it doesnt take up alot of times but yet it keeps me entertained during my off hours after work. really a fun game to distress. the developer is also very kind to give alot of items to help with the entire gaming experience. really superb 6 stars game!,5
"Good game , not pay to win and cool graphics and concept! 10/10",5
fun game,5
nice art and cheerful dragons!,5
Game is fun and music and art style is great. Developer's are extremely generous and on point with changes and adjustments that the community and players want.,5
"Best game I played, not like the other lames in China.",5
nice game,5
Gets boring after awhile. becomes super repetitive and lacks a variety of other things to do. If this game had some guild system and wars/pvp i would come back to this in a heart beat. this was the only game on my phone i actually enjoyed.,3
love it,5
Enjoyable,4
now this game is working again they fix the gacha,5
"The game is so much fun! I can spend hours playing it. I hear people complaining about the drop rate of characters/dragons and its basically true, but this game is very and I mean very generous with giving players free stuff. The rates are low, but the removal of wyrmprints in the summoning pool makes it easier to get dragons or champions. I had to restart the game several times until I was lucky to get several 5-stars in my free pulls. However the flow its so fluid and addicting!",5
great game it reminds me of rune story so much. it run smooth and plays great on my s10 and I cant wait to see what this game has to offer in future updates!,5
Fun,5
cute,5
"Wyrmite is too rare a commodity, social rewards run out too quickly, thereby forcing players to either buy diamantium or lag behind players that do to get stronger. Anyone who thinks otherwise apparently never ran out of wyrmite during a banner they liked. Controls are still a tad sensitive.",2
great game,5
"The best gacha period. Developer is very generous, beautiful character design, no pvp just co-op raid means peacefully helping each others, most importantly, devs really listen to the community. Thumbs up Nintendo and Cygames.",5
Super Awesome,5
"Seemed like a fun game. I was super stoked that you could turn into a dragon! Unfortunately, before I can go into any quests, I had to keep downloading the game after I already downloaded 2.5gb.... That's ridiculous! who wants to keep downloading after already downloading a massive file!?",2
it takes SO long to download every thing and also you have download it every time you get the game.,1
"I have been pretty lucky with the pull rates in this game so I am a little biased in my opinion, however the gameplay is really solid for a game of its kind. I have reccomended DL to multiple people and figured I'd leave a good review rating as well. Even if you dislike gacha games you should at least give DL a try.",5
The best Gatcha game you will ever play. The game play is incredibly fun. The devs are constantly adding major quality of life changes too.,5
"fun, engaging story with a nice battle system and interesting characters. Recommend.",5
"a really cute, fun rpg with a lot of content!",5
Great song Awesome game,5
free to play friendly,5
Great,5
Possibly the best game available on Android atm,5
"It is very good game and very simple, buuut it hard to get wyrmite in late game for me which is how i get characters, i got everything i pretty much need but the developers are always creating new characters like gala mym which i really want but i wont see her for a very long time, (hope they can add more wyrmite",3
I've been playing since last September. this game is too addictive and generous for a gacha game,5
love this game,5
Fun and interactive.,5
The only gacha game that really seems to care about its userbase,5
"Great game. I would give it 5 stars if it didnt crash so often. It also messes up loading, giving me a black screen but still functioning.",3
"This game is awesome! The characters are well drawn,Animation is very smooth, Captivating story,Events that help to advance your squad and the story, all elements of traditional mobile games such as the base building, multiplayer, daily items and story are well implemented and actually add character to the game. I literally can't wait for the next event or story chapter. Please make the next content update but also take your time as we all know that Nintendo are quality based.",5
great experience,5
love it,5
"Actually it's a great game. However, it will not work on the Huawai Mate 10 (or possibly because of EMUI). Actually the game does work - you just can't save your progress because the app always cancels any attempt to link to your Nintendo account.",4
its good,5
I've never seen a game with such horrible battle controls. Movement is just abysmal. Good character design though and interesting story.,3
Seems fun,5
oh i loved it so much！,5
"Well polished, amazing soundtrack, fun gameplay, Excellent overall.",5
worth it,5
real cute,5
"this game is amazing!! you can grind duengons and boss fights, or take a more relaxed approach. (Edit: this games multiplayer is great!) the best thing about this game is that you don't have to spend money to get the best stuff. everything is obtainable some way or another in game. 10/10 would recommend!",5
"koolbeans. Possible to optimize attack/Dodge frames, feel, timing and response.",4
it is a lot of fun and the art is great,5
This game is one best mobile games to download you are missing out on a unique experience 10/10,5
Really fun and simple,5
Great!,5
love it,5
yup,4
its a good game,5
"Nintendo, you have our hearts in the right place. Thank you for this tremendous game, and for not taking advantage of us consumer's time or money.",5
unexpected gem of a game. my first mobile game!!!,5
fun,4
"Gacha is better now, could be improved in other areas of the game.",4
the most awesome nintendo game EVER!,5
The music is so darn catchy.,5
good game easy to play and entertaining,4
Super fun with kind developers,5
great game,5
it is not bad if you like fire emblem hero's or bleach brave souls it's kind of like that,5
its hard to believe it's free,5
it is amazing game along with wonderful music and unique gameplay,5
Fun stuff,5
"Great game, amazing fix to the gatcha style appa by making the gameplay more than just ""tap the icons and stuff happens"" to something that closer resembles a game, my only complaint is that it does start to slow down progression a lot after a while, but that much is to be expected from any sort of mobile game.",4
it's good,5
👍,5
Love the gameplay of it,5
it's so much fun,5
看不懂1gb的容量是在大什麼意思的，感覺像是下載一堆無用的影片，好讓玩家無法刷刷首抽。這種機八機率還不讓玩家能輕鬆一點刷首抽，搞不懂營運是在想甚麼。比FGO糟的劇情，比fgo抗的卡池，呵呵。這遊戲創紀錄了呢。,1
Simple and easy to play.,4
eh,4
"Really F2P friendly, good combat and frequent raids, events and end game content",5
Good story line,5
"I would recommend playing this game only if you are deadset on f2p; the gacha system is abyssmal and you can easily drop $100+ and still not get the one character you rolling for. Otherwise the gameplay is fun if you like top-down hack- and- slash games, especially with friends. Once you clear all the main content expect to grind for a long while before you can gather enough resources to effectively pull for anything.",4
"Outstanding game that deserves more than 5 stars. The story, oh boy the story! This is possibly one of the best experiences you can have on gaming period! Manga included. Everyone has so much depth even the items and the most tiniest things. The soundtrack has become one of my favorite OSTs ever. The gameplay is smooth and fun with very high quality graphics. And this game is absolutely free to play as the devs constantly give out items and everything is fairly easy to get.",5
good game,5
"Its a great game, its Nintendo what do you expect, of course its good quality, the English voice acting is great",5
not worth the 3.3 GB of storage data and wow i had to download a total of 4.7GB really not even worth my time,1
"Redownloaded the game after I had to make room for it, but when I attempted to open it, there is nothing but a black screen with a dot in the middle. Will try to reinstall. If it doesn't work, I will be uninstalling.",1
this games summon rates are garbage I've dont 3 multi summons and got nothing gotcha games are dumb and this game is dumb,2
great game!!!!!,5
"Fun gameplay and good story, if it wasn't for all the lag I would rate it 5 stars but you can reduce the lag by turning down the visual settings.",4
Very enjoyable gatcha game filled with story and incredible polish.,5
"Cute, rhythm parts, nice gameplay and voice acting on top of an attention grabbng story",5
I've been having a lot of fun with the game. I stumbled across it after doing a lot of research on mobile games that I might enjoy and I haven't been disappointed. The characters are fun and the gameplay is engaging. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the story before I expand this review.,5
No 5 star drop....,1
Good action game with cute art,5
the events are released regulary and the combat is fast and simple. This game is F2P friendly.,5
"One of the best gacha games on the Play Store. It actually has gameplay, unlike similar games in the same genre.",5
!!!!!!!ok!!!!!!!,5
Crashes all the time,3
l really do love game like this!,5
Cygames and nintendo?! Granblue mixed with nintendo quality?! Such beauty!,5
"The gameplay is great, amd they dump currency on you to do summon, however, there's a serious lack of content late game. Theres a stamina system that you burn through. Im talking log in to do a couole dailies and its drained. You then wait hours for it to refill just to do a couple more quests. I'm about burnt out.",3
meh,1
nice game,5
Great game!,5
awesome game,5
"Devs are very responsive to mass feature requests, as they push new updages every 1-2 months. A lot of premium currency is given out as well, making the game very easy to play without reaching the classic mobile ""pay wall""",5
Boss,5
good stuff 🌞,5
lovely,5
it is good,5
Best developers! They listen to their fans and implement the change everybody wants!,5
i really like the characters and soundtrack.,4
Enjoyable and fun.,5
good game,4
3rd time's a charm,5
so good wish it was on switch,4
wickedly addictive!! fun fun fun and my dragon form is epic!!,5
It's a good game I just don't like how I have to download new stuff on each level,5
It's fun at start... after a while it gets repetitive :/ hope the company add more stuffs to do other than the same 3 quests over and over...and the summon rates are way too low.,5
looks really good so far,5
"I'm gonna be 100% honest, the original reason I installed this game is because of the FEH cross promotion. but now that I've played it, I can genuinely say it's one of my favorite mobile games",5
Amazing keep up the great work,5
it's great in every way minus two. The sheer amount of space required on iOS and android to get it is outright to much. 3 GB for a simple download or 5 to 6 if you batch download is way to much for a game that came out a few months ago. All that aside I'd rate it 5 but the space needed and the wonky controls is what brings the rating down to 3,3
"Not just a great action RPG. 7 months after release the developers have tackled pretty much every single complaint the community had. The events are fun and they are definitely generous for a gatcha game. Not just a little, I mean there's little reason to buy the in game resource. I have on occasion now but never out of need. I genuinely love this game and don't mind handing out some $ for 7 months worth of good game.",5
Fun game! really polished and easy to play!,5
An amazing game that has only gotten better over time. The only company I've known to do so many QoL improvements so quick based on community feedback and generosity show they really care about the game. Cygames is known for their high quality production and this mobage is a testament to how other companies should run their games! Partnered with Nintendo if you like action cute games this is definitely the one to try.,5
"Really enjoy the game. High quality artwork, intuitive and fun gameplay and overall I can see this game having a bright future. Long loading times are a problem, but the game itself is phenomenal!",4
Best mobile gatcha co op game currently on the play store. Simple to pick up and play with a challenging end game. Very F2P friendly with all characters being viable for most game content. Additionally the game constantly has new content without being overly focused on being P2W as its only PVE focused. If you like any combination of RPG or JRPG this is a game for you.,5
This game is amazing. Typical Nintendo with the funky music and awesome art style.,5
Fun! Dragons are cool!,5
"the game has become so much better. I am a returning player bc the FE collab, and am amazed to see all my concerns were addressed. great dev with open mind.",5
Gameplay feels much more satisfying than most mobile games! Performance is the only thing i think that could use improvement.,4
"nice art but gameplay isnt very smooth or challenging, and unless you have money to burn, you'll never get any of the nice looking characters. just another gacha game.",3
fantastic！,5
gatcha,5
great game,5
awesome,5
Surprised I didnt play long ago.,5
"it's awesome, at least so far for me. That music that constantly plays always makes me smile.",4
The amount of work and polish put in is amazing. That and the tales for the individual characters.,5
Perfection,5
Nice!,5
great respect for cygames,5
it's pretty good,5
too sexual even for an anime game,2
fun RPG game with likable characters. The writing is can be hit or miss.,5
not really my type of game,1
One of the better free to play games i have played.,5
Awesome,5
"The development team are truly generous. so often they give out free draws, currency, and restore items. They are clearly truly appreciative of their users and it is ultimately refreshing. I play a lot of mobile games but Dragalia Lost has the absolute best team behind them. I don't even usually mind if I do a pull for characters and don't get them anymore! They made the system so much better and really do listen to requests and criticism. Cute characters and story with fun gameplay.",5
so fun,5
Fantastic!!!!,5
HERE COMES THE GALA Mym TRAIN!! CHOOOO CHOOOO,5
Love this game. Really well done.,5
Great gameplay!!! interesting storyline!!! crazy 3D graphics!!! overall a good game!!!,4
"i think this game is lit, pls make more waifus",5
love the story and gameplay!,5
fun,4
great game,5
"This game is fun with very few problems that are noticeable from the start. Combat is simple enough with a relative amount of skill to clear ""end"" game content. This game requires a lot of active time, meaning you can't auto for hours and get material or something. There are skip tickets , which you can use to circumvent this problem in most cases. The only thing I don't like is that the game is 4-5 gbs. I would love to use just low settings and not have HQ textures on my phone at all time",4
Definitely derivative of a whole host of other mobile gamed but it is polished and fun!,4
love it!,5
"great concept, let's see where it goes from here",5
have ti wait,4
alot of fun,4
gunner,5
Dope,5
so far so good,4
Solid game play. Varied events and the devs are very generous. Personally love the Co-op community over traditional pvp games.,5
I used to play it. but now every time i press it. it keeps saying : error. 😭i reaaaaaally want to fix it but I don't know how. please help me guys.,1
🍓,5
"Cheesy music, childish looking characters.",1
i can t play this game every time u try to connect it says unstable connection maybe the time out us too low pleaze fix this i tried the stupid thigs such as reinstalling changing network etc but still nothing...,2
Best gatcha game ever. The game is very free to play friendly,5
awesome,5
Good game,5
"Dragalia needs to use some kind of compression, or at least allow users to selectively delete scenes. The game has exceeded 4GB with no way to move app data to sdcards. Ridiculous. Apps like Samsung or OnePlus Switch cannot backup Dragalia, therefore changing phones is a pain. It takes forever to dl this game even on wifi as fast as 200mb down.",1
"Great presentation, good music, but it feels a bit easy so far. Hoping it becomes more challenging in later chapters. Addendum: Updating this app is always a horrific nightmare.",4
"Gotta say, this games pretty addicting.",5
"devs are very generous, combat is fun and engaging for higher level content. wish I had more skip tickets for dailies though.",5
"Devs are dedicated to listening to the community and improving on an already great game. Since I've been playing over the last 2 months or so, it's gone from good to great with loads of things to do and QoL improvements. New heroes and dragons are quite frequent and the gacha element, while there, isn't anywhere near as ridiculous as other games in the same genre (there is loads given away for free)",5
I'll be straightforward. I love this game to bits.,5
很棒的遊戲，其他玩家要記得與任天堂帳號連動，要不然換手機或是重新安置會失去遊戲進度喔！（不要跟我一樣...）,5
it was a 4 but the developers really stepped up there game and made it a 5 lots of fun and revamped summon gate makes summoning worth it,5
"After 1.8.0 update, the lag is finally gone. Gameplay is fast and smooth. Thanks you Cygames. Changed rating to 5 🌟.",5
love the devs for this game.,5
This is a brilliant Action RPG with extremely generous and listen to feedback to make this game the best it can be!,5
♥️♥️♥️,5
love it,5
This game is great so far. content in this almost like full universe with there own cool comic strip awesome community game is great with stylus my phone comes with one thats how i came to find out and it works great so if so get a stylus ten times better almost like a nintendo ds on roids,5
It's got hot dragons and beautiful writing. What else could anyone possibly want?,5
f2p friebdly and generous events,5
"Wonderful game with amazing mechanics. It is a gacha game, but still amazing for free players.",5
"great game , easy to f2p if you wanted to",5
finally listen to my friends so far the game and story are going well no complaint.,5
poop,5
Great game. responsive customers service. No pay to win and very f2p friendly!,5
Good fun. The mechanics are well designed. UI needs work. Story and writing are some if the best in the industry. Great job. Upgraded to 5 stars cuz the game has kept me playing for a year now. Also the company is very generous with giving out freebees. Thanks.,5
Made my pee pee hard,5
"Pretty awesome game. I love that there's so much to do in it and the story is interesting. There are a few things that would be great if they were fixed, but I'm still rating it 5 stars because they have fixed things in FEH and constantly update so I know they will eventually fix it. I do personally like FEH more since it is more strategic. 04/25/2019 LOVING THE FIRE EMBLEM LOST HEROES EVENT.",5
The game was fun while I could play it. Unfortunately all the downloads in game built up and my phone no longer had the space. Thanks to the newest update the game is unplayable since there is no longer any space on my phone. With a heavy heart I delete this app. ):,2
"it's a good fun game. I enjoy it. However, been having download issues since the last update. Keeps giving network error messages...",3
"I got into it because of the Fire Emblem Heroes event. It was going good, particpitating in the event i wanted to play, playing the story which actually intrigued me, and reading up in all the original characters this game had to offer. Though after doing all these, my interest in the game started to dwindle, still not a bad game at all!",4
"From the characters to the story, everything about this game is well put together. Looks fantastic, sounds great, and plays well.",5
awesome love my rpg,5
Another good app to kill time when at break.,5
Raw,5
"The game mechanics are easy to follow, all the characters are fun and unique, no two characters are the same and their own personal side read along stories and charm will make you fall in love with them, tons of collectibles, the company is so wonderful and giving its just madness haha, When i was recommended this game by my cousin I was very skeptical but ever since I picked this game up Ive been playing everyday , please give this game a chance you may even like it as much as me or even more !",5
best f2p play game out there,5
very giving,5
all I can say is I have nothing but positive things to say about this game this is one amazing exceptional you never get tired of playing there's always a new update that helps to make the game better there's always new content that makes the game better and all I can say is that and never surprises me when they come out with new content that's fun and exciting new dragons new Fighters new girls everything is so amazing.,5
so cool i think im in love💌💘💞💖💕💓💗❤💚💜💙💛,5
best mobile game ive ever played totally hooked,5
"Cute design, decent story, but most importantly THEY FIXED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT! The AI has been improved (co-op is still superior, but that is as it should be), they made it easier to obtain heroes, they put a built in guide for making weapons, and they increased material grinding quest rewards. Yes, it's still grindy, but sometimes that's what I want.",5
"it's a great game overall, it'd be nice if you had a percent bar for the rupie mine. for when they are close to their max output capacity",5
"devs actually listen to feedback, massive improvements in the game since launch",5
Its nice that you don't have to pay to win,5
The room creation has gotten better if power saver is off. Love everything else about the game.,5
I dont understand the Devs point of having you download a game that is over 1GB BUT! You have to keep the game open and it plays this intro song that loops over and over again. if you make it so i can download the game in the background ill reinstall but for now its getting uninstalled.,1
"latest update broke game on my device. Everything was running great until this update, now my game freezes on a white screen before booting. I really like the game, so I hope it gets fixed.",1
Cute,5
Great Game,5
"I like the graphics and gameplay of this game, and the new content that continues coming out keeps you entertained enough to keep playing.",5
"The best gacha game I've ever played, the developers are incredible! New content, bugfixes, QoL improvements, and events come at a breakneck pace while all being very accessible for F2P players. The game focuses on cooperation, and it's a ton of fun diving into epic boss battles with other players.",5
Fun app,4
Great game with interesting characters and story. Devs are great and very generous but low summon rates can be frustrating.,5
One of the games I've constantly enjoyed. Devs are quick to fix bugs and generous with compensation. 💖,5
"Dragalia Lost is a welcome breath of fresh air in the gacha summoning genre of mobile games. With a dev team who generously gives materials and tickets for summoning with every single update, to the ease of access in earning your own materials and tickets without spending a penny. I have never known a more fair gacha game currently out there. It is so free-to-play friendly and the balance between different rarities of adventurers really makes it feel like you're always doing well in missions.",5
"A very fun game. I am suprised about how welcoming the game is the fanbase as they sometimes spoil the player base. While it still has the problems of any gacha type video game, Dragalia is very fair. You don't have to whale, or even pay in order to get good units and dragons. More common 4 stars can do the job of a 4 star character. Overall Dragalia is a very welcoming gacha game and I highly reccomend it. The game play is actually really good and it's so beautiful.",5
"I started playing Dragalia Lost from the very begining when it first started. To be honest, I have never been a big fan of mobile games; however, Dragalia Lost has changed my mind. I find that the developers of the game is very dedicated and hard-working, constant streams of events and new contents are always released and many problems of the games are treated very seriously and professionally. I appreciate their devotion in improving the players' experience.",5
One the most generous and consistently updated games on the store. Cygames continues to deliver the very best in mobile gaming!,5
"One of the few good mobile games out there, which has a development team that actually seems to care about making the game good. The gameplay is fun, there are regular updates, the game is very F2P friendly, and there are constant quality-of-life updates. Even if you never spend money, you'll still be able to complete any quest in the game. If you don't mind a game that can get fairly grindy at times, I'd recommend it.",5
"Extremely f2p game, devs are so generous that every month theres rewards for literally anything like bug fixes etc. Gameplay is co-op without any pvp so it enhances the balance and f2p. Graphics are good and soundtrack is top notch. Totally recommend anyone who likes co op games to try it.",5
it the most fun have all the time.,5
This game is fantastic. It's super fun has a ton of content.,5
Simply Amazing! Great jobs to the devs for making such an easily accessible game for many ages and still have it be fun for my 38 year old self.,5
Very engaging and likeable characters with an interesting story and fun gameplay. Really catchy music.,5
"This is an awesome game with amazing gameplay, but is very large....",5
this game is good play it now,4
Awesome game ...........5 outta 5,5
Frezzes in summoning tutorial want to play but cant fix and ill give 5 stars,1
loving it,5
Cygames added Albert...5*,5
"Very addicted jrpg, graphic is so good and nice to play on free time.",5
it good.,5
this game used to be garbage,5
"This is an amazing game with a great developer team and community. The gameplay is fun, the character stories are enjoyable, and the content is always getting better. I love the dedication that the developers have put into listening to the community and feedback and how hard they strive to make this a great game.",5
It's honestly a great game and the devs are super generous with the free giveaways.,5
"I'm a day one player, almost a year played, and this is hands down the best RPG / Gacha mobile game I have ever been able to play. Cygames has been beyond generous to its player base, fixes most issues promptly, and has done an excellent job with amazing content put out for the game.",5
"A nice and fair F2P gacha, devs put good amount of work for content and listens to the feedback almost immediately. Would recommend for anyone that enjoys action based games. Thanks to the new update now it runs good for lower end devices. Thank you so much for the optimization!",5
The most generous gacha game ever!,5
great free rpg that doesnt nickle and dime you,5
"Much more fun than I expected. Also, the music is amazing. Daoko rocks!",5
"4/5 stars because of all the extra data downloads that can't be done in the background and the fact my phone has frozen and crashed on loading screens twice. Otherwise great game, super fun!",4
Game is good,5
"Great game, really fun",5
I love this game. Best Gacha I've ever played.,5
awesome game. developers really csre about their users.,5
good.,5
fun game,4
cool,5
Fun game although the cutscenes are slow.,4
a nice rpg with no adds the search is finished,5
One of the more enjoyable gachas,5
A fun game and the devs are friendly to f2p,5
best game I have played in a very long time.,5
Nice,5
"The best gacha I've played in the last few years. It's very F2P friendly, has a great community, and always has events up. You may feel pressured to only use 5-stars, but 3 and 4-stars can be as good, or even better. The chibi style graphics aren't for everyone but they are very sharp, detailed, and most importantly, cute as hell. The controls are responsive and have a surprisingly high skill ceiling. The overarching story is fun, but the characters' personalities and interactions are great.",5
awesome game.but just wish no need to download the game when need to progress further,5
"This is the most ""video game"" mobile game I've played. in-game purchases are actually optional, the only reason I would thing to purchase them is if you wanted to do 100 draws in a row or you ran out of upgrade materials. The gameplay is like an old diablo clone: drag to move, tap away to attack, tap and hold to for a different attack, and swipe for a dodge. The music gets in your head, I keep humming the main menu theme while getting coffee. The story can be some heavy anime trash at times.",4
very f2p friendly. I've spent almost 0 dollars aside from.a starter pack and have full 5 star teams.,5
"Always loved Criware. An Auto-move-to-nearest enemy/item function should be in place to reduce frustrations. Maybe a future ""Popular Teammates, Dragons, and items"" feature for those new to the game to have basic guidelines. Events to get Holy water and money would be nice, if they don't already exist. Just a few things here and there, but this game is absolutely SOLID otherwise.",5
Really love gameplay and events,5
"Really fun! The game is gorgeous, the characters are great, and the plot is tropey but decently entertaining. The co-op mechanic makes the game really fun to play with friends and it's casual enough to fit my busy schedule. Overall, I recommend playing this game but keep in mind 5* gacha characters are not needed at all. Some 4* are on par with 5* characters. Edit: they have changed the gacha and now pulling 5* adventurers or dragons is much better! Highly recommend.",5
"fun, good music, cute characters. Controls are lame but auto mode is a God send",5
the story is great,5
this good gaem : ))))),5
"fun game, at first i thought its gonna be a boring game but once u get use to it (control) its actualoy a sick game",5
I am absolutely in love with this game ❤️,5
cool game,5
Bought a new phone just for this. Not regretting it.,5
Fantastic,5
it fun,5
Good game with good multiplayer. Is fun.,5
"Not pay to win crazy game... and we all know what am talking about. I do wish they had guild, so long as they stayed PvE, and not competing against other players. I will 5 star this game if they add a guild function.",4
💩,1
cute!,4
great game if you dont mind the repitition! lots of events plenty of things to do!,5
This is the best game for your phone,5
good,5
This would be a much more fun experience if the game didn't crash every few minutes.,3
game has gotten a lot better. super enjoyable and i actually dont dread rolling. there does seem to he issues with the oneplus 7 pro though,3
very fun,5
"Beautiful visuals, engaging story, and fun gameplay. what more could you want?",5
"Great game with good controls, asthetics and music. the biggest problem with this game is the low drop rate for usable characters. you feel often bogged down if you don't have a specific character to compete with during events and most group will exclude you for not having a specific character.",4
Fun but VERY grind heavy,3
Cute graphics and classic lunia-like game play. Brings all the memories back,5
Perfect game,5
"So firstly the OST Top freaking notch! Second, the summom RNG seems much more forgiving than most Gacha Games so i have to give even more kudos there! Thirdly the story seems to start picking up fairly quickly! I could go on about the perks of this game in comparison to competitors but 500 character limit, so instead I will mention my only gripe. Which is that I can't move and attack at the same time. While that does mean you have to choose attack or mobility, it's quality of life is all!",4
Keep crash,1
beautiful and fun game,5
It's video games,5
"The game story, gameplay and characters are more investing, fun, and interesting. It obviously isnt for everyone BUT it is worth trying. it is very gacha friendly and you can beat all the content if you didn't roll at all. It's the first game I've continuously played amd eill play for thr coming future.",5
love it but keeps crashing...,4
"This game Is amazing, if you have time and don't have nothing else to do, I recommend installing this game.",5
"The story wasn't very interesting to me. The fact that you have to download the mission before you played it made me really dislike it because I just wasted time, they should've just implicated a download all to make it run better and faster.",3
"Alright, hate Stamina Systems, but i game is fun.",4
"Dragalia Lost is fun and easy to play plus gives the player plenty of drops that enable you to summon new units frequently. The UI is stylish and matches the feeling of the game spot on, characters you've obtained interact in the background in multiple scenes and nod their heads in beat with the catchy music as you jump from menu to menu. A slight downside is that the story seems to be a standard adventure tale , nothing that really stands out right now.",5
great game,5
"This game is damn cool, fun, exciting and awesome indeed. :)",5
good f2p friendly game love it,5
大愛DAOKO!,5
just really fun and well designed. just need to download data before playing!,5
"Definitely a good game for mobile devices. My device is fairly old and lags quite a bit while I try to play, but I would say that the story is interesting and that the level up system for units and items is quite nice. The music is top notch as well. Despite its generosity for premium currency, it is still a hassle to get many of the obtainable F2P currency to improve your units. With that said, the game is fun, but unless you have the time of money to grind you're gonna have a rough time.",4
best mobile in the world. too many reasons to list. main one being its commitment to the players and constant improvements. proof that good companies still exist,5
They actually listen to their feedback.,5
Fantastic Game! but the file size sure is huge...,5
def worth the time of day.,5
cool game,4
"great game, but there should be an option whether we want to listen to the new music or the old music.",4
best game ever,5
great game,5
Excellent game,5
Cool! Story based RPG! Still a newbie but damn I'm so into it! Though downloading for every story is just 😂,5
This is very good. bit complicated at first and found it confusing to use interface but I am thoroughly enjoying it now I've gotten through the basics. 5/5 cant wait to see more.,5
amazing game !,5
great game,5
"It's good so far probably gonna hit a pay wall eventually, who knows👍👍",5
BEST GAME 10/10,5
fun,5
"Love the story so far, hopefully it only gets better from here! The graphics are cool and fresh, the gameplay is simple and the controls are easy to use, (although I find myself swatting mushrooms more often than I should since I get a little turned around sometimes)! Hopefully I can summon some super ultra rare heroes!",5
top notch presentation and feels real good to play so far :),5
cool,5
"Easy to understand, with cute character designs.",5
"good game once you get past all the tutorials and understand all the game better, but above everything else, very good.",5
Its amazing as soon i saw the direct for this game I WAS SOLD THE CONCEPT OF CHARACTERS TURNING INTO DRAGONS SUCH GOOD CHARACTERS A REALLY GOOD STORY 10/10 #eudenforsmash,5
mobile games are getting real good.,5
"fun game. cute art. great music. At higher levels it takes way too long to fill energy. I understand that this is a ""pay to speed up"" trap but for those that dont want to pay at around level 60 onwards its basicly an afk game.",2
"Nice Game.. keep it up, eventhough i got problems to start using wifi connection.. otherwise the app is good on my Samsung S9 😊",5
"1⃣🌟 βecause I want the Developer to FIX this Issue with the NOTIFICATION bar NOT hiding itself post opening this Application. Fix & I give🖐🌠 IMMEDIATELY, I Promise... Until then, forgive me Nintendo, your Developers need more resources I guess....🙏💔🤦🏼‍♂️",1
Crash on Pixel device,1
control at first is wonky but you get used to it. super cute game,5
good,4
fun,5
"Game is cool, combat is refreshing and interactive.",5
game can load slow when not on wifi....this is the only complaint i have. otherwise it is great.,4
"Pull rates are really bad, gameplay is boring. Music and art are top shelf!",3
Dragalia Lost is addicting and definitely a lot of fun to play! the story is compelling and the fighting system is interesting! Absolutely love the crossover with Dragalia Lost and Fire Emblem!,5
it gooood,5
wish i could play but it doesn't start.,1
Nice,4
Its good but it keeps not responding,3
"Very free to play friendly, no need to promote heroes for end game and story heroes aren't trash they won't slow you down.",5
"models, models, models...",4
"The game is polished and has great presentation. As of the FEH collab update, the developers have been phenomenal at implementing updates and QoL that makes the game more fun. Best of all they are very accepting of feedback such as allowing wyrmprints trading and their removal in summons.",5
best mobile game on the market! definitely a game and company worth supporting.,5
Awesome. lots of fun. f2p friendly,5
The game play is challenging and a lot of fun. They add new characters all the time. There's enough to do to get the currency to keep pulling 10. The devs listen to the community. This is not a pay to win game. This is one of the best games available on mobile.,5
Everything is way better now. Or it has been for a while but im just now coming back wooo,3
ITS A GOOD GAME YO,5
big gay,5
I love the game so much however i hate how u have to download every episode that what I dont like.,2
Not able to connect to the game at all,1
its super cool,5
improvements to the game systems have made it far more enjoyable.,4
"These guys did it. A perfect balance (imo) between f2p and ptw. The characters that are 4-5 stars are the ones to aim for. Getting 5 Star characters outta the random draw system isn't as bad as you would normally assume. Getting premium currency is easy with coop play and completing events. Customization with cards (wyrmprints) that give characters extra perks (Dmg, resists, etc) and then transforming into different Dragons, pandas, even Unicorns. Me and my wife love this game. Great work guys!",5
i cant even insall it,1
"in ny shortntime playing this game it hasnt even once tried to ahove microtransactions on me and that is appreciated. Fun game, great production value in every menu ,unit you summon, and even in the music.Fantastic game so far.",5
good game,4
Very Great Game,5
Pretty fun so far. Got a lot of free summons and got lucky pulls.,5
amazing game and graphics! super fun!,5
Is game,4
"This game nearly killed my phone because of its large size,gameplay and graphics. Do not download this unless you want to spend $80 to repair your phone.",1
derptastic,5
Really good and epic my name chegg,5
"pretty fun, generous devs too",4
"The game combat feels amazing with captivating visuals. The dev sure put effort in making every heroes feel alive with backstories well-written. The emote chat is good, preventing ingame toxicity. But I'd love to see some kind text-based chat to be implemented lobby-wise or some kinda guild system so players can discuss strategy in details",4
"Absolutely stunning, the type of story telling I thought we'd never see in mobile games. I'll add that the RPG aspect is awesome, and the events give you the feeling you are playing a forever real time master piece.",4
"First of all. Awesome game indeed. The gameplay and graphic is absolute perfect. If you love chibi character, than that even more of a reason you should try out this game. Very generous Dev team and amazing community around the world. Since the day I discovered this game. I din't even open the Appstore to try out others. 11/10 is my rating.",5
So I absolutely LOVE this game and would love to keep playing it too. the only gripe I have is that my phone doesn't have enough space. 4 gigs is a lot of space for an app and I wish I could keep playing but I can't. highly recommend to any that can!!!,4
easy to get in to. simple gameplay with upgrade mechanics to get stronger.,4
awesome video game!!!,5
From my experience all I can say is that this is an extremely addictive game and I cant recommend it enough.,4
tuff i would like hammers or gontelets tho bet tuff💪😎👏👏,4
fun game controls taller some greeting used to but you get them fairly quickly,5
"Excellent free to play RPG with fun and interesting characters, and the idling element isn't the entire experience the game has to offer. Lots of long term growth, and suitable for anyone looking for a neat RPG they can come back to play daily without feeling starved for resources or pidgeonholed into buying game currency.",5
very fun fast game play gorgeous colourful graphics lots of fun well recommend to all,5
so smooth,5
graphics are amazing,5
"Anyone complaining about not getting 5 star heroes does not actually play the game. With the balance changes, 5 star heroes are just unique to banners, but all characters are viable. Possibly one of the most f2p friendly mobile games.",5
"Very interesting game, very addictive, very nice graphic",5
its fun,5
"A very enjoyable game!! good graphics and a good plot. also always has a fair enough chanve for summoning a 5 star, at least for me. Overall, I LOVE this game!! I cant stop playing it.",5
"update to come, for now its great.",5
"I'm always skeptical when downloading another gacha game, but this is pretty cool. The music is awesome, there's actual voice-acted scenes, it runs at a decent pace, they give you a bunch of items for simply starting (at least right now), and the game is pretty fun to play. Nothing inherently bad about it yet in my opinion, looking forward to playing it more.",5
One of my favorite one handed activities.,5
everything about the game is amazing fun to play and easy to learn.,5
"honestly one of the best gachas I've ever seen, great gameplay, and solid story. i also looove dragalia life! its hella funny and cute!!!! props to the dev team for being so nice with the last few events!!!",5
"So far, this game is amazingly fun. No bugs and great performance.",5
very fun to play and is a great time waster but some things like how it doesn't really explain everything that well but that makes you actually have to play the game so i guess its for a good reason lmao but besides that its great and super fun,4
so awesome!,5
"lots of fun, a dynamic game",5
"The game hasn't even been out for a year and yet the development team has crafted one of the best experiences on mobile. They are constantly adding new content, listening to player feedback and doing what they can to make Dragalia Lost the best that it can be. Nintendo is the publisher of this product and you can really feel the trademark ""Nintendo Polish"" that the game has. There's so much passion and love being poured into Dragalia that it is easily Nintendo's best mobile title.",5
"The game has vastly improved over the last 6 months. Everything is streamlined now, and there's more to do than ever! You don't even have to summon at all in order to complete all the quests! Sit back and enjoy some top tier music and fun!",5
"Fun, excellent. However, it takes way too long for the story to update. The filler events are really good—I enjoy them a lot, but I want to see more of the story like in FEH. The story update period of two months is just ridiculous if you ask me.",5
"Phenomenal game. You can easily find yourself sinking hours on end into it. It has a ton of different ways to play, contains online multiplayer that runs very smoothly, and hosts different events quite frequently. It does take up a lot of storage, but if your phone can handle it, then I HIGHLY recommend you give it a shot.",5
One of the best mobile game i ever played. Very f2p friendly too,5
fire emblem characters are fun!,5
I love this game! Developers listen and they are super generous with gifts! Also rates are decent.,5
"It's an amazing game but with a few updates it could be even better,for example the amount  required to summon for dragons and characters and reducing some materials require to upgrade buildings.",5
one of the best mobile games ive ever played. totaly f2p. if you like rpg gacha games this is for you,5
Best game ever! No other gacha game could ever compete.,5
I could be better,5
"It's refreshingly light and easy to control, great voice acting & nice music, could do with more easier ways to get summons thro.",4
nice :),5
most enjoyable mobile game I've played thus far.,5
its fun,5
not bad but you should be able to get silver coins like you do with animal crossing or mario run to add to your nintendo account for doing missions,2
Instant classic,5
"For some reason, even though i have the music vocals turned off, there are still vocals playing. Also, the settings do not save. Other than that, this game is excellent! I'll change it to 5 stars when you fix those bugs.",5
great game,5
"I love this game, maybe a little to much",5
fun,5
"super impressed with everything so far. it's too early to prompt for a review, I just turned level 2. I cant give perfect 5 without seeing more of the game. but so far this game is much better than recent failures in the mobile market like ES blades.",4
its very fun game..,5
Fun game cool voice acting amazing music. What more can you ask for!,5
nice,4
Fun game,5
"Amazing game; exciting gameplay, and intriguing story. Carries the quality you'd expect from Nintendo.",5
"DL is hella fun where you craft items & weapons, & have to use some strategy to win instead of mindlessly bashing a target to win. The controls need some tuning, but it doesn't take away from the game. Graphics are great, music is great, art style is great. In short I'm really loving this game.",5
nice graphic,5
"Dragalia Lost is the mobile game of the century. You'll be hardpressed to find a more lively and colorful rpg that really feels like a game, not an interactive cutscene.",5
i don't even know what to say to you 😭😭😭😭. too much data required. y'all need to make a xbox game 😂👀👀👀👀😂😂😂😂😂 LMFAO,1
Good game so far,5
"Great, well polished",5
poifect,5
ok,5
When i was first notified of this game (when lily came out) it was really fun i got her on my first summon and i liked her i didnt play the game that much at the time so i eventually drifted away from it and stopped playing competely. I have now come back into the game ( during that bunny girl event) and ive really grown alot since due to help from my friends and advice from other people really happy about the fire emblem lost heroes event which is how i grew alot thanks nintendo amazing game😃,5
thanks you for dragalia lost app,5
fun little game,5
awesome,5
"Good graphics, bad gameplay, extremely poor gacha rates. You won't get far without gambling a ton of money and there are dozens of games already out that do it better. Steer clear, play something else. Try Star Ocean Anamnesis.",1
😀,5
"Very good so far, however there is a bit of lag, but it's manageable.",4
This game is awesome and the comics are cool,5
fun free timewaster with cute waifus,5
it good,5
I love the story and I simply love dragons,5
"So far so good. Controls are sometimes a bit awkward but I have had so much fun. No pressure to pay cash too, bonus!!",5
good,3
"not nearly enough fun or meaning to support the repetitiveness, so much faster to feel burnout compare to ffbe, 5 months vs 2 yyears. Units are too similar, main character has boring personality, so the story is boring because it is created around him.",2
"Adore this game! I started playing this game with the Canadian release. The dev team behind this game is absolutely wonderful. They always seem to take player feedback and improve the game. Even if it isn't perfect, they are always updating. The gameplay is fun and there's almost always an event going on with things to do. It is a gacha style game so something RNGesus can be a bit of jerk. Thankfully the game is very generous with its summoning currency.",5
i love the story its amazing and these graphics though on point and i just live dragond period,5
i simply love the story and the graphics oh so good and i love dragond period,5
Thos is a womderful little game! Love it!,5
loved the game but kept crashing,2
"im qyite impressed, not pay to win at all, a great mobile jrpg experience, pretty much every character is viable in the right hands",5
love it so much it is f2p game the gacha system it easy to get 5*character,5
Great game but prone to occasional crashes (at least one a day),3
"Game looks like it is high quality... However, the first few minutes after the introduction you realize that it is nothing but a ""gatchapon"" (lottery) game. Meaning that you will FOREVER be spending in game resources (and what they really want:) money to buy more -chances- for rare/strong monsters/weapons/skills/etc.   Nintendo might make a lot of money off of a few super rich whales that don't mind wasting money like this... but I'm out. Hopefully a full-price game comes out (even if mobile) from this franchise. The story, etc... looks good, but just not worth wasting that much time and/or money to play.",2
Awesome,5
good,5
I can see myself playing this religiously. Voice work is not that good though.,4
"developers listen to the players, many quality of life changes. game play is fun and offers a good cooperative experience",5
"This game is a labor of love. The devs have fixed all issues players have had with it. The gacha was kind of brutual, but they removed useless items and made it cheaper. They've added QoL updates, they're doing collabs now, and it just keeps getting better.",5
awesome,4
Catchiest menu song. Game is definitely worth trying,4
Fun game!,5
most generous and playable gacha game I've ever played. Tons of fun. Devs listen to the community and continually improve the gsme too.,5
fun and simple game,5
"Excellent game. Stamina isn't something I tend to limit myself with, but to each their own. Well made game, as usual from Nintendo!",5
"I'm in love with this game's machanics! Its easy to play, and very beginner friendly too!",5
"Great game that desperately needs some file management options. There's no way to avoid downloading cutscenes/story bits, and you can't delete them after you download them. This sucks, especially since the game is already around 2gb big, when counting the 1gb of stuff you have to download after the tutorial. An option to clear the cache w/o getting rid of essential files, or an option to skip these story downloads would rock! I currently cant progress the game due to insufficient space. Pls fix?",2
nah,3
"Fun gameplay, great graphics and an infectiously cute art style.",5
"The game has made drastic improvements to the pulls of the game which is nice. My only remaining issue is that, especially with this new Fire Emblem event, the game has been consistently crashing on me whenever I enter or exit a battle. I adjusted the settings on my game so that I could test if my phone was simply being overworked or couldnt handle the game, and no matter what I do, it keeps crashing.",4
"Ever since the double wyrmprint update, this app had gone from being awesome and stable to buggy. Even if a game is awesome, you can't play now than 5 minutes without a crash. it gets old after awhile. There may be a memory leak.",3
I think it's a great game. I'm hoping that it will get ported over onto the switch.,4
"Great game. Usually don't like mobile games, but this is one of the few that is enjoyable",5
"Amazing game, It combines facility, RPG, and gacha all in one. No P2W and the devs are very generous in events. Amazing graphics with smooth, fast-paced gameplay and the voice lines are quite unique. The moment I installed this game I knew it was perfect for me. Definitely would recommend to anyone~",5
fun so far,4
"pretty great game. Let's you unlock stuff without actual money all the time.. unlike all the Chinese knockoff apps, like 90% of the game library.",5
user: stop compensating him. Hes dead. Hes dead. draglost: *showers wyrmite and water on users*,5
very fun!,5
"I'm loving this game so far, good music, characters are ADORABLE, AMAZING crossover with Fire Emblem, I actually got 3 5 Stars in one Tenfold summon, I got a dragon and 2 Veronicas xD, but I gotta say my second Veronica turned into some sort of EXP currency so..That's something :(.",5
"So I decided to come back to play again after stopping around late December and all my backup data was gone even when I sync my Nintendo account, it was just gone, so thank u for not just losing all my data but for making me never play this game ever again.",1
"EASILY, the best gacha game ever made. Beautiful visuals, catchy tracks, and likeable characters, but above all, this is the first gacha since Fire Emblem Heroes with a dynamic and engaging gameplay. Not to mention the best part about the game, the generous developers. This is a game for F2P players cus you get showered in gifts and rewards, not to mention a free unit on certain events. Just download the game, you'll be inpressed with how fun this game is.",5
it's actually rly fun but the need to download slot is kinda annoying (just slightly) but besides that it's super definitely recommended playing,4
just started the game last week and already got a 4 fire emblem characters. the rates in the game are so good. flawless,5
"I was surprised to see how stingy this one is even after being called out directly by Nintendo for it. Daily summon potential for f2p players is very unsatisfying. Most of the dragons and adventurers are terrible, and have even worse 'personal stories'. Daily rewards feel anything but. Pulling a duplicate 5 star is painfully demoralizing - you get a pittance of eldwater and it still brings your pull chance down. Cash shop is macro-transaction, not micro as it should be.",1
"First, this is a gacha game, so stay away if you have gambling tendencies or don't like grinding as gameplay. But if you're looking for a gacha, you can do little better than Dragalia Lost. This is perfect for stuff like commutes, and the occasional couple hours (~twice per week) of concentrated gameplay. So far, Cygames has been an extremely responsive developer, and their effort in developing this game far surpasses most other gacha developers. Whatever launch-time flaws in the game have been patched, or are being patched. As with other Japan-oriented gacha, paying to pull is prohibitively low-value, but the starting chars and f2p or dolphin experience is quite decent. Music is top-notch and many have very LIT Japanese rap in them. 2D Art style is crisp and a little boring, but extremely versatile. By now there's quite a bit of content notwithstanding regular events and updates, though certainly nowhere near mature >3-4 year old gacha.",5
Game is way to big takes ages to download needs to be optimized seemed like an alright game otherwise.,2
lovely,5
"This is a game about story not necessarily challenging gameplay. All but the highest gameplay levels arent that challenging, but the highest ones are really rewarding in terms of gameplay. The game is a grinder, but most mobile games are. This game does have gatcha elements but I have almost 4/5 elements with full power characters and i haven't spent a dime yet. I plan to because I want to, not because I have to. I love the effort and generosity of the developers, worth checking out ay least.",5
great game,5
"This is a fantastic mobile RPG gacha by Nintendo! The gatcha is pretty good, there are a lot's of characters and dragons to collect. Gameplay is great, the story is pretty good and there are plenty of other bosses (dragon trials, void battles and imperial onslaught) that you can play/farm to get stronger. In fact, there are so many ways for you  to improve your strength which is measured in 'might', that it is often overwhelming! You can upgrade adventurers with gold crystals, wyrmprints with consecrated water, dragons with succulent dragonfruits, weapons with whetstones and mana circles to upgrade your adventurers in various ways with mana and other materials. There are 5 elements: fire (red), wind (green), water (blue), shadow (dark purple) and light (light yellow), and elemental enemies, materials, weapons etc to go with them. There is also the Halidom, a building feature where you build buildings to boost yourself and farm materials. Maybe the beats part of this game is the regular updates and events from the Dragalia Lost team that add new characters, stories, buildings and improvements that mean that the game is always improving!",5
"Fun game. Story and set up is interesting, a bit laggy but that's because of my home and the internet is far from my room. but besides all that, it's a game worth playing.",5
The game has potential but the gacha a system was just the bad apple of the Bunch the rates are really low than what is shown in the game,1
so far so good!!,5
"As expected from Nintendo, this is a very polished, fun game. At first the gameplay was not my thing, but it grew on me. Definitely recommend trying it out!",5
hell yess the grafic's are amazing if I had the ability to put myself in a game I would,5
best gacha ever,5
very fun and good for passing the time,5
for those mobile gamers that really like a game with a grind or a game to spend time on dragalia is a really fun one,5
Fun gacha,4
loving the storyline so far and the game controls are pretty tight. awesome game,5
sooo amazing fire a mobile game,5
"I love the game but I found a game breaking glitch for me, when I summond it freezes and it stays stuck on the part when you see what you got and it also freezes my phones Ui system if you can fix that I can change this into a 5 review",3
Cute!,5
it really fun and addicting,5
well done,4
Amazing game.,5
fun,5
why do games ask if u like them so soon i dont know if i like it yet ive barely played an hour,4
"Awesome game,great graphics and a very great way to spend your time... but the movement part of the game could use some improvements",5
This is easily the best gacha game that I've ever played. The developers constantly provide updates and summoning currency. This game is not P2W at all and even if you pay you still grind for materials which it does put you at an advantage you won't be completely farther ahead than a free player. Five Star characters are also not needed at all in this game. People consistently clear the hardest content with 4 stars and sometimes even 3 stars like Melody. I highly recommend this fantastic game,5
Dragalia lost is one of the most generous free to play gacha games on the market.,5
"Very generous gacha game, great music and engaging gameplay. Definitely one of the best gacha games out there. If you are looking for a new gacha this is the one for you.",5
i can't use my 5 ⭐voucher from the fire emblem event!?!?!?!? what can i do to fix this?,5
awesome,5
"really loved the game but when I got a new phone and I tried to get back in through the back up save, it just said nope and I deleted the app after that cause I didnt want to restart.",3
You can tell they put effort into this game!,5
AMAZING!!!!,5
"They are definitely pushing for a review a little early on, but so far I'm really enjoying the game. I'm very impressed considering it's a mobile game, it almost plays like something on console.",5
love it,5
One of the best mobile RPGs out there.,5
f2p friendly,5
so much fun,5
Hands down the best hero collector game.,5
Nice,5
it great but the controls to move are bit hard to control other then that the game is awesome,5
It's fun.,5
good game!!!,5
"Deep, enjoyable game from Nintendo. I like the characters and the daily modes and events. Problem is I haven't come close to finishing the story because pressing through the story sequences takes forever. Prefer shorter story sequences like in FEH. This is my second most played mobile game behind that though.",4
Good,4
pretty good,5
I love playing this game Cygame do good job at listing to the player base,5
"a little laggy but overall a good game, would recommend.",4
Fun,5
"Dragalia is like ni no kuni's world, combat, and colorful style meets fire emblem heroes' game design, but so much more. I don't think I'll be playing any other mobile game for the foreseeable future. Edit: After having enough time to complete the campaign and listen to a host of heroes' stories, I wanted to add that the this game's writing is second to none.",5
good game,5
it crashes NONSTOP. it crashes after just ONE mission in results screen. UNPLAYABLE,1
"Generous gacha, great graphics, and best of all the English voice acting isn't cringe! Controls take some getting used to but I think with experience players will find them easy to negotiate.",5
"The staff is so amazing! They want to make the game as fun and fair as possible for everyone playing. That includes the free-to-players! On top of that, most of the characters have a really thought-out background story that really makes me want to get to know every single one! Thank you so much Dragalia Lost team! I'm really enjoying your game! =D",5
"It has japanese audio, this is more than I hoped for 😁",5
It takes too long to download now and I hope they make a lite version soon because it takes quite a bit of space,3
gucci gang,5
great game! graphics are nice!,5
"I want to thank Cygames for making such an amazing game. You treat us all fairly and haven't let us down once. I've gradually started migrating from FEH to Dragalia and honestly, I don't regret it. Keep up the amazing work!!",5
"Dragalia is a very good RPG. The story pulls you in, the characters are very lovable and fully voiced in Japanese! I feel the gacha system is pretty fair, since I've had a lot of luck getting 5* units. The collaboration and events reveal really nice characters, and they overload you with Wyrmite to summon from the gacha! It's very easy to strengthen your team too, because upgrade materials are readily available. As a side note, the community is great as well! Eveyone on co-op is so helpful! :')",5
great quality game. just wish they had some level of pvp or something competitive along with the story mode,5
"truthfully its a lot of fun, it feels like a lot of mobile dungeon crawlers ive played before but one with a lot more love and energy put into it. breaking away from the basic flrmula for these types of games it's quite fresh and unique as well as extremely cute. art direction is on point too.",5
Fun time. Interesting mechanics.,5
"Game has been much better since they removed the wyrmprints from the gacha without reducing the summon rates for heroes and dragons. The devs are extremely generous with free resources, probably the most f2p gacha game in the market.",5
Nice art direction and awesome gameplay experience!,5
Pretty enjoyable. Nice game with a cute artstyle. My only issue is sometimes the aoes are instant so you don't get time to dodge. Overall a fun game. Would recommend.,5
"great rpg, good storyline with easy control",5
pretty good,5
doesnt let you play if bootloader unlocked. phone isn't rooted!,1
"I don't usually play apps for long, but I've stuck with this one since it launched. I still really enjoy it and even spent some money on it. It's fun for both the hardcore and casual crowds.",5
it crashes after a few minutes on my ipad all the time. it happens too often it's annoying the hell out of me. please fix this asap thanks,1
i hope theres an optional d pad coming soon..,5
I really love the game but had to uninstall due to home much memory it took up. I will redownload once my device can handle all the data,4
This game is awesome but I lost all my data do ya,5
"app keeps crashing midgame but otherwise its good, pls look into it",4
"(first time review for this game) The music is fitting. The character personas are surprisingly unique. The gameplay is alright for what it is. On an LG it lags a bit on the lowest settings but is managable. The part that urks me is the energy system, which hasnt been an issue yet, and the download of every quest. Could do better with more weapons though. I'm still missing a bow... but im sure to get one eventually in chapter 2. If you dont auto, you can 1 man every level. 4.3/5 in my books.",4
Great game overall but it takes up too much space. I absolutely love the game but I might have to move it to another device because of space issues.,4
"So much fun, I'm so glad I found this game and it's now in Canada",5
has fliud gameplay and a good story and decent graphics,4
great game,5
perfect game!,5
so far so good,4
fun,5
it's pretty neat,5
Fun game. The controls aren't that great though.,4
greaat,5
Being the main character in a anime is pretty cool.,5
good game could use a little bit more work on controls but overall great game,5
Changed the gacha pool to not have wrym prints but the rates stay the same overall. It has done good and brought me back.,5
"Absolutely fantastic game. Great story, easy to learn, tough to master, rewarding co-op play. I've never spent a cent on the game and don't feel like it holds me back from any content. The constant updates, gifts from devs, and devoted fanbase make playing a joy, not a chore.",5
"Decent fun bash, needs more fire emblem characters",4
this game is fun cute and has a lot of cool characters,5
I like it ALOT,5
"Sooooooo good! BEST mobile game ever! Veey very very f2p friendly, so much so that im going non f2p JUST TO SUPPORT. Also LOVE the coop modes and pve, hopefully ni pvp cause too many games ive played had issues with pvp. Think coop is more than enough for fun and allowing for a great community! Hope devs see this & truly do not change anything too much, as the way things are, allow still for ppl to go non f2p at their discretion like myself. THANKS AGAIN!",5
Awesome sauce,5
absolutely stunning,5
love this game very addictive,5
its great so far!,5
"Best game ever. Have been playing it almost since launched, and it is incredible how the developers make such huge improvement over the past six months by listening to the feedback of the player community. It feels like a totally different game at this point, and I haven't been so hyped for an update of a game for such a long time. 100% recommendation for anyone who is into this type of game!",5
"The gameplay is good, music loops quickly in the menus, gets old real quick when you are doing stuff. It looks great for mobile game, the 3D models look great as well as the 2d artwork.",4
The best developers of any mobile I've ever played. they are extremely generous with all of the free summons and items they give. They actually listen to player feedback and update the game often with fixes and quality of life changes. They just recently removed wyrmprints from the summons which was the one thing that players had any problem with since they were just filling summons with fluff and make your pity 5 star disappointing. They did not need to do this and just did it for the players,5
best developer ever. listen ronfeedback and always making things better for the players. kudos to cygames,5
"I have a lot of fun, though sometimes it just kinda stops working when I'm doing things in the menus. Will give 5* when that's no longer an issue for the Motorola Z2 Play",4
"A cute and fun game. Gameplay: Real time action combat with co-op. The controls are responsive and customizable if you want to tweak things like sensitivity. Graphics: Cute, anime insipired, and chibi, with many unique models. The character and wyrmprint arts are gorgeous. Sound: Probably the best part of the game. New soundtracks for nearly every event, featuring JPop artist DAOKO. Other: Extremely generous and responsive dev team, lots of QoL changes for the better. App could be smaller tho.",4
ITS SO LAGGY -.-,1
"Dragalia is head and shoulders above any other mobile title I've played. The world and cast are fantastic and colorful, the combat is fluid and fun, and theres so much to do. With dragalia you feel like you're playing a true game, unlike alot of other mobile titles.",5
fun and cute game. forgiving gacha,5
great game! I love it,1
"Great game. On the surface it looks like all the other F2P but its much better. It has quality and depth, and plays smoothly.",5
Nintendo always delivers.,5
pretty fun game but controller takes time to get used to,4
Honesty this is one of the best gacha games there is,5
This the best game ever I have been waiting on this games for about a month keep up the great work😊,5
"awesome game was what i was looking for xD, loved the dragon ^^",5
A lot more polished than expected!,5
great game. def a top tier gotcha,5
"fun game, nice to play on my breaks in work! only gripe is that you have to download each segment of the game separately. The game looks great, but personally, I'd like a d-pad or something, some of the attacks for range units can be a bit tricky to aim, but I can live with it. Very Nintendo JRPG and I'll probably be giving hours and hours of my life to it!",5
it cool,5
Stimulating combat nice progression.,5
amazing game,5
amazing,5
"As a product fashioned from Nintendo, the great quality of this game is no surprise. There are moments where it lags a bit, but the controls are very responsive and the story is very engaging. I just hope that these constant downloads don't force me to delete other apps....or hinder me from proceeding in the game period, which is my biggest concern, and the reason I can't give this game all 5 stars.",4
Wasn't super sure what to expect but it's a rather charming and simple hack and slash that's fun to play for little bits at a time to help pass time,5
"Nintendo have done it, this is something fresh compared to all those pay to win gacha games out there, there is gatcha but the game is absolutely free to play without it, even the currency used to roll is obtainable easily. the gameplay is extremely gripping. Overall a fantastic game",5
this game is great all around except after the new update my game crashes right after i beat a quest but before that my game runs super smooth on max settings. Help?,5
"It's a fine game, but they need to fix the update space so it won't take too much of it.",4
It felt good coming back in the game.,5
the most polished gacha game ever created.,5
Nintendo really did a great job making this game. I didn't expect a mobile game fro. Nintendo to be so good! The story mode is awesome as well as the interaction between characters. The game keepa you wanting more and more.,5
Dragalia Lost is Great!,4
So far the story is fun and engaging. Combat is fluid which is cool. Graphics are nice and there seems like a lot to do. Can't wait to see all the fun heroes I can collect and use!,5
12 star developer,5
only because it' Nintendo,5
"the game is great however... it crashes all the time! i can't even play the game 10minutes without it crashing. please fix! ""lg stylo 4"" will get a higher rating once its fixed.",3
"game looks fun, but an install, then an update, then a hour long download is very offputting. but ill try again, it does look fun!",4
"Boring at 1st but after unlocking more functions, it's as good as the good reviews says. As for the bad ones, I haven't encountered any yet. This game has the best of other games. The game feels like a more sophisticated action rpg in the 90's but it's on mobile and that's a huge step.",5
"A lot of fun. Takes up a considerable amount of phone space and requires you to invest a couple dollars to really get going, but once you do that it's a total blast. Really loving the current Fire Emblem crossover event.",5
"Spend a loooong time downloading, only to spend twice as long loading. spent all morning just watching the loading bar instead of playing. That sucks",1
pretty fun rpg,5
"One thing to fix mostly is the performance issues on older phones, as I did not have this issue while this game was still on early release. Otherwise, the core gameplay loop is addictive, combat itself feels fast and light for small play sessions. Overall a good game, just to fix these performance issues.",4
fun and unique,5
movement is tricky but fun game,5
デザインはいい。UI の動きテンポもいい。 action 部分の操作は最悪。正直、白猫の劣化版。 ゲーム自体… 白猫と一緒。Fantasy Life Online のパクリだったら良かった。 攻撃->回避->攻撃の間繋がりがないので、動作が固い。,2
this game is really fun,5
Fun,5
I was able to play the game for maybe 30 min and enjoy it so far. When I closed the app to do other things and came back to it I cant even get past the title screen because I cant connect to the server? Please fix this issue.,1
"New game from Nintendo. Characters are original from the game and right now there's the fire emblem series. Pretty fun game so far, most I do is tap. I still have to get used to the gameplay and build my team and dragons.",5
"controls arent bad, the gameplay is quick and solid.",4
It was good when I first downloaded the game but now i do not think so. The game randomly crashes after doing one round of the quests. When this gets fixed ill give the game a 5*.,1
"Engaging, fun, simple; easy controls, a well paced story, and LOTS OF WAIFUS/ HUSBANDOS! I recommend this game for people looking for a fun engaging gacha with little needed to pick up and some spare time on your hands. I'll admit I havent played through to the endgame and I don't believe it deserves 5 stars, YET. Congrats to the devs and to Nintendo for having a complete package that doesnt feel like a cashgrab, and is relitively high quality!😉👌",4
"fun at first, but you run into a paywall where it becomes near impossible to progress or upgrade your weapons/characters. The AI for auto battle is horrible, it runs you INTO damage, or just makes your character stand there in a damage field. what's the point of a feature that gets you killed almost every time you use it? Void battles are ridiculously unbalanced and impossible unless you're at least 6000 might above the ""required"" level. you can't even take a quarter of the bosses health.",2
"Fantastic gameplay, great art and story telling.",5
"Nicely entertaining, love the event, and lots of its characters!",5
overall great presentation with the music and nice graphics and art. gameplay is kind of shallow it seems but there isn't to many games with action combat.,4
Dragalia lost is a fun game that reminds me of birds eye view beat em ups but this one has an enormous amount of flare with how many unique and stylish characters they have. so at the end of this I find myself really loving this game. Especially when they got a fire emblem heroes colab right now.,5
fun and easy,4
No Homie Falchion. Fix it!,1
excellent Game,5
very awesome game.,5
good game,5
very fun game!,5
good game,5
"everything i love about granblue mixed with hack n slash rpg, this is it chief",5
The music is awesome and is f2p friendly. Also is you choose to spend you get a guarantee event units. No more paying and praying.,5
"I instantly got what I wanted, which was Veronica, so not much to say but GG!",4
Awesome game! i really hope that it keeps thriving.💖💖,5
always seek improvement 🙈❤️❤️👅,4
I sometimes have issue with getting locked into a force attack when all I want to do is run away but aside from that I've a great time playing. A tad grindy but aren't all these kinds of games?,5
love it,5
It's really fun and rewarding to play but the app crashes a lot whenever I participate in the in game events. It will crash when summoning sometimes as well.,3
Edit 4/28/19: Came back to the game during their FEH crossover and noticed they reduced their 10 pull summonings from 1500 to 1200. Also Getherwings can be hoarded up to 12. More drops including some decent 4* weapons and Wyrmprints on at least Story Mode Hard and higher tier daily dungeons. I am really happy they took note and tweaked it a bit. Still heavily relies on your luck factor with units (sometimes dragons) but it has improved from launch. 1* > 3*,3
Great game and a faithful concept.,5
really fun game,5
great,5
"After having played it more now, I'm willing to say it deserves a solid portion of the praises it receives. The movement controls can be troublesome at times, but still...",4
I've updated this game more than I've played it. it does however have a neat intro.,2
its really well done cute and charming love the music a pretty good arpg I'm enjoying it now if I could play it on my switch too lol,5
super fun it's so addictive and the fire emblem game makes it even more addicting. Can you do a fire emblem event for animal crossing pocket camp please!?!,5
it's fun,5
Had this game for a while and I love it. Only problem is the crashes I get. The fire emblem crossover has made it worse than ever! Please fix quick! My phone is fine.,3
"Honestly, one of the better gacha games I've played in terms of story and content. And the developers have been continuously adding QoL updates since the game was released, which is always a plus!",5
amazing,5
"It's a fun game and all, but the fact that it can and will crash at any given oppurtunity is abhorrent. I will gladly raise my review score when the issue is resolved.",2
came for the fire emblem promo stayed for the characters,5
"only reason I downloaded was the FE crossover, but I'm definitely here to stay. gameplay is very enjoyable and character sprites are charming and keep me coming for more.",5
A very fun Real Time RPG with a decent Gacha element.,5
Love it!,5
i think this game is wonderful,5
good,5
after changing my setting to 2D and lower graphic quality. I bo longer get dc from co-op.,5
"Great game, fun gameplay. The story is interesting and i want to get through it rather than feeling like a slog. Its not hard to play for free, just the very begining is a bit slow when you dont pay anything but after about midway the story isnt really any help anymore either so thats a win in my book. Two issues that keep it from getting five stars from me though. First it cant download updates in the background like every other app in existence. Second, there is no horizontal screen option.",4
a newbie but enjoying the game so far : ),4
"Great animation, bgm, storyline.",5
fun and awesome animations.,5
gacha is pretty forgiving and lot better now. i finally decided to start for real and the new rewards right now are crazy for the FE EVENT for new and old players alike.,5
very fun RPG. Nintendo didn't great job here.,5
really good game and is f2p friendly,5
This is AAA grade quality game and I am so invested in it.,5
its fun to play,5
The devs has been extremely supportive of this game. One of the best RPG and Gacha game out there. Interesting characters and story to boot.,5
goog game,4
"The most generous gacha game you'll ever play. Combat is simple tap dodge and hold, but goes deep with equipment. Lovely story, brilliant art and characters",5
trash cant even get in,1
everytime I try to do a coop quest the game freezes. I'm not sure if you've adressed this issue but I would like it to be fix. thanks in advance,3
"Honestly, this is a very fun game, the only downside is that it lags so much and it feels like I'm playing a test beta, that problem is the only one needed it to be fixed, everything else is pretty good",4
Pretty fun so far. Not that far in though.,5
NICE!,4
"I played it because of the crossover with Fire Emblem event, I glad I got Marth in the gotcha with welcome bonus gem, I still at the very beginning of the gameplay now, so I can't tell much if the game is good or not, but the graphic, artwork and voice are excellent, it is nintendo standard",4
Great game play and graphics,5
"Fantastic game with fantastic support from the developers. For all of the gifts they give and varied game modes that they've created for the game, they deserve every bit of praise that comes their way.",5
"weird movement controls, a bit laggy but still a fun game",4
"Other some laggy issues sometimes though lowering the visual settings down a bit, the game's pretty decent.",4
"So I install the game, then I have to download 900mb, play the game for 5 minutes, then have to download another 1gb. What? That 5 minutes was hardly even worth 100mb. Sorry, have to install. Characters and enemies are all black anyway.",1
Game has had a great update with the change to how summons works on top of a 300 discount to the cost to summon plus some QoL changes this game is amazing. They're really generous with wyrmstones on top of all the 10 fold summon tickets they hand out.,5
Fun.,5
Detailed game with lots of potential,5
Really nice game with great character designs. Simple and fast combat makes game thats easy to get into. A larger variety of equipment and skills for each character to use in combat would make it even better.,4
Fun so far,5
These production values are crazy good!,5
good,5
Wow the game got better fivestar for me then,5
needs to take less space,3
Very cool and well made Action RPG published by Nintendo.,5
Pretty cool. Marth demolishes everything!,4
fun but repetitive,3
The frame rate is too low. The game is great but the frame rate also ruins the experience for me.,4
"It keeps crashing! it's fun, but it the loading screen basically takes half the time before it crashes...",2
Amazing!,5
I love the story and the graphics but I Especially love the music I love how upbeat the game is and how cool the characters look altogether this is a fantastic game,5
I didn't get fjorm or marth,1
"never played a dragalia game, and this is an amazing introduction. insane customizability, cute graphics, and simple but satisfying game play. If you enjoy fire emblem heroes you'll probably enjoy this.",5
"The BEST gatcha game on the market. Fun game play, amazing developers.",5
awesome visuals and good game play....down side....not good on storage of phones...it huge....but very fun game to play and wonderful music,5
enjoying so far,5
"This app has great potential, anime and manga fans will thourghly enjoy. However I don't find it easy to pick up, which i consider very important for a mobile game. the battles are short enough to be enjoyable, but the rest of the game seems to be trying to get you to not play the battles, with so many distractions new users might feel intimidated. Gameplay itself is enjoyable, yet the game allows you to get new dragons without even beating the fist chapter, which feels wrong to me.",3
better than dc,5
its a great game just you have to download lots of stuff when there is a new story,5
This is the best rpg game I've played in a while. keep up the good work Nintendo,5
"Phenomenal presentation is what gives this game the edge over other gachas for me. Everything from the beautiful portrait art, to the adorable character models, to the amazing soundtrack makes me want to keep playing this game.",5
hella fun,5
love it,5
A fun game but frame rate drops hold it back from its true potential. overall a good game though,3
"very well made, clean character movements, lacking in versatility but stomps most mobile games in combat quality.",4
fun and keeps you Interested,5
"came for feh, stayed for the game play :3",5
It's a gacha. I wasn't expecting much. But imagine saving months for a single event and only getting pity-broken at 7.5% *repeatedly*. I've saved for 5 months and did a few little events with absolutely no Fire Emblem characters other than the free one they gave to show for it. What a waste of time. Cute story though.,2
Over all great game which is why I'm giving it a 5 however the moving and attacking are a little difficult the moving having the issue of that massive arrow and the attacking not always locking on.,5
Great game and developers listen.,5
That install eats up your data and doesn't even install with regular wifi. can't even play the game because it jacked up my data in like five minutes,1
"It's a great game, my only complaint is how many downloads there are but other than that it's fun, and the fact its crossing over with FE Heroes as well us what's got me interested right now",4
one of the kindest devs you will experience,5
veronica ty for granting me a chance to enjoy this game I was here on release but there was no fun in it.,5
fun game although I lost my first profile enjoyed it enough to redownload it and looking forward to go through it twice!,5
Very good game,5
So much fun! would love to see Nintendo make a whole franchise of this game!,5
so far a really comfy experience,4
"Classic RPG feel, simple controls, overall a fun game.",5
good,3
Really easy gameplay! Super fun and addicting!,5
Fun,5
Greeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat game.,5
Played a couple hours so far but seems pretty solid.,4
give me what I want and I'll make it 5,1
I like it. wish it stop crashing though.,5
"pretty fun, more enjoyable than FEH",5
Pretty good,5
not sure how I feel about the controls yet. They feel a bit awkward but the game is fun and visually very cool.,4
The developers are really generous with QOL life changes and currency. The game is fun.,5
Pretty good so far. Kind of odd that it downloads each mission separately. I'll update my review once i play more though!,4
You should add more diffren weapons and dragons aother than that it very fun,5
this game is fun,5
that's pretty pretty good,5
"So far I'm having a good time. Still a beginner, but its holding my attention well enough. Music and art is cool, and they gave out a lot of currency for new players.",4
good gameplay other than the movement mechanics are too long to maximize the speed,4
I've played a lot of gacha games and the rates in this are just dreadful. The amount of summons you actually get is quite generous but getting constant duplicates and 3* trash kinda sucks the fun out - and I have very few unique units as it is. Duplicates of adventurers feels particularly worthless as you can't even use them for anything; it just gives you 1 of the several million currencies. The game is very polished and there's tons to do but it's just not quite *there*,2
"I really, really like this game. It's pretty, the music is amazingly catchy, and it's fun to level up. What's not fun, however, are the summoning rates. Something desperately needs to be done about them, in this latest event, I have done in total 150 summons, and I got 1 5 star dragon I already had. I appreciate it's a gacha game, but events are supposed to make me keen to play like ""I wonder what I'll get next!"", not ""I already have all this even though there's a million other things to get"".",3
"Very good so far, simple and fun",5
Recent changes have made the game much better for free players,5
good,5
Great story and characters. Is a blast so far and handles well,5
"Very fun game for the little ive played of it. The music is beautiful, the art is amazing, and the story has drawn me in.",5
it is great and entertaining. but size hurt your storage,4
cool,5
its lit,5
Giant lady makes me go YAHOO,5
Absolutely amazing,5
The combat is amazing but the game takes up a lot of space.,4
"I'm changing my review from 2* to 5*. I applaud the developers for listening to players. Thank you for all of the changes from removing wymprints from the summoning pool, reducing the cost of summoning, upping abilities usage, x2 gameplay speed, improved coop and much more. I love the game and the fact that you used player feedback to improve the game makes me like it even more!",5
I just started playing today and it's pretty enjoyable game so far even if the paths forward are pretty linear.,3
"I love this game and I simply adore playing with my friend online. It's a game where we can play together and the fact thst Wyrmprints can no longer be summoned is very helpful. I don't like the fact that Fire Emblem is encorporated into the game however, not a huge fan of it.",4
really enjoy playing this. love the auto play feature so i can still grind while busy at work,5
really fun game,5
AMAZING.,5
So fun and the music is so cute I can't even handle it. Quickly becoming a favorite.,5
amazing,5
concept is good but very laggy and frequent downloads for each chapter so takes interest away,2
The devs are very generous and the graphics are so good.,4
I really like the game but I have to stop after the third 1 gig download. I'm all for big games but maybe take this one to a console.,3
"Game is really fun, i love the chibi and almost cartoony feel that you get from the game, the music is a great match. The cast of characters are pretty good as well. And the art is really cute too. Gatcha system for s too bad. Only thing is maybe the controls for walking, it'll take some getting used to. Other than that good game. 🐣",5
for the music alone it made this game sick I love Daoko,5
👌,5
"Game is too grind-heavy for my tastes, but there are so many rewards and freebies that being f2p doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do.",4
graet game,4
Really fun and pretty generous but if you dont like grinding for stuff then might want to stay away,4
Great idea and enjoyed playing the fact it is free to play A+++ but 4gb+ is too much space i keep have to delete things so had too uninstall. loading time is too long for areas.,3
It seems pretty fun. But the summoning cost seems like alot and the fact you have 3 different things to summon all in one go is a but annoying. They should split it up so one focuses on dragons and another one focuses on heros.,4
I love the story and I'm a huge fan of RPG games,5
love the art style,5
"Well made game that's fun to play, when it works. I often have trouble with it loading and I have been booted from coop a whole lot. I'll keep playing in hopes that they fix the issues Edit: they have fixed most of the issues that i have encountered and are very active in fixing problems stated by players and otherwise! This is an excellent game, i recommend it!",5
LITERALLY FIRE EMBLEM FATES,5
similar to granblue but sleeker. well balanced for their gacha currency.,4
nice gameplay and cute,5
i like Fjorm in this.,5
good game,5
Awesome here collector game! Great story and voice acting as well!,5
"probably the most generous, balanced, and entertaining gacha rpg Ive played",5
Cygames actually listens to player feedback. The games is 10x better than it was at launch,5
"Great dev team, plenty of opportunities and fun events! Im sure there are many more amazing things to come!",5
😁,5
Good beginner gacha game,5
Dragons!!!,5
FEH was better,4
still long loading time,4
nintentho,5
cool game,5
big h,4
I love this game right now! The only sad part is that it's not on the Switch😭💖,5
"Nintendo gets in on the Waifu gatcha racket. Cute waifus and Husbandos, and the game itself is pretty fun too.",5
"While it is a gacha game, it is incredibly generous and the developers put a lot of effort in the game. Alright graphics and fun gameplay",5
"its actually a good game and half (if not more) of the poor reviews are people complaining about issues that I'm pretty sure are related to their phones I have a Galaxy S9 and the game runs smoothly. The rates for gala adventures are kinda crazy but so far there is only two of them and they arent necessary at all, but other then that the rates are good and the game gives you a decent amount of wyrmite and summon vouchers if you dont waste them on banners that arent worth it.",5
love units and the upgrade to make on their weapons. so good.,5
"Ignore people complaining about character or dragon rates, some of the best fun comes out of making a character stronger on this game. There's no pvp implimented, and with that, no need to complain about 5* characters having better abilities than three or four stars.",4
Great game,5
The game just keeps getting better with each update!,5
one of the best if not the best gacha games around. absolutely worth your time.,5
"amazingly fun gacha game, with dragon morphing combat",5
Great game! Really fun to play and with great story and character designs.,5
"Finally! I've been waiting to play this game for forever, wasn't out for Pixel phones. It's a lot of fun so far, cool characters and dragons, story seems nice, mechanics aren't to bad. Should get.",5
fun so far. decent devs. not overly greedy.,4
"Pretty cool game. Downloaded it because I ended up giving in to my friend always asking me to play a game every month. Turns out, he deleted the game, but, I'm still playing till this day.",5
its pretty good,5
very good game. the developer is keen to improve the game according to feedbacks from player.,5
"The gameplay and progression style is well put together. The interface isn't overwhelming, yet there is a lot of different aspects of the game you can build and work upon so you always feeling like your progressing forward.",5
"Great music, fun gameplay and funny characters. This collaboration between Cygames and Nintendo is a match made in heaven. Add to all of that a friendly, timely, and responsive development team, and there isn't a phone game out there that compares.",5
"i like this game a lot. Been playigng everyday for the past two months since I downloaded. Lots of quests and events. Only sad part is if you miss the event character, cant get it any more forever...",4
Great app game by nintendo. great story line.. updates consistently on time and nice rewards for anything ! also fair free play and pay too play balance which is very rare to find. great prices as well. not pocket breaker. Only thing this game needs and missing is communication with other people. I would love to chat or have more stickers (maybe buy some for 1$). Last thing but not least no guilds.,5
Addicting very fair with in game currency and pretty good with summoning 5* compared to other games I've played,5
reminds me of fire Emblem,5
check this one out its good,5
"loving it, it's my go to game",5
great game,5
"Dragalia is the child of the union between two powerhouses for gaming, and it shows. The game is crisp, fun, and interesting with a detailed story and a wellspring of depth and content. The game naturally has a bug or two here since it's brand new, but so far the devs have been quick to acknowledge them. There is a bit of grinding involved but it wouldn't be Cygames if there wasnt.",5
Wow!,5
"Absolutely awful pool to draw from. It's bloated with small stat-boosting cards that almost entirely prevent you from pulling 5☆ characters or dragons, the MAIN POINT of draws.",4
"Update: I've had a lot of fun with this one and the developers keep adding a lot of great quality of life changes. 5 stars. A fun game, and english voice actors are nice to have. Suffers from typical gacha issues, in that there is no certain way for you to get a character that clicks with you aside from luck, and the odds are most certainly against you. Even still, high production value and constant updates have made it worth playing thus far. We'll see how they fight off the grindy feel.",5
"I can't ask for more from a mobile game, especially with the recent summoning changes (no more wyrmprints!).",5
YAH YAH YAH BRO BRO BRO jungkook is my favorite 5 star adventurer ANY ARMY HERE 👌😂😂😂😂,5
one of the best gacha games out there big facts,5
its honestly alot better than i expected. story is great and fighting mechanics are simple yet fun to use!,5
fun game,5
Came back to this game recently after hearing about the upcoming FE event. Most of the issues I had with the game at launch have been addressed and the dev team is amazing. This is turning into a real gem of a gacha game that more people need to play.,5
I feel it's a bit to early into the game for a review but I'm here for the fire emblem heroes event!,4
"Not only is this game fantastic in itself and very generous to f2p players, but the dev team has made countless quality of life improvements, and implemented multiple requested features since launch. From making menus easier to navigate, to removing things from the summoning pool that felt bad to get, and even decreasing the costs to summon by 20%! They actually listen to feedback and strive to constantly improve the game. Every update is a very pleasant surprise that goes above and beyond!",5
This game has the best developer team I have ever seen in all the gacha games I have played. They listen to their players and the community and work to continuously improve the game.,5
Yeet Yeet Yeet Yeet Yeet,5
"What a fantastic game! The biggest plus about this game is that the developers are very generous. They listen to the players. the gameplay is great and gets you involved. Hunting for characters and grinding towards that ""endgoal"" has been fun. Definitely would recommend.",5
thumbs up,5
"best mobile game I've ever played. interactive, great writing, great characters and developers that actually listen to their players",5
"Dragalia Lost peeked my interst when it came out but I naturally pushed it off, recently with the upcoming FEH crossover I thought i'd give it a go. The game was enjoyable for what I managed to play and it seemed like it would be lots of fun however the fact that it requires over 2GBs ruins the game for me. It would be an amazing game if it was on a more apportiate platform such as the Switch.",3
"Game has been really fun to play. Constant improvements to UI, content, modes and rewards. Active developer responses to player concerns. On top of fun gameplay, easy-to-access co-op, amazing music and a clean little ARPG. Oh and DRAGONS!!!!",5
"Amazing, i love almost everything about this game. The graphics, the music, the characters. The amount of content in this game is unbelievable, definitely my favorite gacha game, by far.",5
"Great artwork and audio, excellent gameplay, generous and responsive dev team; this game has it all and more!",5
hard to get into but fun,5
fun. a bit slow at times tho,5
"Pro: it looks fantastic, seems pretty well balanced, the action is quite fun once you get a feel for it, and it doesn't milk you for money. Con: demands a decent device, and crashes a lot even then. Takes a bit of getting used to. The story is generic and it's laid on very thick in the first few hours. There's a massive amount of flipping through party management menus and the upgrade game feels a bit like playing a spreadsheet.",5
this is an amazing game but it takes so much space,5
If you like playing gacha games that are actually fun you should definitely pick it up.,5
excellent graphic and control. awsome gaming experience.,5
"Too Large. My device can't handle gigabytes. I am so hype for the Fire Emblem crossover event, but I can't even play the game due to how large the download is. If there was a data lite version like Fire Emblem Heroes had, I could probably enjoy it like everyone else, but sadly, I can't experience the game like I had hoped.",1
"Sarisse is awesome. If you get her, you have been blessed.",5
"If you want a great game but are not willing to spend money on a gatcha system, then this is for you. All in-game content can be cleared with free characters! PROS: Great characters. Lots of free in-game currency. Prompt fixes to any bugs. Devs that actually listen to player suggestions and strive to improve the game above and beyond what is expected. Honestly, it's a great game. Well worth trying out at the very least.",5
Best game ever.,5
Proactive development team that adresses balance and is overall generous.,5
awesome,5
so fun,5
"Easily the best gacha game I've ever played, if you like action rpg mechanics and it looks like your style, do yourself a favor and play.",5
I love the game since the bug has been fixed. I just wish my luck was higher to get 5 stars lol.,5
"Very fun, but plenty of depth. The developers are listening to the community and continue to make big changes to the game and economy, which were fine before, but now even better. And they're so generous with free stuff as well!",5
it's a really engaging gatcha RPG!,5
Great game with good devs that change the game to be better every patch.,5
"I've played all of the available chapters so far (04/25/19) and I really love this game! The difficultly progression from each level makes sense, the gameplay is comprehensive, the story intriguing, and the artwork fun. The energy recharge time isn't ridiculous and co-op is an interesting (optional) feature that also makes it easier to play without spending money, which I really appreciate. The on-going updates have mostly been in response to user feedback and have only improved the game.",5
crazily generous!!,5
This game looks and sounds great.,4
"Fun game. gave 5 stars originally, but the new party matching options are not as good.",4
cool,5
best game company,5
"It's a good game, will change to 5 stars if they can fix the purchase bug. (ERROR 24001) Otherwise, pretty fun and amazing voice overs and music :) Edit: I actually want this game to succeed. They said they'll patch this so I'm giving it a 5 Star. Edit: Dec 17th 2018 They fixed the error code!",5
Very generous devs,5
love it,5
"The game won't load, just a black screen with a tiny white dot in the middle",1
Good game!,5
Must play!,5
Perfect game,5
"high quality mobile game. if i could play this game on PC or portable console, i would.",5
"Good game, but unfortunately I dont have the storage to keep playing it.",4
One of the best and most generous gacha games I've ever played.,5
perfect!,5
FEH BTFO.,4
I've upped my review from 4 * to 5* as the developer continues to show initiative in making their game more accessible to F2P and improving game mechanics. it is a solid game that I enjoy each day.,5
pretty good,5
Game is great to play.,5
"Very Simple and easy to get along with. The story is amazing and there's always something to do. All I ask is that you can maybe tweak down the difficulty on some the EX stages please and also fix the ""Auto"" function for during quests so that our chosen characters don't blindly run into obstacles like idiots",4
Great updates and very generous,5
"they love their player base and actually listen to and care about us. if you only play one of this kind of game in your life, make sure its this version",5
Best consumer friendly game out there. Tons of content and an incredible development team that is willing to listen to the fans instead of being a cash grab.,5
wow. this might be the most generous gacha game i've ever played.,5
"been playing for a month. devs are great with updates. has gatcha so ymmv. no pvp, instead co-op :). good amount of rest between events. nice music and eng voice acting. online community is really friendly.",5
An incredibly fun game made by incredibly generous/communicative devs.,5
Genuinely floored by the amount of improvement not just in the past year but the last month alone. Massive QoL updates across the board and the most sweeping changes to a gacha system I've seen. Cygames is absolutely killing it.,5
"solid grindy fun tapping gameplay, devs respond super quick in game to player feedback. Very enjoyable experience for me since launch day at a daily filthy casual, mildly f2p pace.",5
pretty fun even as f2p,5
"first time iv left a review for a game that didnt reward you for leaving a review lol. but this game. they do it right. its fun, the character designs are nice and art over all is very satisfying. plus nintendo is seriously listening to the players and updating the game to make them happy. everytime i see a new update note and they just shower you with gifts its like having a sugar daddy. im excited to see what they do in the future.",5
luv it,5
BEST GAME EVER please improve 5 star rates thanks!,4
amazing f2p game. support the dev's simply due to their constant generosity.,5
devs love us,5
Best Mobile Game I have ever played!,5
"this game is very f2p friendly and has a superb track record of listening to its userbase. in the 6 months the app has been out, many changes were made that made the game more enjoyable and most changes were requested by users. There are also multpile instances of gifts from the developers. as far as mobile games go, this is worth the large download site, haha ~",5
"This game is amazing. Whenever there are complaints about the UI of the game they will almost always get back to you. Additionally, when there are bugs or something changes drastically in the game the developers ensure gifts are given to the players who experienced these difficulties or changes. I would recommend this game for anyone who loves loot games, and as a fan of Borderlands 2, I can say that this game measures up to it.",5
"Great gameplay, rewarding progression even as a f2p player.",5
best game,5
Devs are improving the game constantly and constantly rewarding players!,5
"Excellent game; very fun to play, nice music and voice actors. Great customer service, with constant updates. Co-op needs some work but Cygames have prove that they listen to feedback. EDIT: as of April 26th, they have revamped the gacha removing one element permanently from the pool (wyrmprints) and lowering the costs of pulling. Cygames/Nintendo are going all out with this game listening to the fanbase, some other gacha games devs should learn from this move.",5
Most generous and fun mobile game by far.,5
Nifty little game.,5
The friendliest and most generous gacha game out there with a great story and cast of characters to boot.,5
Good game ^_^,5
"The game itself is fun, engaging, and challenging. The perfect balance. However, what really makes this game stand apart from the parade of junk available is the support and constant updates from the developer. I've never played a mobile game that had the level and consistency of the communication we get from CYgames. It's impressive.",5
目前嚟講係一隻好啱單手玩嘅RPG，畫面靚。任天堂出品就係唔同,5
"Generous gacha with low summoning costs, better rewards than most, and combat that's more than button mashing.",4
mea,3
connection always fails,1
"Engaging coop experience (Especially High Dragon Trials), extremely generous developers who give great importance to player feedback, beautiful design with top notch voice acting and engrossing gameplay.",5
Another luck based game.,5
"Great production value, lots of loot, and other incentives to keep playing. Loving this game so far. Feels like a lite-console RPG.",5
"I love it overall, the cute style, the rhythmic menu, the story so far. I couldn't help but to leave a positive review.",4
Best mobile game on the market,5
Fun coop gacha game with an extremely generous publisher.,5
"Fun. I stopped playing for a bit do to lack of content, but they seem to be resolving that issue.",4
great game with a consistent progression,5
Wish I could play on a bigger screen every words so tiny.,5
it good,4
"One of the best gacha games on the market. They constantly update with new QoL features and are quick to address issues, and are generous with currency. Great job Cygames, and I hope to see many years with this game.",5
I have picked up the game again after a 2 month break and changed my rating of on it. I feel this game is finally moving in the right direction and am happy to see so many issues I had with the game fixed. If the game continues to impress me I will come back and give it a 5* rating. Edit: after announcing the removal of wymprints and lowering of summon cost I've changed my rating to 5*. Cygames totally deserves it.,5
Fun and f2p friendly. Great game,5
"A game as generous, as it is engaging and fun to play, with a welcoming community as well. my favorite mobile game, above FEH and FGO",5
"This game has me hooked, great combat, story, music, and gameplay overall. This game has the best devs and is very free to play friendly.",5
Best dev in this market.,5
awesome game,5
Best. Gatcha. Game. Ever. This company partnered with Nintendo make the best combination for the player base. They are consistently making changes in the players favor along with giving out gifts to keep all the playerbase happy. The first non toxic universally happy community I have been a part of.,5
Well managed and very generous game. Good story and characters. Top notch game,5
"Co-op is always a plus, very f2p friendly, the most generous devs I've ever seen, and nice plot so far in an ongoing campaign. Controls for ranged units might take time getting used to, but otherwise most mechanics are easy to learn. I look forward to the future of this game.",5
The gameplay is fun although the controls takes some time getting used to. The devs are generous with gifts relative to other gacha games. The upcoming changes to the summoning system are incredible and fixes the complaints I had. The devs here are honestly so much better than the other gacha games I've played.,5
"I cannot shut up about this game. My friends and family are annoyed with me. This is a little mobile game with micro-transactions, and it ranks among my all time favorites beside big console names like Persona 4 and Tales Of Vesperia. I have no regrets putting money into this game, just to show my support. The paid content is not at all necessary to get a leg up or enjoy the game to its full extent. I love the developers so much, and everything about this game.",5
"Used to love playing Rune Story so im really glad you guys brought it back, but better. great job love this game",5
great so far,5
這世界上怎麼可以......有這麼佛的遊戲啦啦啦！！！對新手友善，甚至願意因應玩家的聲音修正卡池，石頭也送的不少，我的天，這遊戲也太佛了吧。,5
Can't play anymore after a recent game or phone update. Just keep showing error code 160. Contacting support is useless as they do not provide a solution to the problem.,1
better than expected,5
gud,5
if you love dragons and a good story telling game with knights and magic.This is the game for you,5
it's a super cute game and is pretty generous. highly recommend.,5
wonderfull,5
great game,5
Decent game with fairly easy gameplay controls but it eats at your battery life pretty heavily.,4
Fun game so far. enjoying my time. lots to do.,4
cute chae,5
the game is fun but having an error 160 issue. if this persist... my grp of friends will not be continuing to play this game any longer....,3
getting error 160.. unable to log in for quite some time now,1
great game,5
One of the best mobile games I've played. Very engaging gameplay and great end game content. Developers listen to the community and are always making improvements to the game. One of the most free-to-play friendly games I've played. A lot of free resources and adventurers are viable in the most difficult content so you aren't forced to buy diamantium to be able to do it.,5
this game is nice and they developers obviously listen to their playerbase,5
"I love this game and everything about it. cool pulls, nice overall aesthetic, but theres just one problem. last month or so I got a new phone and transferred everything to my new one. well since then? I keep getting user authentication error and it won't let me do ANYTHING. I just have to close the game out. anyone have a fix? or experience the same problem? I really wanna get back to playing.",4
"been playing for a week, and then apps start showing ""error code 160 connection issue"" even though i don't have problems with internet connection. And now i just can't login anymore If it's a bug please fix it, i love this game.",1
storyline is good,5
only phone game worth playing. developers are very generous and there is always something going on.,5
too much lag and just bad overall,1
"the game is fun but it is a big file, like in the gigabytes. The problem I am having is that the game has to download more any time I want to play. I did the batch download but for some reason it still makes me download to play chapters each time. I don't think the game is terrible, it does have good points like the story is interesting, the game play is fun, and the art is cute.",3
Its aight,4
super fun,5
So far the game has been great. I am sure I will be grinding for items in no time,5
"awesome game,but thats to be expected from cygames",5
good,5
"The game won't work for me it just says ""authentication failed"" when i try to play, even with the contact support",4
can never connect anymore,1
If you want to play a game where developers listen to its community then this is the game. They are also generous with in-game currency. Join the FB group for beginner's tips.,5
"I have a Samsung Galaxy S7, so it is more than capable to run a game like this yet this game has crashed more than 3 times in the first hour of playing",2
Pretty neat so far. Although some things aren't really explained like how summoning pools work.,4
feh cross over hype,5
Amazing game. Gacha is very generous,5
Is good so far,4
so far so good,5
great,5
good game,5
This game is addiciting.,5
AWSOME!!!!!!!!,5
Theres a reason why the community is growing so fast and it's because Dragalia is such a great game. Every new patch it is getting even better!,5
bad game just mad to take you money,1
One word to describe this app. amazing.,5
cool gamee!,5
"I got this game with the idea in mind to play a fun new gacha that nintendo endorses (wow) and what I got was an 800mb download in the playstore, a 2.5gb download (ok fair enough) but wait- for a PROLOGUE and MENU. After, you either download new content PER STORY MISSION or you go into the settings and download another 1.5gb, yay! this doesnt even include future content. gacha rates for 5 stars are terrible. if you want a good gacha just play azur lane or granblue. dont waste your time.",1
fun game. great story,5
No game has pulled me in as much as this game. I have been playing since it launched and havent stopped. It is by far the fairest Free-to-play game. There is no pvp which rocks. Cygames is super generous with the free summons. You can see the effort and heart they put into this game. I dont see myself stopping any time soon. Thanks for the awesome game!,5
Turn up your volume. These songs are beautiful.,5
it's a fun gotcha game by Nintendo.,5
good,5
"I REALLY love this game! There's a lot to do with out it being too overwhelming. I really enjoy the events and I like how the company is listening to the players. I took a break from it for a few months (personal illness that made it difficult to look at screens) came back & noticed a lot of good changes in just the short time I was gone. I hope this game continues to grow & thrive. People quitting it makes me a little nervous, so I hope the company doesn't lose hope.",5
good gake,5
so good graphic and songs.. reminded of my childhood RPG games in the original PS.,5
"excellent combat, music is good and doesn't grate on you.",5
good lol. nothing less.,5
cool,5
lots of fun,5
Its good and its fun and I enjoyed it. The characters were good to,5
this is an amazing game! I started looking for a game like this once monster strike shut down. my wife and friends gather every night to run the avenues and other various events. since the beginning of this game it's been amazing and constantly improving. keep up the work devs!,5
"Dragalia Lost has an amazing story, beautiful art, and has simple, yet filling, gameplay. The summon rates are more fair than most others, and Wyermite is easily attainable. Multiplayer is fun and you ACTUALLY get to play in real time with other people! And unlike most mobile games I've played, this actually takes feedback and listens to it! I TOTALLY recommend downloading!",5
really fun gatcha. but what really shines Re the developers. They really listen and make changes based on community comments and suggestions.,5
bull faeces,1
good,5
The most fun and generous Gacha I've ever played. I love it.,5
"Great gacha, very F2P! Been here sense the start.",5
The game runs well when you're actually playing but the menu is so damn slow. It's ranging from 15-30fps. Tapping to get around different menus take 2-4 seconds each time. There's nothing worse than an unresponsive menu.,2
make a 7 deadly sins summoning event,5
great game,5
good,5
would love to play this game but it lets me dowmload enough to play the entro. then it needs to download more ...just too big for my phone,2
Nice,5
awesome game,5
I've played since launch and spent a total of 20 dollars. I have nearly all the five star units and dragons along with an abundance of premium and freemium currency due to the devs generosity. The game is responsive and almost refuses to let you pay money to fully enjoy the experience. The game deserves every bit of praise that it is recieving.,5
AAAAAA,5
It looks fun but it requires a phone/device with a infinity worth of space which doesn't really exist so I didn't really get to enjoy it past the beginning which is really too bad.,4
I'll be honest this is the only mobile game that I have enjoyed playing so an easy 5 star game for me,5
Great game!!,5
Abysmal drop rate. Another Cygame grinding RPG.,1
i like it at first but then it got worse the game was slow on last setting not my phone proble because it runs fe heros just fune and animal crossing,3
good,4
got stale and boring same thing over and over but the gameplay was okay at most graphics appealable,3
"I'm not a fan of having to constantly load more and more, even before opening the app for the first time it was already one of my largest apps. good bye.",2
"This game is amazing, from the vibrant soundtrack and artwork to the smooth, responsive and fun controls and gameplay, this is easily the best mobile game I've ever played. The only issue I have is the cost of the microtransactions. 35 dollars for what essentially amounts to a single tenfold summon? That's just too high and it's a shame because, while you never NEED to pay for anything to have a great time, I'd really love to spend more on this game but it's hard to justify when it costs so much",4
Great game! Especially to past the time!,5
amazing game great graphics I'm loving it Nintendo you did it again,5
eh,3
"Short, fun sessions with lots of events. Devs are responsive and fast. Rates are terrible, but even 3* units can clear just about everything. Edit: summoning will be revamped! The number of QOL changes have been insane.",5
great,5
enjoyable and great graphics,5
eh,3
Been playing since launch. Developers constantly update and improve the game. Frequent events and events always give good stuff. Great translation work and english voices are very good. Moderately F2P friendly you dont need SSR characters to do the hardest content; having SSRs help but the game is 90% skill. Warning very grindy game; play for the long term. Co-op is great; it helps you get through tough spots. Overall great experience recommended for gacha fans.,5
"Excellent story, graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack.",5
its a fun game with fun mechanics but the movement can be improved,4
I absolutly love this game,5
Great,5
Great game! Good fun. Generous devs who reward players with Social media campaigns and anniversary events. Worth your time!,5
This is a great game omg having so much fun and the music is good totally having lots of feeling with this great game. giving 4* and not full because i wish that the game bring in more fun things in future. God Bless this game,4
Has a little frame drops here and there but is a steady game,4
Very well made game with simple yet great controls. Decent graphics and a fairly smooth frame rate. Great Job Nintendo!!!,5
"My favorite gacha game of all time! The devs are very generous with giving out free stuff, and all of the content is accessible to f2p players. Any 5-star summons are more of a want than a need. The game is based around player skill and knowledge instead of needing the best skills or stats of the characters to be relevant. There is a fair bit of grinding involved, but it doesn't really get too boring. All in all, a great game.",5
I'm having a blast.,5
"Game either crashes, fail to connect or lags. Very poor performance game. Gameplay is good though.",1
good game lots of loading screens but fun nevertheless,4
great game,5
Honestly one of the best models for a gatcha game I've ever played. Devs are continually making changes to benefit players.,5
too much gigabytes and i only have a little but looked okay,4
"Very open to feedback, extremely generous, and fun to play. However it is pretty grindy so unless you like that sort of gameplay it may not be for you.",5
"Controls could be improved along with ally AI but those are my only problems with this game, I absolutely love it! Edit: 6 months later and this is by far the best mobile gotcha - developer is incredibly generous and listens to player feedback then actually makes changes. AI is better and controls have been improved.",5
cute char.. nice game,5
very nice,4
awesome 👍😁,5
"One of the most responsive game devs I've ever seen. they inplement so many QoL changes that players have wanted, ehoch goes to show that they have long term plans for this game. Gameplay is interesting with great story and even greater voice acting. Although the game is currently still young, I believe that their attention to detail is already at an absurd level compared to other games.",5
"Great game to play! Gacha rates are a bit low but they will be removing wyrmprints from the summoning pool next update so REJOICE! Cygames is also very generous with their handouts making the game an easy ftp pickup. My only real complaint would be the lack of variety and heavily grind gated fights, which is being addressed, albeit slowly.",5
fun and charming gatcha by a very generous company,5
"Even though I just started playing I absolutely love the concept art, and gameplay.",5
"tl;dr: The dev team are competent and respond to feedback HARD. I love it. More: Fantastic gameplay, charming cast and developers that are both diligent and competent. Shoutout to the excellent localization, which provides excellent english voice direction and entertaining writing. A quality gacha experience, though somewhat gated due the long grind to reach endgame.",5
Great and the most generous game ever!,5
good game well played,5
gatcha rates are horrible spent a fair bit on this game and all I get is repetitive same 5 star adventure with 3 star adventures. I hope they are reading this and do something gatcha system. gameplay is alright,2
"Pretty good f2p game The graphics (animation) and music is really good. Gameplay is easy to learn and they been adding new features every so often. Takes a bit of farming to raise up characters for end game trials and bosses (5k+ might/character). It was getting a little boring but now content comes out more often and new features. Summoning 5* characters kind of sucks, no duplicates and wyrmprints troll the pulls. But i got most 5*s and havent spent a penny, so yeah its pretty good.",4
"Love, the game. Kinda wish diamantium wasn't crazy expensive.",4
Been playing since launch and have been loving it especially with the upcoming changes to summoning (they're removing prints from summoning) I love Cygames and I can't wait for the FEH collab.,5
amazing game. developers are very responsive to feedback. so far the game is looking strong in its first 6 months.,5
"this is straight up the best, most humane take on a gacha i have ever witnessed. whenever i think of a way for them to improve the experience the devs already have something up their sleeves even better. it helps the game itself is actually pretty fun too.",5
"The dedication the game developers have to listening to and engaging with the player base is unprecedented for me. Every time an update is released, it seems, the change log is loaded with changes or fixes requested by the community. As far as free to play friendliness, I can't imagine a more supportive developer.",5
"Beautiful game and plot to go along with it, with characters you'll immediately grow attached to.",5
"I honestly feel very disappointed in myself that I didn't start playing this game until months later. This game is probably one of the funniest app games I've played. Great characters, great story, and the team/devs are very nice and understanding. I don't regret playing this game.",5
Love this game! Cygames actually listens to the player base and are extremely generous.,5
fun game,5
waifu > meta,5
This game sucks. The mobility of the characters is abysmal. Response time is so slow. Casual game fail.,1
Game is pretty fun and cute. The QoL updates have been amazing and the developers have been making big changes to the game based on player feedback. Definitely worth checking out. The amount of free ingame currency keeps the game friendly to f2p players.,5
great game,5
"Fantastic game. The best experience I've had with a mobile title. Great art, great music, fun gameplay and I never feel pressured to spend money. Totally recommend it",5
ty for removing wp,5
Best Phone Game,5
DRAGALIA WON! TONS OF FUN AND VERY GENEROUS. Over the course of the past 6 months this game has undergone many changes and improved things based on massive user feedback. We get tons of premium currency for free from the developers and during events it really is the most comfy mobage.,5
"Love the game. The UI is very aesthetically pleasing, graphics are decent, combat is pretty fluid and intuitive imo. 3*-5* heroes are all usable if raised to similar lvls/gear, even more so after they changed it to a double wyrmprint system. Devs are really receptive to feedback and they know how to show they care. Their recent announcement to remove wyrmprints to reduce gacha pool dilution (and place them in a separate exchange) has cemented my faith in them. No gacha dev has done this before",5
"its been a lot of fun so far. i think the best part is that you can tell the devs are actually listening to what people want, which can't always be said for other games.",5
yay,5
this game is just what I expect from Nintendo. FUN!,5
"Runs smooth, great art great music",5
pretty dope so far,4
The developers deserve praise. Enough said.,5
"polished, storry driven & cute :)",5
absolutely amazing gacha game. dev's are very responsive and the game gets better constantly. a must download.,5
"Generous for a f2p mobile game, and the core gameplay is actually fun! Co-op is really cool. Pre-download all the assets while on wifi so you don't have to wait for as many loading screens.",5
Fun game! Game mechanics are solid and deep. Presentation is great and fits well with the game itself; along with catchy music to make the experience seem more unique. The gacha system rewards collecting adventures since you have no need of multiple copies; except for dragons.,5
"One of the best gacha games that I've played. The developers in this game really does listen to their community for plenty of QoL changes. They even recently removed wyvmprints/cards from the summoning pool and compensated everyone for any duplicates due to the changes in thr summoning system. It is also extremely f2p as this is a co-op game with the company giving plenty of freebies. I highly suggest giving this game a try, regardless of when you jump in as everyone tries to help each other out",5
Awesome game!,5
Theyre fixing the rates entirely. The event variety is growing steadily. Yeah just get this already. This game is the shining example of what mobile games should be,5
"Have you never seen a game dev of a gacha game make the gacha LESS oppressive? Well, these madmen did it. PRAISE CYGAMES.",5
very fun game.,5
"Very fun! Gives you alot to do. Alot of grind which is fun, not a game that gets boring fast .people need to understand that rating a game very low stars because of the co op or phones not running it, the game just came out so give them some time. it's a big game! This happenes with every game you play from ps4 to xbox 1. Give them the feedback they need to fix it but dont kill there stars because of it. Rating is about the quality of the game. Glitches will happen. the game is always improving",5
great game so far different than any of the others,5
"so cute, love the visuals and the story is easy to get into",5
wow....so much download for so little gameplay.,1
Nice,5
"It takes a long time to load when you have just got the game, but me and my brother are addicted.",5
A more involved gacha game with a focus on the gameplay instead of the stat management (although theres plenty of that too),4
"Not too complex, yet challenging enough to be lots of fun. Visuals are amazing, Epic story, I love the gatcha element, and they give away so much in-game currency I actually dont mind spending a little. Love this game!",5
"Fantastic Game I've been playing Dragalia Lost for quite some time (I downloaded the Japanese APK before the game was available in the west), and I have to say it's one of, if not the best mobile game I have ever played. The game can be enjoyed without paying a single penny, and the game is incredibly generous with its currencies that you use to buy summon vouchers, etc. Even if you have just a passing interest in Japanese Action RPGs, you should definitely check out this gem.",5
good game so far,4
"not a game, just a data hog I didn't even get to really play the game becaue it wants me to download the entire game every time to open the app. mobile games need to be quick and simple, this is a deal breaker for me",1
"great app, but seems to be having an issue with the touch not responding correctly out of the blue, where i touch on my phone screen seems to respond about 1cm higher in the app making the selections at the bottom of the screen useless (phone screen and every other game/app unaffected by this glitch/issue) have reched out via the help section and submitted a complaint but havent heard anything back in 4 days, quite slack im running on a razer phone 2 with high performance so cant be the phone",3
♡,5
Amazing game!,5
Very good 👍 game 👌 love the story line so far and I love the BGM the looks good too!,5
good game,5
amazing game one of the best i have played on mobile great graphics great layout enjoyable background music and summon rates are crazy good. but if they make another event where the boss is solo only i will delete this damn game. the A.I. is the trashest thing i have seen in my hole life of gaming (23 years) this Easter event boss is 12k might I have 17k all 5* characters and wyrmprints with the 2nd best weapons and two 5* dragons but the A.I. sucks that bad that i can't beat it so I miss out yay,3
Not bad from the first impressions,4
"most gacha games I've played have had very 2D(?) playstyles, but this is so close to an actual MMORPG I lose track of time!",5
"One of the major things that turn people off from this game is the size but don't let that fool you. The game has fantastic catchy music, the gameplay is simple and easy to learn. The double wyrmprint system allows you to have customizable builds. Summon rates for 5 stars are avg. but the developers are SUPER genourous. The community discord is extremely helpful for newer players.",5
great game,5
great stuff I love tacos,5
I've played for some time and it seems your luck severly goes down the more time you put into the game. Five 10 summon tickets and I got the same rare hero each time. Idk. Its really enjoyable at first but not really worth it after some time.,3
"Fantastic, fluid and engaging. Easy to pick up. Stunning visually and the soundtrack is gorgeous. Strongly recommend picking this up.",5
It is an amazing game love it 😍😍😍😍😍😗😗,5
fun,5
"1 month later and this is still my favorite game to play, although i am dealing with an issue where i can't connect for some reason",5
interesting and fun,5
GREAT GAME!,5
"i is change my review again from 5 stars to 2 stars, because i got two 5star wyrmprints instead of two 5 star units. i only got 1 5star unit, if i got two 5 star units i would give 5x2 stars but only got 5stars review max so if you gib me 1 more 5star unit i can only gib you 5star review. thx",2
An amazing game A true F2P gatcha game.,5
I like the Dragalia Lost,4
to many downloads,2
I love the game so cute so adorable and the dragons is simply amazing you guys really outdone yourselves wish I could give you 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 this many cause I love it so much.,5
higher framelimit would be nice,4
"This is incredible! Honestly, I can't even find words to describe this. All I can say is that it's really fun to play, it's absolutely beautiful, and I love the music! The controls are even fun too. :)",5
"One of my current favorite apps. story needs to be fleshed out more, but gameplay and overall quality is a major winner.",5
its a game,4
Fun,5
Terrible customer support. Will be the last time I support any Nintendo product. Account lost and no help provided.,1
buenardo,5
"Very good game. One star off for lack of warning on data loss. Link your game to a Nintendo account. If you don't and end up losing game data afterwards (e.g., phone wiped, phone stolen/loss, deleted game, etc), you won't be able to retrieve game progress and will start from the beginning. This is true even if your game is linked to a Google account.",4
this game would be much more enjoyable if it didnt keep crashing on me..,3
"A friend suggested me this game and just seconds with it I loved it. They are always improving the game which always turns out to make the game even better. The controls are simple and responsive. There are also no ads, making this game feel like a real console/pc game instead of a mobile game.",5
I like it alot.,5
Exceptional,4
"Objectively it's fine, well drawn and quality. But I don't personally enjoy it. Character designs are dull imo and game is not very fun.",4
it's pretty dope. music good! gameplay good! loot real good!,4
Awesome deserved more games likes this on the phones.,5
i give this game 6 stars if i could nice graphics great voice acting very smooth game play n great story keep up the good work,5
Finally a fun fast paste rpg!,5
i tried to sign in to my first account through Nintendo and i have nothing. I am having to start over from scratch so i dont see the point in having to link to the Nintendo account if it doesnt save my progress.,2
Addictive but worth the fun,4
Very fun game.,5
It's good.,5
Good visuals and great music. This game has been getting more and more support from the devs. That is why I am giving it 4 now. the pulls are still pretty bad but they at least added a one time use ticket to get any unit you want. I have been here since day 1 and I doubt I am leaving any time soon.,4
drop rate is a rumor 5star uhh sorry that doesn't exist,3
so far so good,4
"Dragalia Lost is simple to pick up, and offers a wide range of levels to challenge even the most dedicated players. Some in-app purchases feel quite expensive, but the game is very free-to-play friendly. Since the game's launch, there has been a steady flow of new content to keep things interesting.",5
Fun and addictive action RPG with intuitive controls. Incredibly generous compared to other gachas.,5
"Still early into this game, graphics are stunning, drop rates for summons seem good ( or I have been lucky) defiantly worth a play.",5
Amazing game lol the main character looks like meliodis a little bit😂,5
"beautiful and fun, with an amazing storyline but bogged down, like a lot of games (especially nintendo), by horrendous drop rates",4
"The game is decent so far, gameplay is smooth and interactive. Turning off auto is needed when fighting stronger bosses which is a good thing. However the game is still quite flawed. There is no auto when doing co-op even for easier stages. Lack of summoning choice without featured/banner characters. Extremely long cooldowns on skills that depend on a character's number of attacks. Lack of customization on weapon skills. Unbalanced enhancing materials - too little for weapons, too much for heros",4
fun and not p2w,4
love it its fun,5
"New player, is a good game... But good lawrd there is a lot of downloading to do, after installation - download the game, then the tutorial, then the content after the tutorial... Make sure your data packages are topped up!",4
"pretty great, but the performance can be better",5
pretty damn fun and a good time killer,5
"Well done Nintendo making a free game it has the quality of a Nintendo game, I love this game",4
"I really like the story so far, the gameplay is really nice, and the graphic are good for such a big mobile game",4
fun,5
"Fun game, recommended",5
this is an amazing game,5
"my experience has been fun as an off an on casual to daily player, my issue is how many microtrans bonus' you get. i also have a question to the devs as to the status ailments affliction rates. is it a threshold or is it a proc percentile? ive been stun-locked til death at least 30 times during this event when i still had goood amounts of time and damage output. change some of their mechanics and ease off of the heavy microtans focus; and i think you could get backing for expansion.",3
GOD DAMN AMAZING 1000000000/10,5
gay,5
"Good game, totally f2p friendly and fun gameplay and modes...only problem is that the file size keeps getting bigger and bigger...its up to 4GB now, pretty soon I wont be able to play as it will eat up my storage ;_;",4
I can't stop.. playing.. it's so good!,5
great fun so far,5
"It has Jeanne d'arc as a character, that's all the reason I need to play.",5
meh,4
"A great game, loving how it plays so far",5
"Beautiful and amazing game. I was skeptical going into this because of Nintendo's greedy and messy FE:Heroes, but I wish I'd jumped in sooner. The game is so much fun, the characters are wonderful, the art is beautiful, the co-op is a blast- and I hate co-op. I want to buy the slightly over priced but not necessary to game play microtransactions just to support the devs- who obviously put a lot of love into this game. I can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of JRPGs. Also, Daoko's music 👍",5
"Another Great Games from Cygames, great teams create great games, their Granblue Fantasy is my most favorite games of all times. Hope they create part 2, this game is just as great.",5
love it,5
I find Dragalia Lost to be a very fun game with a intreging story and I really like the characters.,4
"there are many games of this type, but this game does it right",5
nice game,5
"Great game. Definitely easy to lose track of time playing this, because there are lots of things to do.",5
seems like a cool game,4
gg,5
Love the game though rates of the gacha pulls could be better,5
"Really cute, fun and addicting.",5
"Really great fun and an interesting story, though it can take a bit of time to get into and to fully understand how best to build your teams.",4
fun game easy to understand and play,5
best and most generous gacha game that i played. Thanks to Nintendo and Cygames :),5
"One month in and I'm still loving it. The developers are very generous with free summons even after the initial burst that games typically do to get you hooked. There have been a few QoL updates done with last patch such as increased speed for auto, treasure trading from the build menu among others. If you're on the fence because of other gatcha style games have burned you, try this one. I'm glad I did.",5
"The game is great. I dropped my other mobile games because I just got sucked into this one and wanted to focus my time on this game only. Cygames is generous and they listen to feedback. I love that you can make any character work, regardless if it's a 3* or 5* Adventurer. There are maps that can be easy to start with all the way to the endgame content which requires work. Overall great game.",5

Very interesting design,5
It's a nice game. I like the comic strips.,5
Great port & very unique game play.,5
good,5
"Fun Game, Enjoyable :)",5
"i played this game on another one of my divices but then somthing happened to that divice and when i got this, this app was the first thing i downloaded. i swear, this is the best battel,RP game ive ever played. i reccomend to everybody that likes battle and stuff. the gameplay is OUTSTANDING! :D THE GRAPHICS ARE OUSTANDING TOO!! :D",5
"I have played many mobile games and usually I would uninstall them after a few hours to close to a month of playing but this game for some reason, I have continued since its release date (well, missed 2 weeks of its release but close enough) and it's very easy to get into and a lot of fun. You dont even need to spend money to get ahead in the game because it's not a p2w mobile game, nothing competitive about it, very casual friendly, (nothing wrong with that) and the devs are very responsive.",5
It good update: it still good,5
"I love it, the gameplay, graphics, and spawn are all consistent and are easy to aquire. I adore the character design and a lot of thought seems to been have put into personality of the dragons as well as the characters. in other words, it's a great game!",5
pretty good,5
lovely voice acters and art style!,5
extremely fun up to the moment. very easy to pick up and learn as well. load times are only drawback,5
Love it. Simple. Fun. Easy to use interface. Great story line. Keep up the good work.,5
its amazing unlike anything I've ever played before,5
"Good devs fun game, what more can you ask for",5
"unable to recover old account, doesn't recognize Google accounts as recoverable",1
Cool game!,5
Fun and exciting game. A very unique experience on mobile game.,5
love the story and game play,5
"Most people here that are giving out 1 star ratings are being silly. having issues with downloads? batch download at the title screen. if you lag or keep crashing, it's most likely your phone. summon rates suck? true. you are not guaranteed anything though. spend money at your own discretion and save up your currency. this game is very generous with its rewards. I've played dissidia,exvius,brave frontier, fe heroes, and dokkan. none of them are as generous over a constant basis like this game.",5
Adventure makes me hard,5
great fun,5
A revolutionary Gacha Game! Very free to play friendly!,5
it was ok but didn't get past the tutorial cause the game crashed,1
Cute game with fun characters and an amazing soundtrack. they keep adding QoL improvements! gameplay is pretty smooth,5
I love this game all the characters are all cute and awesome,5
This is probably the best hero collector type game there is.,5
"the missions are so much fun, I hope there is alot of them",5
i really love how the game plays and how u can pick a dragon for each person,5
fun game but crashes often for me,4
fun,4
story is fun and end game is slow but still great,5
cool,5
DANGER: GREEDY DEVELOPERS. I am officially changing my review from 5 stars to 1. They will take your money and say SCREW YOU when there's an issue with the Diamantium. They took my money and will not help me or return my 1500 Diamantium! AVOID THIS GAME AND ITS MONEY HUNGRY DEVELOPERS!!!,1
the customer support is very good,5
food,5
so much fun giving me some trash hero at the beginning that also looks like it and if you want to reset this piece of trash you have to reinstall the whole thing and download 4gb again,1
"Game has Nintendo polish, will update review when I get further into it.",5
"beautiful and has a surprisingly engaging story line, the biggest problem is the size. my phone is moto Z play only a year old and i had to delete other apps thst i used on a daily basis, to play it. And then after two updates it made my phone useless until i uninstalled it. frustrating, i liked it a lot",3
so far it's a nice game having fun with some friends,5
great!,5
way too much happening on menu screen,4
"The art is lovely and the music is awesome, making this game a really enjoyable experience. I like that you can toggle the voices between Japanese and English depending on your preference. I've been relatively lucky with my pulls so far, but I do think it would be great if there was a system to guarantee getting the featured character after x number of pulls like some other gacha games! Either way I hope to still be playing even in a years time and more :)",5
amazing,5
"Notte's Slumber Shot is a high-intensity cute-'em-up game! You play as a super-cool fairy fighting ferocious fiends. It's easy to get the hang of moving, but soon becomes a what-the-what bullet heck! With vibrant colours, a great soundtrack, and inventive enemy patterns, you'll adore this action shooter! And there's also a neat minigame where you play as Notte's friend, who's the prince of some kingdom.",5
i love it. played it every day since launch. developers are super great to the players.,5
love it,5
"Very cute game, easy controls, amd a captivating story. If your a fan of old school jRPGs I definitely recommend!",5
I've played it and it is so annoying I don't even know why I wasted all that precious time to get this game.I wasted so long time and when I finally did the tutorial I had to wait 1 hour! and then it said no more space trashy graphics and game play too -_-,1
great happy game,5
"Nice and fun rpg, ideal for quick goes .",5
"was fun during tutorial, but took entire night to download initial took all night, then wouldn't download the rest after, and proceed to not even open",2
great graphics,5
Great game loved since launch date and is continuing to impress,5
A high-quality app with beautiful graphics. It's can be difficult to control sometimes. It would be nice to have different music every now and then.,4
Awsomerer(cause my grammer sucks),5
it's a pretty fun game with a lot of well though out systems. The regular freezes are a pretty big problem though.,2
Wow I'm impressed and surprised on Notte's Slumber Shot event!! Kuudo to developers and please keep this game fun! *Thumbs Up*,5
awesome experience. good fun.,5
Good,3
"Re-enable split screen mode. It used to both work, and be perfectly usable. Removing it means I can no longer play videos in a split screen which also means I won't be bothered playing as often.",1
its a fun game get now imean right now do it yesss press the button i know you want to lol,5
I like the chibi style and the gameplay is okay,4
Pretty fun,5
Fun!,5
amazing! really fun!,5
A unique action RPG experience. If you like games like Diablo or Torchlight and the Gotcha mechanics of Fire Emblem Heroes you'll love this game.,5
"Great experience, although it lags in the menus a lot.",5
great game,5
I really like the game I find it very fun but ever since the last update the game take forever to load and I can't even connect to the servers it's been happening since the six month anniversary happened so pls fix need to get my daily stuff,5
great,5
"really enjoyable game, great graphics too.",5
"Honestly refreshing. Great, transparent and generous dev team. Rates could be better for adventurers and wyrmprints use to be the reason for it feeling so low but the changes to wyrmprints have made the game feel much better. Overall quality game if you enjoy old school grindy rpgs.",5
fun and addicting,4
"The gacha in this game is incredibly casual. 4* summons (out of 5*) are MAINSTAYS in endgame content, not just welfare filler. Even having one rare 5* character is enough to keep you entertained for months since you can do different builds for different content and plenty of gameplay tricks to learn.  Also, there's no PVP, so if you love that common 3* character? Go for it! There are enough welcoming, friendly players in co-op mode that are perfectly happy to run with you as long as you have the proper builds.  Graphics are fantastic. Community is great. Gacha is fun instead of frustrating. Cygames has done a great job with responding to feedback and there are constant QoL improvements. Really, best mobile game I've ever played.",5
"Best game since Kirby's Adventure. The gameplay is simple, graphics are outstanding, and the difficulty curve is slow enough to be able to adjust, but fast enough so that boredom isn't a recurring problem. My only problem is the summon rates, but I'm not going to rate this game any less than 5 stars just because of my rotten luck.",5
i regret not playing this game earlier,5
Great,5
so fun,5
this isnt really a review but i think u guys should drop a anime series i believe it would do really good the story line is already amazing.,5
good,5
good game,5
Fun,5
Jesus Christ this game take up 3 GB or more.,2
Best game ever. Generous developer who engages the community actively.,5
"Really, really enjoying this so far! Simplistic, yet challenging enough to keep me engaged and having fun.",5
It's a good game Nintendo knows what's up,5
amazing game,5
good,5
good game!,5
"Great game, FTP friendly with well spaced events. Really enjoying the way cygames handles the gacha and events!",5
Great Fun,5
"Best mobile title ever! well almost, the cost for premium is a little expensive. Still nice with just the free premium .",3
"For a gatcha game, so far im loving it. It uses mad amount of battery and space, but its understandable. Wish Nintendo made one for the Switch",5
"best mobile game I ever played, hand's down.",5
so far this is a pretty solid game.,4
"amazing game, really generous",5
"Solid game. A couple of things that keep this from being a five star game: the touch controls and the fact that I have to download story segments. Not that the touch controls dont work, its just I know this game will play betyer with a traditional controller. I also feel like my thumb (which I use to control Euden) gets in the way of the action on screen at times.",4
good game,5
its amazing just simply bliss when u play this game so perfect I love it.,5
it was okay i downloaded 800mb after having the app as additional data i said its fine then i finished the tutorial amd i had to download an additional 1.2gb on top of that how annoying. i uninstalled the game. very poor,1
fair share of gems for all players. love the storyline!,5
2 thumbs up!,5
"Updates are making performance worse. It has nothing to do with my phone or hardware. This game runs poorly. The ui is cluttered and every tap takes 1-4 seconds to process and load, which is very frustrating. Fixed assets are blurry at all settings. There are framerate drops, stuttering on all settings even in the menus. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive. Combat is repetitive. The soundtrack is bad.",1
nice game love the graphics,5
6 Months in still love it I'm not thekind of gamer to spend more than 3 weeks on a game. So when I say this game is still good after 6 months it's putting it lightly The people at Cygames and Nintendo have come together to bring us a game that keeps you wanting to come back. The game is 50% free to play and they give you so many items day after day to add 40% FTP. The other 10% is just you wanting to get a really small edge in the game or just to get a character you really like Play it! Now :),5
Keep up the great work,5
"Quite a fun game to get into and very addictive to play. I like the gameplay and the auto battle is quite handy and really good that you can interrupt it anytime by playing manually. Nice building when you get a castle and upgrading them is easy. The music is definitely addicitive and I always enjoy it. Overall it is a great game to play, I highly recommend it.",5
got my fave thats all that matters,5
excellent,4
it downloads too much. it's a amazing game everything about the story is good but it takes too much storage few days ago it wanted to download 1 Gigabyte eventhough I went to settings the day before and downloaded everything.,4
amazing have,5
Fantastic game. Entirely f2p with a pretty good endgame.,5
it is fun,5
"This game is incredibly fun and addicting. The events and raids are so fun to do, and there's so many of them! The art is amazing, and the characters are all so fun. There is a grinding element to the game, but it gives me a lot to do. Cygames is an incredibly great company as well, and you can tell how hard they've worked on this game. Dragalia Lost deserves way more than a 4.2 rating!",5
great game im loving it so far,5
I love this game.,5
"A great, fun, free game",5
"Updated review since game launch. The game has done major fixes and has started to make headway in creating something special. This game does not require you to be P2W! The variety of characters, Dragons and combinations of support equips has put this game above all other games in the app store. ive played a lot of popular games Khux/Fate/Dokkan/GandS. and so on... this game is easy to get into and easy to progress. This is the Best Game. Do yourself a favor and get lost in Dragalia Lost.",5
"Great game, great devs. Truly amongst the best gacha games ever made.",5
i'd enjoy it but have to uninstall because it takes up waaay too much space,1
They had me when they said there was Dragons,5
"This game has given me so much joy. The action is fun, the planning and strategy is engaging, and the stories are heartwarming and funny. I enjoy spending money in this game to support the developers.",5
great communication from the Dev. very generous,5
Great game,5
"This is the mobile game I've always wanted. It's an action game instead of the turn based games I'm so used to. Yeah the gacha is a thing but theyre so generous it doesnt bother me (except that one time I spent everything to no avail). If youre the kind of person who absolutely must have the top star units, then you should probably skip or lower your expectations. But the non-5 stars are still fun and useful and ive been doing fine as F2P. I left (day-one-player) FEH for this game. No regrets.",5
very lenient gacha as far as cygames generousity woth resources,5
Amazing,5
A really good RPG game made from nintendo,5
"I like this game a lot! Keep up the great work, devs; thanks for being so generous to your players!",5
"Very fun and cute game. Love the animations aswell as music. The Dub is good too, you dont see that alot with anime. Worth the time to put into.",5
"Fantastic gacha game backed by a fantastic developer. Just don't forget that this is indeed a gacha game; rates will not be in the favor of free players, but very much 100%able f2p. Be smart about saving your summon currencies.",5
"Seems fun, requires enormous downloads quite frequently",3
"Amazing game, great support from the devs. Highly recommend.",5
"Absolutely better than most summon games ive played, with the grindings and plenty of multi summons ive been able to get most of the 5 star units and dragons. All it takes is putting in effort to get the most of the game.",5
Phenomenal game. Great for F2P users as they are always giving out in game currency through events and promotions. always have something going on for power players and casuals. Prices are a bit high but can be rewarding. Great response to community and always making updates and QoL changes. Keep up the fantastic work,5
"I L O V E this game. Very F2P friendly, tons of giveaways, events, and developers that listen to feedback. You absolutely do not need the rarest of the rare units to do 99% of anything in the game. The game is very demanding and takes up a decent chunk of space, so I wouldn't recommend it on older phones but it has nothing to do with how the game actually runs and everything to do with older hardware. I never leave reviews, but this game and the developers deserve love.",5
"Quite fun, though I wish there was an option to use a physical controller for this. Touchscreen controls aren't as precise as I'd like. (Not this game's fault -- it's like that in general.) Cygames is known to be pretty generous with freebies, though their games are grindy. I can see a lot of similarities with GBF in how this game is handled.",4
Best mobile game I've found. Deleted the others after this.,5
auswa,5
"Awesome game! The game play isn't crazy hard so anyone can enjoy. While the gacha rates can seem terrible, you can get by on almost anything with lower rarity units. Some parts do need some patience and grinding, but I think the main appeal is the story elements. Each character has a little story that shows off each individual personality. And every month has an event or 2 that adds more content. Try it out!",5
"very good devs , very generous and a very fun polished game.",5
"great game, great developer!!!! love this game!",5
Amazing responsiveness from the developers,5
"Been playing since release day and it's my favorite mobile game! Fun gameplay, engaging story and beautiful art. Developers are very considerate of user feedback and are always improving the quality of the game",5
I LOOOOOVE IT ITS AMAZING!!!,5
Fantastic game. Developers actually listen to the playerbase and are extremely generous. A refreshing experience after playing other gachas.,5
Great game with incredibly generous developers.,5
"Barebones gameplay because all the focus went into the microtransactions. You have to pass through 4 popups just to reach the main menu: 1. update 2. daily gift 3. bonus 4. news then there are more menus before youve picked a mission, a team (dont forget the reminders to pay for 5 star teams) more download popups and finally a few seconds of basic gameplay.",1
I love how generous they are and the characters are super cute! <3,5
"This game is so much fun! I would say the gatcha rates are pretty standard, but even if they are low, the more common characters are all really awesome. They share almost the same amount of detail as the more rare crowd, and some are even better written and more endearing. It's very easy to enjoy this game to the fullest without spending a dime, or even just as a casual player. The events are n00b-friendly, and so is the community (for the most part, haha). Lastly, the gameplay is really fun!",5
"Absolutely amazing gacha game with plenty of beginning, mid, and endgame content for players. The devs are incredibly generous, and the community is wonderful. 10/10 best mobile game I've ever played.",5
good family christian value fun.,5
"Totally charming action-rpg. I'm surprised how well the touch screen controls work. The multiplayer community is friendly even when levels go badly. It's a gacha game, but the action rpg gameplay means even if you are unlucky pulling units you can make up for it with skill or practice.",5
Incredibly fun and in-depth for a mobile game. EASY to play for free since the developer is very generous with free currency. What's not to love?,5
Very polished action game. Great multiplayer co-op. Runs smoothly with quality of life features being frequently addressed by capable developers. Feedback and help also work like a charm! Thanks!,5
Very fun hack n slash game with surprising depth. Excellent developers. Very attentive to feedback it's pretty amazing actually.,5
Nice,5
"Firstly I must state that most of the low reviews on this game are due to old or budget phones not being able to run this game properly. This game is big and demanding for a reason, it's quality. I have been playing this game almost daily since launch and it still had not lost its charm. To fully enjoy this game you must set goals and work towards them, there is so much to do and comes at you quick with all the content updates. I had the game at 5 stars on release and I still affirm that rating.",5
"Legit the best mobile game I've played. The characters are super enjoyable, and the gameplay is challrnging and fun. All og the units are good in the right situation with a little investment and i look forward to all the cool events and new stories that get added to the game. Would definitly, recommend to anyone. The devs are also super generous and reaponsive to recognizing and fixing,problems as they occur.",5
Fun with dragons and good storyline. But don't like that all the female characters are in love with the main character. Why not other males?,5
I alwase have a hard time finding a fun game to play that keeps me interested with both a story and entertaining gameplay. This game gave me both and fun and unique characters to obtain along the way.,5
"For a gacha styled game, its extremely gracious with gifts and freebies. You never feel starved for currency. Been playing for 6 months and still enjoy it.",5
Amazing,5
Great free to play game...save your wyrmite!,5
Excellent little ARPG.,5
Intersting thus far.,4
"Easy to pick up and play. Simple controls. Good details. I just started, but so far so good!",5
I am a daily player and give the overall game a 5 star rating. The most recent patch has caused Imperial Onslaught graphic issues and when I attempt to access the mission(s) the game outright hangs and will freeze the game client. The graphic issue is that all IO missions display as a white box. While I havent tried Advanced Dragon Trials the display issue appears there as well. Running Android version 6.0 on a LG G4.,5
pay to win,1
good,5
"Simplistic control and decent paced combat. Is a ton of fun for a mobile game. I do have a small quarrel with the frequency of the downloads, if I wasn't on unlimited data, I would have burned through all of it by now.",4
"Over all, the game is fun and is something you should definitely play if you have the time. I personally have put many hours into it, and have had a great time. The game isn't perfect though. It takes gigabytes of space, and that doesn't include the downloads after you launch it. if you have the time (and storage), I definitely recommend that you pick it up.",4
我沒想到這麽好玩,5
"Such a beautiful game, the artwork is awesome <3",5
nice,5
"amazing rpg that doesn't just play for you. effectively making it a clicker game, but this makes you move and doge to up your chance of winning",5
This game is very good but i have one problem with it . it's the space . And the only way to solve it I think is by the SD card space,5
Great game!,5
mo,4
"The game is basically everything Fire emblem heroes wish it was, every character has its own storyline so we can actually get attached to them, rather than just present through gacha. I quit fire emblem as soon as this released in Canada, absolutely no regret. Goodbye cheap 2D boardgame-like gameplay, hello 3D dungeons!",4
nice game love to see a tv series,5
I'm just tryna ball with my bros,5
way to much of downloading and update,1
good gameplay bad gacha,3
this game is really fun i wish you can still play with out wi-fi tha will be cool,5
Great game play. Generous game publisher on game currency.,5
"I've played other gatcha games before but the quality of this game is incredible! Everything from graphics, game play, voice acting & music is top notch. Devs respond to issues and are quite generous. Side comics for the story are weekly. I love this game!",5
"good fun so far but server connection issues all the time unrelated to device or internet service, its probably due to the popularity of it but still needs fixed. edit : 5stars, take my money Nintendo i love it",5
Best mobile game I've ever played. I've been hooked for six months straight.,5
Exceptional,5
"The main game mostly boils down to mashing one's thumb on the screen with the odd swipe. Simple, but enjoyably so. Between that is lots of story and dialog but that can be skipped. Constantly seems to require little extras to be downloaded, despite having hit download all at the start. Not the end of the world but makes offline play hard. All the rest might be interesting to some but seemed far too finicky to me and generally detracted from the main event.",2
"highly addictive, simple and satisfying. one finger controls make it highly playable. Smooth graphics and engaging story",5
"Addictive gatcha that kills plenty of time. Playable without spending cash. But for crying out loud, go easy on the pop ups, and dialogue boxes, and screen transitions, and Loading... Loading... Loading... You'll spend 4x as much time navigating the UI and multitude of screens than you will running maps (which I suspect is intentional on the devs part) :/",3
great game!,5
fun game.,5
great game haven't faced any problems yet. Good Job!!,5
Notte is best girl,5
"Best game on mobile. Developers are very generous with currencies, you don't need to spend a dime to enjoy this game.",5
ok good very nice,4
This update is no good for my phone. A lot of lag with this update. I can't play this game anymore and I don't want a new phone. :(,2
Nice game but levelling up is pretty slow,4
The updates make the game more and more laggy. Till the point that I cannot even play co-op,4
only lvl 12 and I'm enjoying it. cute characters and an engaging storyline. also dragon mode op,5
great music,5
"2 issues: 1) 3/27 update is 1.5 gb. For a mobile title with mediocre graphics. NOPE. Uninstalled. 2) Only way to get a guaranteed 5* character summon is to spend $32 to buy 1500 Diamantium. I get that this is a freemium game, but $32 for 1 character is ludicrous.",1
great game,5
easy rolls,5
Good game with a ton of things to do and fun adventures with a story that is simple to follow along with multiple challenges and events that always leave a loud impact.,5
"Holy cow this game is amazing! This is the only RPG I've played that has a really deep story, funny and cute characters, and good gameplay. One suggestion I have is maybe a crossover character in the form of Link from The Legend Of Zelda. (Preferrably the Link from Skyward Sword or Twilight Princess. Either one would be nice to see.) It would be cool to see him reimagined in an artstyle like Dragalia's.",5
Really fun game,5
it's now my favorite mobile game,5
Alot to take in but graphically very nice and really good to get into only just started but had friends helping me current event helps with early starters too :) defo worth a try,5
good,5
is k,5
pretty good,5
"Great update, dev accept and listen to all feeds back. Great game worth a try. Most only F2P friendly",5
great game very fun,5
Amazing so far i like the plot and let's see as i go,5
I need a luca alt pls,5
game will eat your wallet,5
I really like dragons,5
This game quickly became the main mobile game I play. Truly an expertly designed mobile adventure rpg.,4
i wish there was a console game of this type,5
good game,5
great game,5
I love the artsyle and especially the music. Overall solid game,5
"Great graphics and fun to play ! Im enjoying very much . After GBA and NDS 3D ,this is one of my most favorites game by far 👍",5
"Great game, lots of things to do, quick loading times... only problem I have is, when you're in quest mode, you want to upgrade real quick, it doesn't take you back to the quest screen, gotta go all round the houses, other than that... cracking!",5
great gacha game that is very generous,5
"The gameplay and story are amazing, although it takes up a lot of storage.",4
good game yo,5

"great. crafting system needs work. not finished. ridiculous clicking ""grind"" to finish a maxed out weapon",4
"Fun game with cool characters, an interesting story, and engaging game play.",5
"the best game I ever play, love it so much",5
great game. easily a time sink.,5
"One of the best, cute, well-written, exciting, unique and fun games ever to play. Would really recommend to everyone to try because the stories of the characters and the world they live in will capture your heart with such satisfaction. offers endless hours of enjoyment and such a unique pleasant experience to play. Thank you so much for this beautiful and amazing game.",5
crashes at timed but rarely,4
"Amazing game. The music is truly beautiful and each character feels distinct with unique traits and usages, giving them each their own persona that I enjoy.",5
addictive and amazing,5
great game. just the controls could be better. it's a bit hard for me to use. I think either adding in a joystick or maybe making it moga compatible would be a good touch. i know not many have a moga but those who do could enjoy this game with ease,4
best mobile game so far,5
very fun and balanced game with cool rng,5
"amazing game! Unlike many gacha games, this gives you as much of a chance as anyone else, not the whole ""you pay, you get better ones"" stuff others do! And, as a Nintendo game, the characters and gameplay are amazing, along with the storyline!",5
something that I enjoy playing,5
Nice,5
"No option to skip audio or cutscene downloads. The game is fine, but doesn't allow the user to store downloads on external storage. It's simply too much space dedicated to voice acting and presentation which feels wasted on a mobile platform. As of now the game demands 3.5gb of internal storage, and that's simply too much for the experience it offers.",2
"Surprisingly fun! Nintendo did good with this one, and the art style is definitely great!",5
"I wish it had better controls. like, these controls kinda suck when playing on a tablet. but I love this game so much. and I really hope it gets some kind of sequel or something on the switch!",5
It's a really great game😄,5
expensive only if u pull. 0.5% rate on pickup and 5*,5
cool game,5
Pretty good game thats for free but it can be limiting. its a mobile game for a reason.,4

well done,5
its a fun and exciting game.,4
"Great game, very addictive",5
awesome game addiction to the max,5
I love the presentation of the game. Everything is so bright and full of energy with an amazing soundtrack. There's super fun gameplay and the controls / UI have really improved with updates. I also love the story and character interactions. The log in bonuses have been very generous and events / updates have been keeping the game feeling fresh. This is my current favorite mobile game and I definitely recommend it!,5
I love it has has been amazing for 6 months.,5
"The micro transactions are just too much. It's be nice if they made an action version of Breath of Fire, which this game reminds me of. But it's not much of a game without dumping tons of money into it.",2
"Gameplay wise its absolutely brilliant and a joy to play. The huge amounts of downloads at every given moment and having to sift between bad rates for the units, dragons and wyrmprints during the gacha makes the game a bit less enjoyable to play. ☹😵😱",3
i really love this game hopfully sponser this gamer lol !,5
I choose to play this over console some nights if that's any inclination as to how awesome the game is.,5
a little too easy of a start,4
Can't log in. Keep saying Connection.,4
fun and easy to pick up while on break. the music is also really reat,4
I like how the game flows. Something simple and easy to control.,5
"game good, gacha bad",4
So. Damn. Good.,5
Some of the dragons look like girls,5
"This game is good, very good. The only problem i have is that it lags a little. Could you fix this?",4
"great game where devs actually listen to their players, and they're usually very quick to fix bugs or contact you if you need help.",5
"800mb DL to start then 1.2gb DL 5mins later, then constant DLing for each and every story. seems like a useless thing really, no point if I'm downloading longer than I am playing.",1
"love the style and gameplay. very f2p friendly, and the story isnt halfbad either! definitely worth checking into!!",5
awesome game (enough said),5
"Dragalia Lost has become very easily top #1 app on my list. The campaign story, the co-op raids and the continued work from the dev team to constantly make quality of life improvements has made me fall in love with the team and the game. Thank you!",5
"This game is both incredibly fun and shockingly generous. It is slick, charming, has good writing and has a good mix of allowing you to play it for a long session, but not requiring it. It does require quite a space commitment, and would likely be more fun as a console game. Sort of like an MMO Phantom Hourglass.",5
Amazing game :),5
"this game is ok, and the story gets interesting and interesting as you progress",5
not much fun,1
Good game,4
Words cannot describe the generosity of the devs and how they respond to feedback of players. This game is top notch and I truly appreciate all they do!!,5
"It's great, with cute art, interesting play style, alpng with an intriguing story. The gacha can be a bit overwhelming, but it is definitely addicting, to say the least.",5
"Phenomenal. plenty of generosity from the devs, their active in the wonderful community and the gameplay is extremely addictive, with some of the best soundtracks I've experienced in a mobile game. All of this and its free to play and easy to get in!",5
nice,4
"What impressed me the most is how active the makers of this game is and how much they listen to the players. Wonderful gatcha game, decent story, great game play, great characters, and I'm looking forward to game events.",5
So far one of the best games on mobile,5
Finally a game to keep me entertained.,5
"i love this game. theyre generous, the art is good, the story is engaging, definitely a top gacha game.",5
yay,5
awesome,5
Good.,5
"This game is fun, but the end game is grind heavy. If you do not enjoy that type of thing, this game is probably not for you. There seems to be an event about twice a month, and the developers are constantly updating the game, and they listen to the community.",5
It's got Lily from GBF 10/10,5
Fun and extremely fair and generous for a gacha game. Very enjoyable.,5
Excelente juego. Como siempre de buena calidad por parte de Nintendo.,5
Great game!,5
Happy Birthday Donkay,5
"more fun than most gacha games, generous too",5
Cool,5
awesome game!!,5
fantastic gameplay and characters.,5
great fun.,4
Woo,5
"Might be a good game, but requires huge downloads that need focus, that often lock, and the current one can't even finish, so the game is currently unplayable. Still unable to download the in-app update despite multiple attempts and following online advice (none given from the actual dev). Lowering score in accordance with that.",1
it's fun good story. I'd give five stars but the initial two downloads were insane and all the small downloads is kind of excessive.,4
a good new IP from Nintendo. i hope they bring it to the switch.,5
I love the story line to the hole game. even the story's of all the characters,5
Love the game really good graphics and simple game play well done,5
"fun, fast, with a beautiful world",5
"Great game, terrible support.",3
really almost 3gb of data and only not even an hour into the game and my last review was deleted not playing ever,1
A good time sink if you're ever bored. Pursuing the game casually is equally valid as playing it more seriously.,5
I losve this game so much. I started playing it when it first came out and all i have to say is yhat it is an amazing game.,5
"Pretty fun for an app you don't need to buy anything to enjoy this game. Daily grind is fine and not too taxing and story isn't too bad just has too many anime cliches but not enough to ruin my experience. I took a star down because I noticed that this game has some bully players mostly from the eastern community, it is not fun when players get into elitism for raids I have beaten and was ready for and simply won't try or will choose weak units and go in the raid waste your feathers and quit.",4
cute and fun!,3
"Pretty fun game soon, a bit of a battery vampire- but that's to be expected.",4
gg,5
easy to control,5
fantastic game!!,5
love it,5
great game,5
Fun game to pick up and play when you have a few minutes to spare,5
It's nice to finally be able to play the game! I'm really enjoying it!,5
One of the best mobile games I've played.,5
"Love it, wish there'll be an anime of this",5
ABSOLUTELY INCRDIBLE,5
nice.,5
this game is amazing definitely a good game to play on the go.✊🏾,5
Best Nintendo game on mobile phone,5
Gacha took my soul but it's fine I guess,5
Amazing game that is lots of fun and looks/sounds amazing.,3
I just hate the fact you have to download data everytime you start the game. Otherwise its a good game.,3
Good game....but too much loading walls,4
"It's super fun, enough said",5
good job Nintendo!,5
The amount of Wyrmite (gacha currency) given is incredibly generous early on and shows the amount of care towards the consumers. The graphics are astonishing for the free pricetag along with a captivating story with fascinating characters.,5
great,5
fun so far,5
luv,5
"This is a wonderful game. its similar to KHx and FFBEx, so if you liked those youll really enjoy Dragalia Lost.",4
berry gut,5
Great and pleasant game. Good looking and nice gameplay,5
It's amazing and cute at the same time ❤️,5
great game but if you didn't start when it came out then you're WORLDS behind,5
Very high quality.,5
ITS SO AMAZINGGG,5
"This game certainly has that Nintendo polish and quality. Also, the soundtrack with DAOKO is phenomenal and is my favorite part of the game. This is the first mobile game I have rated five stars. Amazing job, devs!",5
New favorite mobile game! Great story and really fun gameplay!,5
fun,5
"A legendary Quest! this game has amazing gameplay, that's smooth and fast, great online coop! everyone is included in raids. and the OST is perfectly catchy.",5
"Beautiful and vibrant. F2P friendly and plot-focused. My only gripe is that you separate WYRMPRINTS from summoning and have a different system for it (please, im begging 😭😭). Otherwise keep up the great work 💗",4
surprisingly good game with low pressure on forcing you to pay,5
Why do I have to constantly downloading stuff. The game is good but why the so many downloads,3
it pretty good,5
Truly an amazing game!,5
"A fun little rpg, made me think of some older games I once played",5
"With higher production values than the average mobile game, a simple to grasp and easily usable control scheme that comes close to giving you the level of control console gamers have come to expect, and a fair business model that avoids falling into the trap of ""pay to win"", Nintendo proves once again that they are capable of bringing glimpes of their beloved gaming experiences to mobile platforms with grace.",5
"Just, Perfect.",5
all around great game...also ad free...so yeah,5
Awesome game on mobile just needs a tiny bit more customisation,5
fun game i like,5
"I think this game is a masterpiece, controls are simple and fun, rewards are bountiful but not shoved in your face, difficulty is at a great level, but what sets this game apart is every character is interesting and has their own backstory even the dragons do, and the story is absolutely great I have found myself getting immersed in it and not skipping anything since they aren't exhaustingly long",5
Constant connection errors.,1
"great game, the music really reminds me of an old anime called Chobits it's very good. I'm worried to get too invested incase it doesn't last tho.",5
very amazing game great story line awesome controls just a good all around game,5
"One of the better gatcha games I've played. Good production value, only mild knock against it is the constant downloads for every quest and story event. But it's fairly fast download each time, like a second or two before the quest loads. So not bad at all.",5
Nice games,5
"Great game, but could be better. Not a fan of microtransactions and constantly having to download new chapter segments, but they don't seem overly bothersome yet. Gameplay is fairly straightforward, with many customization options for your party and an easy to use interface.",4
stopped working after update. uninstalled,1
Great game with an excellent developer who listens to their player base and are quick to implement fixes and quality of life updates.,5
"Fun game, frequent events, challenging content once you beat the story, all of which can be cleared by free characters. Best of all is great communication from devs, quick turnaround from feedback and frequent updates on what's in store for the future of the game. Been playing since olOctober 2018, wanted to put a review here after seeing people complaining about the game without really trying it.",5
"Decent overall, do feel inclined for in game purchases to progress to 'endgame' areas which is partially a minus. Smooth gameplay, action comat implemeted surprisingly well for a mobile game.",4
too much download not enough playing time cant purchased anything,1
Wut the heck... I downloaded and install then to get a msg im not authorized to use the app.?!?!,1
"This is the most fun I've had with a mobile game in years, simply a must try. Gacha is somewhat fair as well? A lot of customisable options too. My favourite things are actually the adorable artstyle and how the characters bounce in sync to the music, not to mention the amazing variety of upbeat soundtracks! Would have liked if they added an option to change the language in voice acting though I'm not complaining since the English voice acting in this game save for certain characters is amazing",5
brilliant. nicely polished game,5
"I'm not a fan of the ""invisible joystick,"" but it's still fun.",4
very well made on every aspect.,5
nice,5
"its amazing game ever, a lot of bonus, balance rate for getting new hero, and a lot of things to do.",5
good graphics and enough points to get a starter party to last for free,5
awesome awesome awesome good game lots of downloading but worth it give it a shot,5
I HAVE COMPLETELY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH DRAGALIA LOST THANK YOU SO MUCH NINTENDO AND COMPANY BY FAR MY FAVORITE GAME,5
Just started. Having fun. My secondary mobile.,3
JESUS CHRIST!!! please create this for the Switch too!!,5
Fun little game with plenty of ways to earn mats and a bit of premium currency. however this is a re skin of a game called rune atory by colopl. That game is gone now but this ia the exact same except they went full on gacha and popped in a stamina system. Rune Story you could play as much as you wanted. also the amount of stamina is pathetic. At lvl 50 you have 50. it basically equates to 3 runs.,3
"Very fun and interactive, treats players well, rates are well... it's a gacha but you never walk away with nothing. very good overall",4
"It started off fun, but quickly became repetitive. Also rates are bad even compared to general standards of gatcha games. I've rerolled about $20000 worth of gems and didn't get the one hero I was looking for.",1
Mym cute,5
Music is great for weebs but the camera and movement feels so werid.,3
Good game,5
Awesome little slider rpg really recommend,5
everything is going very well.,4
"i have been waiting for this game for a long time, and i am happy to say i am not disappointed. the graphics and gameplay are everything i imagined them to be.",5
please allow playets to reroll,5
its fun,5
fun,5
"Game is nice enough, even generous with currency...but it's idea of ""Dragon"" is a mess. Of all the 4* or better ""Dragons"" I've drawn, only one has been an actual Dragon. The rest were a goth lolita with bat wings, a Phoenix, and a unicorn ripped straight from your daughter's Lisa Frank stuff. The real dragon was obsessed with Beauty. Avoid if you thought the game would be full of interesting Dragon units. as it stands, if my next 4* or better Dragon isn't a Dragon, I'm gone.",3
"Fun but big. I pre-registered for this game, and enjoyed it, but it takes so much memory up that with almost every update, I had to delete other apps I felt'ld be important later; there also doesn't seem to be a way to dismiss unwanted adventurers, which bites because I have LOTS of adventurers that I never use and'ld LOVE to dismiss, particulally a certain fire archer because of something in his story I REALLY didn't like. fix those problems, and I might reinstall it. Hope this review helped.",3
"good, wish it were a premium game without the free to play stank to it but, yeah it's pretty fun",5
Good combat and gameplay for a gotcha game,4
Absolutely amazing game with a suoerb story and amazing graphics. Such a captivating game i am personally only a few chapters in. No pressure on in game purchasing and a unique story presentation. Many tens if not hundreds of hours of playability.,5
pretty cool game like it.,5
starting off strong. can potentially be a great long lasting game.,5
"Like Fire Emblem Heroes, this game does require a lot of data download after downloading the app. In fact, to download everything you need you'll need to do it in 3 sets of around 1GB each, though there are settings to reduce it. The game itself has a surprisingly fun soundtrack and the gameplay itself is fun. I find moving feels a bit unusual but it just needs some getting used to. The gacha currency seems plentiful and free to play should be very viable, a fun game overall.",5
"Hey developers thank you so much for this amazing game, i have some ideas can make the game more enjoyable and 100% perfect     1 - add chat text, why? when i'm playing i need a community to chat with ,i need friends in the game that make a competition to keep playing      2 - give other players an option to see my castle and me too, will be great to see that in the game     3 - when i want to join with other people and anyone click ready game get little crashing, please fix that  that all what i hope the game have and once again thank you for a great work",5
"Pretty nice game great colors, graphics, and voice actors are nice too. Good job cant wait yo get more into the story.",5
"fun rpg, seems Nintendo worthy so far. Still early in, hope the game keeps up being this enrertaining :)",5
awesome,5
Ok first off i started playing the game when it first came out and boy it was amazing. I still play to this day. Im really glad this game came out and i cant wait to see how the story ends thank you for such a wonderful amazing game.,5
love it great job guys. is fun I can play for hours.,5
lovin ut so much,5
"good so far. very fun. the kind of quality you would expect from nintendo. actually got the sugestion from a top gacha games of 2018, so yeah!",5
love it,5
خوبه,5
fine,4
Ive only played once. I LOVE THE DARN GAME!!!!!!!!!,5
"This game is a fun time killer. simple gameplay, the characters that you can unlock all have interesting designs. overall I'd say this is a good mobile game.",4
pretty fun so far i love the work put into the game!!,5
i love it,5
So far it's fun to play,5
"A great RPG good story, good graphics and for a mobile game the voice acting is actually really good 😁",5
cool game,5
GG,5
download from store only forces another 800 mb download with nothing to do but wait. Not that interested in sitting and waiting.,2
"This game has great graphics, music and gameplay for a gacha! However, I can't help but be a little annoyed at the long downloads it forces on you after downloading the app. I feel these should take place the moment you click install, rather than happening after the fact and forcing you to keep the app open on your screen for half an hour.",4
So far so good.,3
It's pretty good.,4
"The game finally comes out and it doesn't work. Won't even load. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing changed. I had to wait 7 months for it to come to my country. Very disappointing",1
"this game is incredible, graphics, gameplay and story.",5
a surprisingly good action RPG. ny only critism so far is the touch controls - I don't enjoy them.,4
The game is very well done. Energy system is a tad limiting but the game is solid.,4
good game so far. though lots of additional downloads every level or so. be sure to be near wifi.,4
"Fun, simple ARPG.",4
best game,5
can't download the game data in the background ( almost 2 gigs ),1
fun and i love dragons,5
good game but I wish it was landscape when fighting an it need pvp,5
Fun and enjoyable.,5
"great and fun game! the controls are a bit hard to get use too. like when you attack, you need to be facing towards your target rather then just pressing on the mob itself to target it. Graphics are good! I like the art when you see the characters you gain. the music and story telling is amazing. feels like I'm watching a anime.",4
"long downloads, bad writing, and super basic combat",2
lovin it so far,5
Good story and characters :),5
awesome,5
"i tried deleting the app, but the icon wouldn't disappear even when it was deleted. when i clicked on the icon, it said the app was not found, yet i couldn't remove the app icon.",1
op,5
great game goood graphics and play,5
"This is a very addictive game. I kinda wished it was for the nintendo switch instead however, bcs then it would add more games to the switch and be playable on a big screen, unless you have a tab that can play it. but graphics are nice, gameplay feels a bit smooth. However, there are consistent downloads to it. if they could find a way to have it all downloaded in an update patch so that way we could just click and get it over with that would be splendid.",4
haven't gotten to use it yet. it wants me to download the update. it also wants me to rate it now??? ok its an app. works well enough to go to its Google play page to update. so i guess it would get a two.,2
Amazing,5
"Cute and beautiful visuals combined with a simple swipe/slide/tap mechanic makes for a solid gameplay experience. Plus a decent enough story to keep you invested is always a plus in my book for any mobile game. My only gripe with the game is that, while manually playing, it can be slightly annoying to reposition your controlling character towards an enemy during combat, especially after a dodge was used. Besides that however, a solid mobile game nonetheless.",5
easily playable and fun game without forced and annoying micro transactions!,5
game seems fun but massive and repeated large downloads. If you have the space go for it but I don't have time or space for these large download sizes,2
fun game,5
"Fun for a while, but sooner than later it feels like homework. It forces you to repeat a handul of stages non stop and getting duplicate 5stars feels absolutely horrible.",3
"I absolutely love this game. Absolutely wonderful gameplay. Great story, both in the campaign, events, characters, and the dragons. Mechanics are on point for a free mobile game, and has great progression. The soundtrack is the best I've heard in a mobile game, period. I'm really excited to see the road ahead!",4
"Absolutely my favorite mobile game ever. Enjoyable story, fun game play, cool characters, and amazing customization. ALSO SUPER DEEP RPG TOOLS! I <3 u Nintendo and Cygames!",5
It was fun!,5
Great game,5
fun game. a little dialog heavy but absolutely work y a play through,5
fun game. not much difficulty but its more about collecting. no pressure to buy extras either,5
amazing!,5
this game is awesome!!!!! it's like pokemon go except you don't have to walk around getting hurt.,5
"Pretty good voice acting, decent controls, fun gameplay and its not always pushing in-app purchases in your face. Worth a play.",5
"i really like the game but i hate the only way to link an account is with a Nintendo account , so i tryed making one to link my account and got access denied on the account i made literally moments before, and method i try links the account so add more than one way to link the account",2
"Fun gameplay, nice character designs, and a fair gacha system for what it is. This game has a lot of depth from my initial observation. Lots of character progression in the way of weapons, skill unlocks, and accessories, in addition to dragons and companions. My only issue is the story can kind of get in the way. If you enjoy a story along with your grinding you will definitely like this game.",4
"i keep cant.log in, please fix it then.i.will give 5 star ...if not how to.play",1
Fun game with lots to do but its just way too big for my device compared to everything else I play not to mention how much it lags at times,3
"Played it at launch and quit within 10 hours. At the time, I had been absconded by Fire Emblem Heroes and I wasn't impressed by the idea of playing two separate gacha games. Came back after awhile and noticed not only a jump in quality, but a much better experience overall. It caught my attention tenfold and I've loved it since You can tell the dev. team really enjoys what they do with this game and have put forth a lot of effort to make it: engaging, fun, flashy, and enjoyable.",5
its definitely entertaining,5
nice graphics. Fun story mode and good game play.,5
"loving it, mechanics and graphics.... Nintendo don't disappoint",5
"Best game of this kind, amazing attention to detail and plenty of quality content.",5
I freaking like this game the heroes are freaking nice their voice is great and they kinda move with the beat of the music. the only negative point that my charger doesnt charge fast enough for my phone battery s usage while playing this,5
nice,5
"Great game, love everything about it",5
"its actually pretty fun good, good plot, and easy controls. really good graphics for a phone amd alot of characters.",4
it's a good game controls are a little different but fun game none the less.,4
GIVE US ALL WHAT WE WANT.... ZELDA ZELDA ZELDA... HURRY UP WITH ZELDA,4
"yeah, it's pretty fun.",5
great,5
"would love to play this game, I was waiting so long for it BUT NOTHING INSTALLS TO THE SD CARD ANYMORE if you can make it so that you can choose to intstall to the SD card, I'll reconsider playing again. my phone doesn't have the space for your main game download....",2
"love the music, audio and cute japanese 3d model. rating base on initial play.",5
"the game is great, and im all for rich story telling, but this game's dialogue is exhaustingly drawn out and LONG, and sometimes repetitive and unnecessarily detailed. i feel that in an attempt to add emotion to a casual game, they ended up making walls of text saying the same thing in 5 different ways. otherwise the game is great, but jeez, im usually tempted to skip halfway through story quests",4
"i loved this game, loved the artwork, loved the characters, and the story. however, i still uninstalled the game. The draw rate for pulls is horrible and when i spend time getting the jewelites together to do a 10x pull and everything are duplicates, it is disheartening. i dont spend $$ on the game, i just use what i find in game. if the draw raters were better i would come back...",4
Gud game,5
"Great game...but lag...like WAY to much lag! I try soing a quest, and half way in the middle of it, it lags, and suddenly crashes. This is on the lowest setting i can do to make this game less lagger than it is, and its annoying! Though, the story and events are cool.",3
Fun game. Great music.,5
great game,5
It is amazing,5
"Hey, I enjoy your game and stuff but I been noticing the graphic on game sometime disappear and it been bothering lately. Even though, I reset my phone a couple of time now and it work but then it will disappear.",4
"Decent game that looks and plays amazing,i just think the voice acting is really bad and the story is quite bad as well, i got bored rather quick, not the game for me",3
"Not user friendly, menus are too busy. Extremely unoriginal story line. Uninterresting caracters. Not the quality I'm typically expecting from Nintendo.",2
"Gameplay is great, they keep churning out banners almost every week, but the summoning system is utter garbage. Banner 4 stars advertised have a lower rate than the others, it will take up to 6 multi summons to get the 4 star featured unit at the very least. Wyrmprints exist which are similar to CEs in fgo and Artifacts in Epic Seven, thay have double the rate of an adventurer or dragon and will almost always be your 'pity breaker' to reset the escalating odds. Avoid the game.",1
It good,5
"So far a great game, it's taking time away from my others already!",5
so 👍!,5
Amazing,3
"Initially very nice, it's Granblue x3 - but that's also the problem. There's just an amazing amount of busywork and the main plot runs out super fast. Plus, the combat wants you to pull off fast maneuvers that are completely unsuited for touchscreen, so that gets quite frustrating. But super addictive main theme song.",3
like a Nintendo game,5
"its amazing and so much fun, you get a lot for the low low price of 0.00",5
cool game,5
so far really fun,5
Loving the game so far. Great job Nintendo!,5
"Gorgeous and fun with a very engaging story. But, the AI is garbage, not great in a team based game.. can't always do coop. Some levels they literally just stand there half the time -_- loving collecting stuff though, really enjoyable game.",4
amazing game Nintendo you never fail to impress me 🤩🤩,5
great game,5
"Great game, really love it, great controls, sounds and graphics. would rate it 5* buy after the recent update I can't play it. It stops and crashes on the loading screen. Please fix it asap!!!! Will rate 5* after fixed.",2
Too much downloading.,2
a fun rpg game but it does lag and slow down a bit,4
Great.,5
Awesome game!,5
It won't load after the newest data update,1
"great story, cant wait for more. a bit repetitive and lame that it has stamina especially with the gotcha loot boxes, but they update regularly.",4
it's actually a really fun game! as expected from Nintendo,5
So far this has been probably the best mobile game i have played yet. I recommend it for everyone!,5
great!!,5
the publisher has actually fixed all my major gripes with this game,5
"So far loving everything about this game. Between the cinematic cutscenes, beautiful art style in characters and various levels, very smooth gameplay, easy combat and navigation sytem and interesting story this game really checks out and cant wait to see what new ideas and updates have in store.",5
great game controls are good story is fun...what's not to love,5
Best Game Ever,5
"A well polished game, as expexted from nintendo. Removing a star because it released many months late to Canada.",4
its fluid fun and a good story,5
"Touch controls take some getting used to, but overall runs relatively well. Just be ready for a small download every time you do a new stage, it may use a lot of data if you are not connected to wifi",5
gg,3
Sweet game lots of fun,5
It's cool Play this a couple of weeks and it's amazing,5
The combat's so easy that the early game is more about sitting through loading screens than playing a game.,1
its a lot of fun,5
Has been fun so far!,5
Yeet,5
amazing game!,4
"Love it so far...the music, animations, story...its a gem",5
this is good! very nice anime style graphics and very ftp friendly,5
"Game is way better than it should be. That fell when a Nintendo mobile game has better servers than mmos. It's depressing, but this game is so good.",5
chill game~,4
"great graphic, music, voice and even story line, nicely done!",5
I'M A LEGENDARY MASTER GAMER. ONE OF THE BEST RPG GAMES I PLAYED IN A LONG TIME...EVERYTHING IS GREAT IN THIS GAME....AND IT'S A CHALLENGING GAME. IT'S A 5 STAR GAME,5
"better than I thought itd be,",5
"really wasn't expecting much, but I'll be damned if this game isn't pretty! need to progress a little further, but I'm digging it so far.",5
highly addictive and very generous f2p game. The Nintendo seal of quality is strong here.,5
"This game is incredible, I love the gameplay and music. Even the cutscenes are super well made not like other games I have played, I usually skip cutscenes but in this game the story is fantastic so skipping is a no go for me. I hope you guys keep up this amazing work.",5
"Really good, especially for a free game",5
Very cute and easy to get into. Good amount of customization and fun gameplay. No in app ads and it took two months for me to run out of stamina and that was after the long story content. Would definitely recommend.,5
it's a lot of fun so far,4
"Amazing game, love it so far <3",5
Please controller support pleas I cry,3
"Amazing graphics, story and it has that Nintendo feel you love when they get it right. Best mobile they have made yet imo other than Pokemon Go. Mario Run or whatever was getting there but this game is worth heavy data. I suggest going to settings and downloading it all at once. Have fun!",5
"game keeps Crashing on the 3rd Map Boss Battle, tried clearing Cache etc but after dozens of attempts I'm Uninstalling!",1
"To be a phone game, it has a good story, graphics and controls, I can also say the should make a sequel for the Nintendo Switch with same controls",5
your game is soooooo cool,5
interesting game so far,5
"Like this game a lot. The music is awesome and the control feels good. If you experience some graphics glitch, try turn the menu screen from 3D to 2D.",4
Dragons... what more can you ask for,5
i like it very much. especially the music,5
crashy,1
fun,5
still having fun,5
there is so much to it and you should install this,5
Can't even play. Installed it after a friend recommended it only to be met with cannot connect to server. I have no trouble accessing anything else but this game.,4
"p2w, they give a lot of gifts such as 10× summon vouchers and 1500-3000 wyrmrite at times, BUT the RATES are horrible, atrocious, and the return of Eldwater for duplicate characters is disgusting. Watch your wallet. and may RNG be on your side. I love you Cygames but man.",1
"Fun action RPG that respects your time, and doesn't force you to spend money to advance.",5
"I mean, it's a Nintendo game...",5
"In half an hour of time spent in the game, there was about two minutes of gameplay. The rest of the time was watching large downloads that can't be done in the background and story sequences.",2
fun little game for wasting time :),5
It's aight,4
"Well made, feels like a real jrpg without the tedium. Albeit a large app, the designers were very smart about space.",5
good,5
don't 5,5
thar be dragon's,4
I wasn't too sure about the game at first but when you spend a few minutes on it you get sucked into the story and the game play is fantastic.,5
one night in dragalia makes a hard man crumble,5
good game,5
enjoyable yet stamina runs out too quickly,5
best JRPG game on mobile,5
AAAH! EEEYA EYA EYA EYA~! 5/5 ✨ Music,5
solid game. love it,5
"pretty fun, only just started but surprised at the gameplay",4
"This game has been a lot of fun so far, doesnt make you feel like you're stuck behind a paywall, which is nice. definitely worth a look!",5
this game is great if it was 3d gameplay it would be better like blockbuster,5
This game is cool. You get to fight dragons and monsters with a party of heroes and the story makes me want to find out what is happening next.,5
Love the game but now I am stuck due to every time I open the castle grounds (which I am forced to do through the tutorial) the game force closes. An y help with this would be amazing!,1
It's a fun addictive game,4
"Fun Action Rpg. nice addition to my mobile games collection. The combat can be a little stiff at times with reduced movement when attacking as the traction doesnt always pick up what you are aiming to do however, the game is engaging and the story while not deep does have the classic Rpg Troupes and feel. Recommended",5
"Lovely game, good music, good mechanics.",5
love this game can't wait to see what you all come up with for this game next,5
Incredible game. Well worth the wait for a release in Canada.,5
its purdy,5
"Great game! After figuring out how to download in batches, it was a breeze. The graphics are great and so is the story. The voiced characters are a nice touch. I really like how it seems to be a full game and not just a pay your way through ordeal.",5
great fun,5
fun game. great BGM. just started but the stories compelling enough tp keep me playing.,5
Really getting to Enjoy the game and the Graphics on it.,5
it's really fun and this gives ALOT OF STORY to characters it's not a regular mobile game you just play while being super bored this is a actual game. this game does have a lot of downloading tho..,4
Warning this game is roughly 3GB large but Dragalia Lost is a great fantastic Action-RGP game. The game offers unique gameplay experience and delivers a fascinating storyline with memorable characters. The most appealing feature has to be its artistic presentation and well created menu. I highly recommend this game for anyone who has spare space on your phone.,5
pretty good so far. let's see if it continues,4
honestly better than i hoped,4
pretty fun,5
limitsq,5
"Lots of loot collecting, little real gameplay.  The levels, when you eventually get to play one, are too simple. I didn't get any sense of strategy, just tap until things die. Like Diablo if you eliminated almost all the skills and set it to some super-easy kid mode.  Lots of the standard stuff to get you hooked (daily rewards and challenges, etc), but you need some fun gameplay or it's not a game, just a chore of collecting shine stones.  Also, very inefficient file sizes. You have to download around 2 GB of data AFTER the main download. For reference, that's bigger than the entire game of Final Fantasy 7, which was a MASSIVE game.  The plus side: cute graphics, better story than most mobile loot grinders.",2
Another smash hit from nintendo.,5
Good,5
Awsome!!!,5
"Great little game with loads of character! I'm not normally into the chibi 3d style but here it's presented beautifully, and more importantly it plays very well. I'm looking forward to playing much more of it!",5
Would earn 5 stars except for the unrelenting downloading. Unplayable unless on Wifi. This is a mobile game right??? Beware: it chews through data.,3
Shockingly impressed. The quality of the gameplay and story greatly exceeds any other game that is free to play. There are so many games as a service that fail in epic proportions compared to this game. Simply astounding.,5
very fun game . very f2p . Lots of fun too .,5
Fun and generous game. A quality Cygames game with great character designs and huge cast of voice actors. Gameplay is fast paced and easy to learn.,5
Best gacha game out there!,5
love it,5
I'm so happy that I can finally play this game. I'm having a blast and the art is so cute!,5
it aight,4
"4/5 stars. Great first impression, but haven't delved deep enough to give it 5/5 yet.",4
noice,4
plays just like a full console game,5
Amazing. i wasnt edpecting much after playibg so many disappointments but this. amazing.,5
"downloaded the game today, upon installing asked for 800mb file. downloaded. after the opening story, it asked for another 1gb of file??i have no issues with the size, it ruins the experience for me (i don't know about the others.) as the time i could have been playing the game is instead wasted on downloading files. i wish all files would have been downloaded upon istallation. It was FUN! but the multiple downloads RUINED it atleast for me. Great job on the game though!",3
"I love it, excellent stories from each adventurer and in general, game play is fun, overall, a solid game",5
this game is actually pretty good. I wasn't expecting it to be this cool.👍👍👍👌🤟😁,5
Fun but needs a lot of space,4
"phone doesn't have enough space to store all of the data this game requires, and since Nintendo has pretty much given a giant middle finger to emulators, I won't be playing this until emulation us possible again",1
Really cute game and it's pretty fun! I'm not far into it yet but the story seems interesting so far and the characters are quite cute. There's lots to do in the game too! I just find the directional controls frustrating because you tap to attack and having to drag to move makes the controls overlap and it seems to confuse the system sometimes on which action to take. That's my only main gripe with it.,5
Good graphics and story line for a free game. Game mechanics are easy to learn.,5
a bit complex but good nonetheless,4
nice game,5
Pretty dope game with good voice acting surprisingly.,5
very good game,5
Another masterpiece from Nintendo. Love it.,5
great,5
Every character is a silhouette which really reduces the playability why is it on the Playstore for this phone if it looks like that,1
"It's great and it's free with totally optional micros that you can get through just playing. A lot of effort went into every aspect; gameplay, writing, voice acting, the whole lot. It feels like a 3DS type game for mobile.",5
"great gotcha game, not idle very active",5
great game! Controls are silky smooth and just about bamg on perfect. great graphics story seems good so far. another great nintendo game,5
"I'm having a good time with this game! My only complaint is the way you move your character is a bit wonky. I feel like it would be better if your character moved to where you touch the screen instead of the ""virtual joystick"" movement that's in it now.",4
This is a AWESOME game its very interesting and so far tge story is interesting,5
"dumb a$$ game almost 3gb of data used and then when you want to start a adventure you have to keep downloading further data whats the point in both data downloads of like 1 or 2 gigabites if youbhave to keep using more memory to play the adventures.... im really dissapointed uninstalled what could of been a good game... another thing I realized too it over heats you tablet/phone/i pad devices :( inreally wanted to play this butnto much time downloading data is not what i expect to play games ),=",1
such a big app!!!,3
Decent gatcha that doesn't shove the shop in your face.,5
fun,5
"Super awesome game! Graphics are nice and clean. Constant new events and new things to play, characters to obtain, stories to read and items to discover. Just wanted to thank the devs and Nintendo for this awesome game!",5
so far so good,5
so much potential but sooooooooooo much downloading.... bit much personally,1
The game feels very fluid and plays very well even with its control scheme. It's fun too.,4
its good,5
Great in general. Easy to pick up. Just that rather data consuming. Have to download every stage(?). Wouldn't that takes up my phone storage eventually? For 1 game?,5
gucci,5
"Fun for a bit, but it's gotten boring quickly. Controls are awkward, my finger is always gliding off screen when trying to move although that's the fault of my phone screen size rather than the game.",2
amazing game,5
idk if this game is good since I can't even reach the starting screen because of a user authentication error.,1
this game was bad i thoght it was for kids ☹️ this is the worst game👿 but it looks fun 🙄,1
fun game so far. i hope they kinda go this route with zelda mobile,4
"This game is so hard, I can't even get past the title screen. The song is just too good to listen to",5
Great game really addictive much content like a lot,5
woah,5
u8,1
i like it,4
"Very fun, nice graphics, good soundtrack. Satisfying to play, not pay to win",5
bug bug bug all around,2
"Enjoying it so far, for what it is. It's a well produced gacha from Nintendo. It'll be fine for a while, but eventually I imagine it'll be the same as every other mobile game that's designed to target your wallet.",4
"As usual , very high quality release from Nintendo ! Excellent game ..",5
Super fun RPG with a good story!,5
fun,5
2 hours in so far so good,4
"So far.. it's another typical gacha game. They do offer a few 10+1 pulls as you play and collect the free currencies but in the end, your rates are pretty bad. Besides my first single draw which was a 5☆, I have done over 15 10+1 draws and only walked away with a few 4☆ characters and couple 4☆ dragon/wyrmprints. In the end over 90% of all my pulls were practically useless. There is no competition yet, but at this point in game I'm seriously under powered, no hope to catch up. I quit, gacha fail",2
excellent,5
I played game since it first came out.i put a lot if money in it and time.my smart phone broke.i had to get a new smartphone but my account was lost.i remembered linking it through my Google account but it's not working.all my maxed out characters and gone.when I tried to talk to customer support they blow me off and refused to help me.never buy anything from this company again. they won't help you if you lose your account and data.they will only say sorry for your lost.dont play this game,1
The game has satisfying and simple combat combined with cute character designs.,5
Nice and cute game. Game size is big and might lag once a while.,4
fun,5
short but enjoyable game,5
I am enjoying this game very much! please add a character rating system,4
magnificent,5
So far so good!,5
My high hopes and anticipation are in the bin. I have two 5*... how am a getting dupes of them three times? AT least let me keep and use my dupes... feeling ripped off at this point. I use to trust you Nintendo... feel like your setting my childhood on fire :<,2
wooooot,5
cant put it down!,5
polished and fun!,4
"So far I am enjoying this more laid back mobile game, that doesn't really on PVP to drain wallets. Though it has its way. My biggest complaint is that it's a Nintendo mobile game, which ofc means emulators are death penalty crimes. I don't appreciate having to drain my battery every time I want to play. FFS Nintendo get over your emulator hate-boner! Also Nintendo makes rerolling one of the most obnoxious/horrible/soul-violating experiences in all of mobile gaming.",4
"A very gorgeous game! Only fact that I give a 4 stars of 5 is the hero control, it can be messy at times. Nonetheless, 9/10!",5
"is good, i like, ye",5
Gg,5
pre goos,4
"great visuals and game mechanics, but the controls are so poor. really needs improvement.",3
"super fun, cool, and unique game",5
the game is fun and enticing. i love how the gacha stay true to the rate up and doesnt require a fortune to obtain a good unit.,5
The game doesn't disappoint at all. 10/10 would recommend to other people.,5
"It's a lot of fun. Controls take a bit to get used to though since attacking is based on the direction you're facing, and not where you tap.",5
The game itself is good but it keeps on closing every so often also the speed in which you can do things is a bit slow as well returning to the main menu to procede onto the next quest seems a bit pointless but overall the game is fun and enjoyable,3
Fun,5
"Pretty good, it has that Nintendo polish but it's also a pretty typical for a mobile game nothing too special. Give it a go it's worth it",5
so far a great and really fun RPG and it's not too hard to earn summons without paying for micro transactions worth a play,5
It is a GREAT game. The game controls are easy to use and the story interesting.,5
"Whenever I open the game, it keeps saying that the game does not work on my hardware, but i've been playing for a long time",4
fantastic fun,5
extremely good,5
good,5
"i like the art style, music and story, but the clunky menus, clunky dialogue, incessant loading and odd combat take me out of it slightly",3
gd,4
"Dragon ... in an RPG, HELL YEAH.",5
great,5
Awesome :D,5
No real complaints so far,5
"Not sure about this one, graphics and storyline seem OK but there was a lot of additional downloading that couldn't be done in the background so ate my battery.",3
seems pretty cool like the idea of being able to play as everyone in the party it be alot cooler if the let you pick what you main guy was in terms of class selection but you can chose not to use him at all wich is also pretty sweet,5
it's pretty awesome for a phone game,5
Great game!,5
"Fun jrpg like game. runs smooth, kewl story so far keep it up Nintendo & Cygames",5
1star as my device isnt compatible -nvidia shield tablet k1,1
Good,5
smooth graphics good rates for gatcha and good voice acting,5
error code 400? what ever that is?,1
"Amazing Job Nintendo, Really great game with an awesome story. Was sure worth the wait for it to be released in Canada.",5
Too much contents to download,2
Love the game so far,5
awesome game but very large. feels like an entire pc game on handheld. great,5
best ever,5
"It had some trouble installing (kept resetting my phone) which was frustrating, but im glad i kept trying. Despite the installation this definitely has the high quality expected of nintendo licensed games. The controls are simple and accessible, the graphics are charming and the SOUND is phenomenal. As for the in-app purchases; i haven't been made to feel like i must pay them.",5
Look fun but the rates are horrid. Much worse than stated. 3 x10 rolls not even one five star hero.. Another epic 7 type game with horrid rates,2
say bad connection wen im full wifi bars an wnt let me play sigh......,1
"Horrible rates for a gacha game with an absurb micro transactions scheme... Good gameplay with decent graphics & some catchy tunes. I hope the best for this product but honestly think its bound to fail the investors on the middle to longterm plans. Just an opinion, thank you for reading. ~Siimon",2
simply awesome,5
it has been awesome so far.,5
Finally is out for Austrslia. So far im enjoying it but the gacha rates seem low and wyrm prints are soul crushing to get.,3
Daoko is love,4
fantastic rpg game so far.,5
fantastic game with an excellent developer that supports the community.,5
really like it so far. and so far don't need to pay to play,5
fun game,5
Looks amazing. The storyline is greatly written. Having fun! I want more cool Dragons!,5
"The game has large downloads which cannot occur in the background while using another app, or with the screen shot off. This is a terrible start to a game.",2
fun story and voice acting (japanese). great gameplay and not stingy on gems from quests. But IAP is quite steep,5
Cute and fluent game,5
makes me go uwu,5
good,5
"It's a lot of fun. In game currency is given out at a fair rate, and summons are at what feels like a perfect cost.",5
"fun game so far, story driven",5
"So far I'm loving the game, a few small issues with the menu design and other small nitpick things. I think I'll keep this game for a while.",4
A game made by Nintendo and Cygames is a dream come true,5
"Beautiful well made game, enjoying the total experience.",5
"More simplistic than RPGs that I usually like, but it is actuality quite good!",4
good game,5
when I finished downloading the full game after already downloading it from the appstore I couldn't even play because the texture would not complete,3
far to many large downloads needed to play. didnt have the space to play. cant rate the game fairly as i could play it.,3
the game is really fun so far. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF DOWNLOADS ! STOP MAKING US DOWNLOAD EACH MISSIONS ! make us download the whole game at the beginning pls. or at least at the half mark make ua download what is left.,3
ya good game,5
If Nintendo made Summoners War,5
it's pretty good.,5
so far so good,4
A sugary GBF oh yiss,5
Love it,5
"Its a fun gacha game with very nice graphics but has some of the most confusing battle mechanics I ve ever seen. Apparantly you can switch to the perspective of any of your party members and play as them. Since dodging is a large part of their battle mechanics I tried to keep switching to keep skills off cooldown and dodge Major attacks. However, when you switch, your other characters just go back to AUTO rendering whatever movement you ve done pointless. Another gripe I have is that they limit your entry to stages by your teams power or might. Although they know the minimal power needed to clear a stage better than I do, I would like the chance to know what type of power Im working towards. Aside from that there s quite a bit of work needed to make all the skill related stuff more evident or perhaps provide a tutorial. Overall, its kinda a combination between FE heroes, BF and FFBE.",4
"well the game crashes and freezes a lot so it's not the most stable game out there. the game play is ok utilizing tap to attack, swipe to dodge, and hold to move. outside of that it is just another stamina based gotcha game designed to try and take your money. the 3d is nice and designs interesting but summoning sucks and feels bad with the game lumping so much of it together. the game is also stupid large and asks you to download a lot all the time to make it even worse.",2
honestly not bad so far. I like the controls,4
Its a really great game haven't play it to much yet but it's really fun with a great story. However it is really large and some lower end phones may struggle a little but nothing to big.,5
the one I've been looking for. I'm sinking all my time into this one. love it,5
awsome game!!! I recommend it to anyone who likes rpg!!,5
cute and fun.,5
"Character models are completely black for some reason, and the game crashes when I go to the Quests menu. Not at all worth the massive amount of space the game take up.",1
is ok.,3
"Pretty fun game, controls need some tuning like attacking where you tap instead of the direction you're facing and sometimes you won't move in the direction you are dragging the cursor in, but besides that it's been fun, the voiced cut scenes are rare in a mobile game and the graphics are top notch too",4
"this game is great, a bit easy though",5
good,5
"Brilliant game: sort-of manga style gameplay, and strategy rpg encased in it as well. Quite addictive; not a bad thing. Overall: absolutely fantastic.",5
gg,5
Great game so far!,5
Good,5
This game is so nice. I enjoy a lot.,5
fun animation and fighting style with an interesting storyline.,5
great and additive game to burn time and great dialogues. graphics are cool too. definitely worth the time to play!,5
Is alright,5
"Looks great, sounds great, decent story, just not a fan of the gameplay. Fantastic for anyone looking for a hack and slash gatcha game.",3
Amazing game so far!,5
great game.,5
I'm not too far in but the game and characters are super cute and the controls are easy to pick up! I literally can't put it down when im meant to be working! 😬,5
ok,5
"I like it, a lot actually! But... for some reason, the game doesn't start up properly. It's just a white screen when I start it up. I've uninstalled and re-downloaded it quite a bit. It's not working at all. It's a shame that it stopped working like this.",2
It is a great game and it has dragons so what's not to love,5
"Ez Pz Lemon Squeezy, never bored again !",5
Wat can I say ? Its Nintendo !,5
such a good gamr and addective story :O,5
Fun so far,5
great immersion,5
gr8 game m8,5
It is a breathtaking game to play I like it lots,5
"A great game, graphics are brilliant and gameplay is intuitive, responsive and easy. there's a lot of depth to the game mechanics but it's not overwhelming. the only downside is the amount of downloads you have to do",4
Great game no problem with any of it,5
nice and cute. its almost like breath of fire.,5
Good Graphics,3
"So far, so good. Well drawn and voiced, the interface is a little confusing. Has some pay to play elements, but I'm not sure yet how playable it is eithout spendinf IRL money.",4
"very fun and simple controls allow the game to be easily picked up by any type of gamer. i would suggest a high-end phone for a cool experience. i haven't anything bad to say, but i also haven't played the game thoroughly as of yet. Nintendo did good with this title! Hope to see everyone in-game!",4
fun great game,5
great,4
love playing dragalia lost,5
Cygames best gacha games company ever. The dedication and care for this product and it's community is the best. Games asthetic feels really Nintendo's family friendly also. Feel really safe to dedicated to this game for long time.,5
"This a pretty solid gatcha game with controls that take some getting used to. If you like a decent story, then you'll like this. Be warned, if you have an old phone or low memory, you may not have a great experience running this game. But don't give a bad review just because your phone doesn't have enough memory or because it came out in 2012 and can't run this game.",5
"love the story and love the gameplay, not a problem but I'm curious why you start as a 4 star instead of working your way up from 1 star? you get weaker companions but it just seemed a weird to me, not a problem just unusual, just finished chapter 7and can't wait for the rest of the story to be updated into it. is there a release date for it? ive played alot of mobile games and this is the best or one of the best I've played, it beats alot of console games and it's not pay to win butucan ifuwant",5
Fum game,5
Not overly impressed by this. 800MB to play 5 minutes then 1.41GB to play on after that.,2
bruuuuuuuuuuh,5
Great game,5
super slick!,5
"Boring game, a waste of time",1
Looked good but far to data hungry. each segment is a separate dowload and that was after two very large downloads just to get past the prologue.,1
"Good game, beware long download",5
I love this game it is so fuuuuuuuuun,5
good game,5
honestly love this game.... you have to do a 10mb download before every mission but it's a classy game made by professionals. truly am enjoying myself. WOULD recommend.,5
Fun and cute,5
freeze on tutorial. never hd a chabce to play,1
Guud,5
Too many downloads,1
Yh,5
"so far so good. controlled aren't very responsive but they work. nice graphics and animations. lots of story line if you like that kind of thing but has a cool ""summary"" if you want to skip it. lots of complex menus and upgrading, very confusing. downloads content at every fight scene which is annoying. EDIT: i found the download section where you can download all content. from the home screen > More > Options > System > under Batch Download click Download Settings",5
good controle and fun,5
so far so good,4
yasss slay,5
pretty fun game lots to download initially,5
"One of the best mobile game I've played. The poor reviews are ridiculous. Just batch download the data, stop complaining about your lousy outdated phone with insufficient storage. This game is very, VERY F2P friendly. Wyrmrites are being given out generously, provided you clear your daily endeavours. Although the AI is weak and dumb sometimes, Co op play during events and boss fights are certainly enjoyable. It's even more so when you have friends to play with.",5
Great and addictive game. The only thing a little annoying is the length of the storyline parts.,5
"VERY FUN, NOT A WASTE OF TIME!!!",5
da best,5
wyrmprints are the worst. 5 star rates are super low as it is and having a 5 star be a wyrmprint instead of a character or dragon is the worst when you need 5 of the same dragon to max them.,1
a good game but i have had skill animation and summoning animation just die on me several times and will have to close the game and restart it only for a short time later to have it die on me. the skill animation dying on me is not really a problem but the summoning animaton dying on me is the problem because it gets stuck and must restart the game and i have to serch fo what i got from the summoning,4
The story and gameplay is great so far. I just wish the quest's were a little longer.,4
"I can't even play the game. it's gives me a notice saying ""user authentication failed. game can't progress"" I got all this pointless hipe for a game that doesn't even work.",1
"What a fantastic game and a story that is worth playing through and listening to instead of skipping it. Excellent game play, different from ither games and I get to be a dragon, awesome jist wish I had better luck with summons... like evey other summon game.",5
Quite fun. nice character designs and seems fairly generous with currency.,4
good... had issues with helper had 2 select none to advance to start quest,4
"Really high production. Great art/music, good gameplay, and a generous system for f2p players.",5
its good. screw the other reviews,4
this is my absolute fav game ever but after the last update my chromebook wont run it at all it dosent even try. come on nintendo fix this i want to play dragalia lost but now your telling me i need to buy a new device to play? so not cool!!!!!,1
excellently designed,5
Bananas.,4
Fun to play.. Ez game and everything is fine,5
making me download an installer that then has to download a +1GB file is not cool. let me download in the background and don't lie about game size.,1
"So far a fun game, well made with good graphics",5
"This is a nice game. Developers and company, can you think of real-time PVP battles with ranking or something to spice things up so that people can stay and have purpose to climb further.",5
"Graphics are great and gameplay is easy, once you do the bulk download the playtime definitely picks up as well.",5
"extremely fun and cute , definitely worth your time",5
"Really nice graphics. Almost getting to 5 GBs. Campaign structure is unique. Well balanced and less frustrating to farm unlike most games I've played. Gets boring at some points then immediately hits you with something unexpected. Tip: in the title screen, be sure to do the batch download. Helps save time later.",5
good to play,5
concept is good but far too much data loading which making it slow and lagging . has potential to be really good game,4
Honestly I love the story Ive experienced so far but right now the game needs to be better optimized. It sometimes can be really slow to join a party or sometimes it doesn't at all and the game just freezes.,3
it is big but so far worth it,5
its pretty good,5
Does not download levels in the background but otherwise enjoyable so far.,4
Amazing,5
i really feel like this game breathes life to the character and the story. Tho i do think it should inprove on the castle grounds abit and maybe the combat abit but adding more combo by swiping in some configurations besides tapping and holding.,5
"The one game that not only captures my attention, but keeps me from getting bored. I love it.",5
Great game so far!,5
Qhy do we we need to download so much data in game and not in the playstore it wastes so much time. but other then that great game,4
really enjoyable so far!,5
fun,5
good game so far!,5
"Great game. Would like a pokemon game like this, with maybe an open world",5
The story is nice overall but having to keep downloading the chapters is a pain,5
wow.... love this game...,5
Overall brilliant game,5
Wow. Thank you Nintendo. 10/10 enough water and waifus,5
Good game.,5
One of the funnest games I've played for any platform. Fast and fun. It also has awesome music.,5
great game,5
"A nice simple jrpg experience. While it does add mobile systems (stamina, gacha heroes) the story helps make it a bit interesting and more compelling them most low effort mobile games",5
fun and very addictive...gatcha lovers unite,5
"Another great mobile game from Nintendo. Really enjoying the simplicity of the combat, the game looks good and plays well. My only concern is all the different layers to improve your characters, feels like there's too many .",4
"2.5 gigs for a mobile game is ridiculous, not to mention battery drain from so much story telling in between game play",1
fun game to play when bored,5
I think it is so anime&kawie,5
Really enjoying it! 🥰,5
"Looks good but it makes you download each level individually, very tedious. Each level is very short with lots of mandatory dialogue in between. Download 2mb, play for 2 minutes. Download 2mb, read for 1 minute.",2
Fun game play interesting back story,5
The music is great!,5
would be five star if the quests took more than a minute to complete. otherwise a great game,4
The featured dragon and hero rates are too low to the point you spend over 2000 wymdrites and still get nothing,3
"Amazing game, just started playing and enjoying every second",5
"Great game, great story fairly fluid control system. Store prices are expensive but definitely uneccesary anyway which is great. Overall a really good game, worth a try.",5
This game is soo good the graphics are amazing and nintendo knows how to polish games 😀👍,5
Wow this game is amazing! The graphics and UI are smooth and pleasant on the eyes. I love the battle system and the way you attack and the sound effects are really rewarding. Really looking forward to playing this game for a long time.,5
"Put this on the Switch! it's a really fun game, I feel as though it'd be more at home there, especially with the download sizes, thus the 4 stars and not 5.",4
"Who said mobile games are inherently bad? I did before playing this. It is a genuine action RPG that just happens to run on mobile and controls very well. Yes, it has gatcha elements, but how else is Nintendo going to get their money out of it?",4
I love your games so much and I will keep loving your games forever,5
"Great game, lots of fun.",5
amazing game! highly recommended!,5
Not bad so far.,3
I wish Valve would release Half-Life 3,5
Pretty fun gacha rpg game to play! Good work on this Nintendo!,5
Excellent,5
For a free mobile game the story and gameplay is really good. Micro Transactions are present but you can easly ignor them and they arent needed to enjoy :-),4
"it seems like a fun game, but the downloads after each section are ridiculous",3
"As expected from Cygames, from TCG, turn base RPG, and action RPG. Really nail all of it, the graphic, cute bgm, and original compare to any mobile I ever play in ios or any platform.",5
i really love it it has great story and easy to play,5
I like it,5
Just downloaded it and won't let me play goes to a white screen and shows I can't authenticate and the game can't proceed. I had no option to input my emails or Facebook etc. Just that I can't authenticate. unfortunate.,1
"It was just really fun, and the gameplay was pretty good.",4
"The story isnt the most engaging, but its fun nonetheless",4
"great game so far, very fun",5
Excellent game. Reminds me of Pokemon Rumble,5
beautiful game,5
pop,5
"Nintendo have done it again. Dragalia Lost is one of the finest Mobile games I have ever played, simple controlles but complex combat make for this to be a masterpiece of its own, not something u can often say about a mobile game, dont even get me started on the music, probably the best music of any mobile game, or just game in general. Art style is beautiful, almost reminds me of FF15 poker edition. Cant recommend enough. 1 request? Switch port maybe? Even then I'm happy playing on my phone.",5
sick game💯💯💯,5
Been waiting for this game! Surprisingly fun! The characters are cute and loving the music/ost!,5
good,5
Make aDragalia Lost 2,5
Great thats all,5
"Pretty good for a Mobile game, kinda like a diet diablo. I enjoy this on coffee breaks",5
pretty cool,4
"weird feel at first, a little different and hard to control but overall really fun.",5
YAAAAAAAIYAAAAAIYAIYAIYA I love this game so much. SWEET SASSY MOLASSY,5
"awesome game, very versatile gameplay and havent felt like stopping sibce I downloaded it. Hasn't felt repetitive and honestly the best free game of the genre that I played so far",5
lovely little game,5
"It's a highly polished and fun game for your mobile device. There's only one major complaint that I have with this game and that is that it only became available in my region (Canada) about a week ago. Because of that there are likely an influx of new players a year behind all the rest and it just seems like a daunting task to catch up and learn all of the games mechanics. Otherwise the few hours that I have played, so far, have been enjoyable.",4
"I've been playing this since September and it's finally available in my region! A fantastic game as long as you love colorful characters, and don't feel a need to collect every single one! They're generous with gems anyway so save up and roll during Gala Dragalia!",5
"Looks like it could be a good game, but you download the game and it's 80mb. Then you start it and you have to download another 800mb. Fine, whatever. Then 10 minutes into the game you have to download another 1.3GB. No thanks. Uninstalling.",2
"fantastic graphics, smooth transitions, great story and an easy to grasp battle mechanic. All in all a very enjoyable experience.",5
great game fam,5
so much downloading 🤪,3
One of the most fun and addicting mobile apps Ive played in a long time. Very FTP-friendly and generous pull rates for each banner. Definitely recommend trying it out.,5
Pretty Good so far,4
"fun game, runs great on pixel 3 xl",5
Quite addictive,5
"really don't get the hype around it. the whole game is about clicking ""next"" button between speech bubbles. once a fight starts it usually ends within a few seconds then it's all about just reading again. not mentioning that before the game even starts you have to download additionally almost 2 gigs, then before every story chapter you always have to download a few megabytes. later on the game you will start running out of stamina, but of course if you PAY than you can continue the game.",1
hells yeah this is good,5
Smooth experience,5
"Great game overall. Hands out lots of premium currency so very f2p friendly. controls are easy to learn, great tutorial, and lots of unique characters and enemies.",5
fun,5
"played a lot of it on the US servers, love this game, good little time waster and surprisingly addictive",4
"First impressions, pretty sweet game.",5
why do need to download more? I downloaded it was playing. then finished tutorial area. And said whelp download more? sure it looks fun. But can we get just one download please.,3
"It's a very diverse game full of characters and achievements to unlock. Smooth, swift, and satisfying gameplay make it to be a very enjoyable nintendo game... (especially when its themed around dragons).",5
I was enjoying the game until I finished the prologue and it wanted to download over a GB more to keep playing.,1
great graphic and storyline. really enjoy playing it.,5
best story and graphics ever played whoooo!!!,5
I really enjoy it,5
"I love this game so much and finally i proper game from Nintendo for phones and tablets and i think you all know what i mean by a ""proper"" game ^_^",5
"Fun game, great graphics. Reminds me of rune story that no longer runs.",5
Good,5
"I LOVE Dragons, so this game is a 10/10 for me! IT'S AMAZING!!! DRAGONS ARE GLORIOUS!",5
breath of fresh air in the ARPG genre it's simple and easy to play but it has its charms!,5
nice graphic and gameplay!,4
this game is awesome I love it alot...,5
This game is really fun and super cute!,5
Awesome,5
Goode,5
Super game,5
fun so far,5
awesome,5
the cool concept and the gameplay is pretty smooth,5
"best game ever , loved the art style",5
fun game,5
very good game,5
"Great production value, and gameplay depth.",5
Fun and beautiful. Well done dev's.,5
"Got to play this for a bit, seemed like a good game, stopped playing earlier today, now the game doesn't load anymore, push to load the game, screen goes black then white, and nothing happens afterwards",1
I love all the characters in this game and the boss raid battles are never disappointing. I always look forward to the next event.,5
wont load ive tried to a couple of times just says failed to connect to server,1
Before you can play you have to download an almost 900MB file. Distribution server was on the slow(few MB throughput) side although this is around launch I guess. That file is mainly for the the starting area that you clear in 10mins and you'll then need to download a 1.3GB file. With gameplay and story being lacklustre and a bunch of reviews saying the monetization gets pretty heavy-handed I called it quits there.,3
game is hella fun and ui feels polished (i mean for day one what can you expect),5
"Good game, fun, great movement and controls. My only problems are the obvious batch downloads and the character movement stuttering instead of smooth.",3
Great game so far. love the visuals and character designs. the game also is easy to pick up and runs smoothly.,5
fun game,5
This game is ridiculous. Every five seconds it makes you download another several GB of game data. Just put the whole thing in one download. No one wants to download every freaking section of the game separately.,2
Not too bad of a game!,5
Great responsive game,5
Glad i waited for the uk release,5
Good and easy to play,5
5 stars! Not even close to a 4! Even though you have to download each part.. Its what is expected of Nintendo!,5
great game to much downloading so uninstalling,1
This game is AWESOME!!,5
"Premium, how many mobile games do you know that are better than some real games?",5
"Good game so far, will edit review after further gameplay.",4
"Game play seems fine. I just can't stand all the required downloads for cut scenes. I don't want the them. Once downloaded, you can skip them, but you still have to download. I'd like to explore this game further, but it drives me mad.",1
"mixed bag, the game plays well once downloaded, but good grief how big is it!!! i made it to the third area and each level requires another download. By this point its already touching 3gb in size!! it maybe my phone, but it seems multi touch is a bit dodge, having to let go of movement to attack.",3
way too much to download,2
Really Fun :),5
Cant even load it,1
Amazing game,5
偶 被,5
Great game but needs way more storage than they initially tell you (an extra 2 gigabytes in 10 minutes of gameplay),4
good game but there needs to be an option to download the game data in the background so you can continue to use your device,4
Its good,5
"Great RPG, feels like a Square Enix game",5
"The draglia lost is a fun game so far, but am really only at the start of the game. But I do wish there a way I can choose do all my download before hand using wifi. I do wish there was more voice over.",4
fantastic,5
Fun,5
"Finally, a game that is actually good. Developers, Nintendo, well done! Simple gameplay yet addicting and an immersive storyline.",5
"have good mobility and the the game mode was very good, y like tje game",5
boring game,2
Took me a while to reroll and all but i got a good start. Rates are garbage but thats for every Gacha game. Otherwise the gameplay is cool.,4
its been great so far!,4
Great story progression,5
"Great game, very well polished. Fun little action rpg with typical hero collecting, but somehow doesnt feel as bad as most",5
Shows promise for a chinese gatcha game published by nintendo,5
Great game no real pay wall's for me so far,4
Having fun playing,5
The character designs are amazing like Hawk and the gameplay is smooth and fun.,5
great,5
"Its not a good game for mobile. Clunky controls for a touch screen game. Terrible roll mechanics, infuriating combat mechanics. Why doesnt my character automatically turn to where Im tapping when attacking? These controls would work much better with a controller, its currently absolutely abyssmal with touch screen controls. The shop is a mess. Each currency should have its own separate area in the shop. I had more to say but I had hit the 500 character limit for the review and had to cut it down",1
The downloads are annoying but the gameplay is really enjoyable. Excellent voice acting too.,5
"Great graphics but it's let down by the number and size of things you have to download. As soon as it's installed you have to download another file before playing, then after every level you download even more. Sadly deleted as was spending longer downloading than playing",2
its a great game,5
great game. but levels are very short and the story and the start of each level is longer that the level.,3
its been a while since ive played a mobile game as good as this!,5
beutiful n amazing game,5
"great game, love it",5
Amaamamamaamzing game. I dont really like these type of games but this one is really good. I recommend playing this or atleast giving it a go there is no pay2win or anything.,5
The music is so energetic and my favorite card designer are part of the game,5
Great art style and graphics,4
Gg,5
good game. not a bad story. graphics are pretty,5
"this is a great game with great music aswell but, the position of the screen and the controls are the only problems. I have with this game besides those problems this game is still amazing",5
Looks quite fun，like it,5
love the game,5
1.2 gigabyte way too big for mobile game cant fit anything else on phone,1
So far the game been good the story been interesting and game play great but you should make it easier to download all the game I sent the last 8 mission download it pace by pace.,5
"Only recently got the game but i can tell you the story is deep and charcters and surroundings are gorgeous, the gameplay itself is simple and quick,i look forward to diving deeper into the story",5
Amazing game. Everything you would expect from Nintendo,5
nintendo nails it again,5
"Crash crash crash ,great why does it just crash constantly love nintendo but how about making a good mobile game that works,looks great but just crashs, nintendo first party console games are nearly allways amazing how bout putting effort in to making a goob mobile game that works,i mean this looks good,hate all fire emblom games and love all mario games apart from rubbish that is mario run ,cabable of so much delivering so little",1
pretty fun so far great animation and music,5
Lots of fun so far. Keen to try the Co op mode!,5
"fun game, looks amazing",5
gg,5
Large size storage,4
Amazing Game With Top Graphics.Devs Did What Player Want's Perfecly <3,5
i am enjoying it up to now,5
gg,5
good game,5
"very enjoyable so far, great graphics and music. I've not played enough to see if I bump into a paywall yet",4
I what more like this,5
great game,5
Another great mobile Nintendo experience.,5
Ok so far,3
"Cygames did it again! Played Granblue Fantasy (GBF) for some time and this game is like GBF but with different gameplay. A lot of elements such as individual character stories, fully voiced (Jap only) and nice event stories are from GBF, and new elements such as weapons forging and town building make this game amazing!",5
best game on the app store by far keep up the good work graphics and gameplay are smooth,5
Cool game,4
"download, download and download some more. the game is probably not even half the data needed to play, before beginning you have to download some and then there's more downloads to do as you play. this game is just a joke.",1
It's aight,4
"Not a bad game so far. Makes a change being 3D. Has an efficient tutorial, and the gameplay is quite fresh, however, I'm not really keen on the swipe to move malarkey. Just feels a bit clunky and inefficient at times. Would be nice if the were multiple options.",4
"A great game! Easy to play one-handed so it's perfect for my transit commutes. The music is absolutely amazing and unique, the graphics are very appealing.",5
nice,5
Looks like it'll be a great game. The issue I have is.... Before I installed it the app says it way 80-90mb. After download I opened the game which asked for 800mb+.... OK I wanna try it.... Played the intro then it's asking for 1-2gig more... Why wouldn't it be downloaded from the initial download of the app. That aside I started the game and had maximum graphics... Nope games too laggy let's change the graphics... Couldn't find an options button anywhere... Don't get me wrong it looks great.,3
I always wanted a game where your party members fight with you,5
can't play on chrome book?,1
just started really good,5
"Fun game, great soundtrack.",4
"The game is really fun and has lots of different ways to carry out a good team, the graphics are amazing as well and I love the fact you can shapeshift.",5
good game,5
fun game.,4
Not bad !😊,5
Great,5
fun =),5
fun,5
yup,5
Quack,5
How is this not available in Canada? Anyone in Canada would have to use a VPN just to try this!,1
Reminds me of playing Rune Story from Colopl. Cool characters and amazing gameplay but I would recommend anyone to play this game on a stronger device with good reception,4
It's a great game. Plenty fun,5
Nevermind...,5
another nice game from nintendo. really fun game. love the graphic.,5
really enjoying this game!,4
"I absolutely love this game! The only thing that is disappointing is the prices on buying resources. It is ridiculous. I would make more in app purchases if it wasnt so expensive. On top of that, the summoning rates are horrible, while it's expensive to summon in the first place. You can buy Diamantium to summon but it's expensive for just one summon where the rates are horrible. If the prices are more reasonable, with more flexibility on buying resources, more people would invest.",4
really fun to play and easy controls,5
"colorful and artsy. i like the music, and the dual character models seems like a rather unique idea.",3
fun,4
"The game has amazing vocals and graphics, and the story so far is actually not bad. The game mechanics are pretty cool and overall the game is pretty good. THE MUSIC IS FIRE",5
easily addicting.,5
"Good stuff, haven't hit a pay wall yet.",5
Absolutely love this so far. Love the art work and visuals. I'm new so im just praying i don't hit a money wall like every other game I've played.,5
fun times to be had,4
best music ever huge Nintendo fan and now I might talk to them Nintendo can you please make a mobile star fox game please,5
fantastic and very amazing graphics,5
A very fun experience with a very good story behind it. the characters are interesting fighting mechanics are grandiose. only thing to kinda be a bit annoying is the control scheme feel it would be better off with a scroll wheel built-in somewhere. but definitely something that is taken hours of my day some days without my realizing it,5
really fun game,5
Amazing so far! From fire emblem to Dragalia Lost Nintendo never ceases to amaze me with their quality insurance! Play it now boi! 😤,5
"Great visuals, music, voice acting and animation. You can tell a large publisher 8s behind this.",5
yeah,5
Unique gameplay and enjoying it for now,5
The game is something fresh and new in my life.,5
"At the beginning of starting the game, there are constant updates and download patches. There is an option to download patches on a batch to lower the frequency of downloads. Great story once you get it all figured out.",4
fun and easy to play,5
Its good,5
super adorable but i havent played enough to speak on how viable it is for f2p users like myself,4
"All it ever does it download stuff and waste space. Open the app, it downloads stuff for ages. Do a tutorial and starts the story, then takes ages downloading more stuff. Then it shows me how to summon characters, and then downloads more stuff. By then I got fed up and uninstalled it; no point getting an app just to waste space and not play it properly.",1
Can't play on my rooted device.,1
Must play... :),5
it is very good,5
Like it😀,5
"this game is amazing, the music is catchy, the animations are smoothe and overall this game is a must play In short this game has good animations, great sound, music that you can listen to for hours on end and a unique style of fighting, all on your mobile device 10/10",5
Great little time waster,5
fun active rpg,5
There seems to be a ~1gb download every 10 minutes.,2
Enjoyable thus far,4
nice!,5
The game is the most fun I've ever had out of a mobile game. The RNG loot could be better but it stopped crashing and the devs fix all the problems sent in. I'd recommend it.,5
fun game worth a go,5
great,5
fun,4
it's a very addicting game I will definitely recommend to friends,5
"Great game, really enjoyable",5
"Graphics are top notch, and for once I can turn into a bloody dragon!!!",5
"So far so good, only complaint is tht like all games like this you can pay to win. Plus its pretty pricey, Other than tht really enjoying it :)",4
not played yet as download time is very slow I have excellent connection so haven't a clue on why it's slow! but the game looks great,5
it's good and all but it taken most of my memory and it taken more than 1 hour to download half of it so I had no chance and installed it but it is awesome so I wasn't that much of a waste,2
Game crashes once every while on Co-op and loads of downloading still fun though.,4
Awesome so far,5
An amazing experience so far!,5
It's fun considering I only started yesterday,5
I love this game,5
fun,4
lots of stuff to pay for and the levels are really short but quite fun.,4
I Love this game. Beautiful graphics and needs a lot of space but worth it.,5
"Quite a nice game hidden behind a painful UX and too many downloads. Not a good experience, you spend more time not playing the game.",3
10 outta 10,5
A pleasure & delight to pass time with.,4
good,5
doesn't let me play,1
"Dragalia is a fun action/adventure title with a decent story campaign and solid mechanics. There's a lot more complexity to the game under the surface, with a lot of items and materials to keep track of, but that just adds depth for more advanced players. The co-op is pretty good, too.",4
"if i had to choose between Fire emblem Heroes or this game, i would say this is the better pick. it is a memory consuming game though but i still love it.",5
"as expected from nintendo, a quality game.",5
"just started playing but it's fun and it looks good. Drop rates seem really low, but they are generous with items necessary to summon",4
"pretty fun so far, like the story and the controls are easy to use.",5
So far story is interesting and controls are easy to use.,5
"This game is cute, music is cool and I just love it.",5
is gud,5
"Great graphics, great song, generous. Ooking forward to what the future holds for this game",5
So far? Amazing game,5
Awesome. I love the characters illustrations and voices. The story is pretty great too.,5
"This game is amazing. The voice line, the graphics, and the music are all great The stories are nice to read",5
"What can I say, I am very impressed with this game! Yes it is a gacha game but they are extremely generous with the currency so summons are not a problem at all. It is much better than I had anticipated as a gacha game and its a lot more than that.The game has very well made but easy touch controls, and the gameplay in itself is excellent quality with an A grade story and some animated cutscenes and voice acting, and voice acting in general when reading the story texts. You wont regret playing.",5
pretty fun game with a very cute art style!,4
way too much downloading not enough game play,2
fun and proper f2p rpg great work Nintendo,4
Nice little game although its about 900mb in total file size. the reason for 2 stars is the drag to move doesnt work all that well and i sometimes find myself running in the wrong direction. Would be much better if it was a joystick for movement and tap attack. Might come back back later but for now the controls are putting me off playing.,2
good little game,4
every level requires you to download more content.. Nintendo fans you deserve better,1
Really good game. Could you do a collaboration with capcom's breath of fire series specifically breath of fire 3 please.,5
"Great game with lots of interesting choices for characters and events, as well as an evolving story",5
love it - Thank you Nintendo x,5
"First the game download size was initially 80.50mb, but then the additional download was 3GB in size and my phone doesn't have enough storage :(",1
"Horrible change to screen. Why was It changed, I want it back that way it was before update :(",5
Absolutely exceptional game. The devs are incredibly generous with the currency and every character is designed very well. Must have if you are a fan of Gacha Games,5
not bad,5
I will rate better if I can actually get on the game!!! It says it keeps failing to connect to server so I cant play it plzz fix this,2
great,5
neat little f2p game,5
Good so far,5
is a rewarding game of skill and teamwork. the gatcha mechanic is neat but is not necessary to win thr game itself offers enough free sommons to get by.,5
Exellent game for the whole family from young and old,5
its ok,5
"Great phone game, love the voice acting..breathes more life into the game! Nice fluid combat (most fluid gameplay I've seen on a phone game imo). Only reason it doesn't get 5*'s..it lacks enough content to keep us dedicated players busy enough. I know they just recently released void battles..but there are many who just don't need these weapons. The game still lacks that extra content to fill the void of no PvP content. We need some sort of challenge mode that provides monthly goal rewards!",4
closest thing to a real game on a phone,5
amazing graphic n game,5
Fun and fast paced.,5
love it,5
"Fun game, updates frequently and sizably.",5
Fun game!,5
love the game.,5
"pretty good I love the story and things like that, the only reason it's not 5 star is because I'm super bad at the game :-(",4
very fun! also doesnt totally kill my phones battery which i thought it would - 10/10 would keep playing,5
"The events are a little repetitive, but over all the developers are very generous with their player base so they have earned my loyalty.",4
Fun game,5
i love this game sooo much. i hope it comes to switch,5
great so far,5
fun gameplay!,5
Just amazing? No No its really Awsome guys i didnt expect this on android. great job Team Nintendo. and the game follows through at an impressive FPS rate. plus the story has great depth into it. maybe some tweaks will be needed here and there. but in all 4.5 out of 5 for me.,4
"Good music, gameplay and okay for a gacha.",5
Worth a try for anyone who is interested.,4
best mobile game ive played in a very long time !,5
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful game :,)",5
"Played the intro. Game seems good, but the amount of downloads is ridiculous. I've uninstalled it - after downloading over 1gb yesterday, it wanted to do another 1gb today. Too memory and data hungry for my liking. Stick it on the 3ds as a free download and I'll try it again!",3
nice and simple. plays well for a portable action game. in the end though it's like all other gatchas. summons seem expansive also.,4
awsome game so far!,5
fun little monster catcher sim,5
It's fun so far.,3
i like how the character bobs to the music,5
Very Good Game so far,5
"I'm so glad this game is finally available in New Zealand! This game is astoundingly awesome, great designs everywhere from the characters, the monsters and the actual game mechanics. It's fun to play and the music is absolutely amazing.",5
Fun so far!,5
fun and easy to play!,5
"took all most a year for it to come to the eu but worth the wait, it is a fun lil game",5
I game I have bean waiting to play and boy its a fun game nintendo did a bang up job well done now I have somthing fun to do on the go,5
Finally available in the uk and not disappointed,5
Lots o fun,5
Entertaining for sure.,5
beautiful game!,5
wonderful game,5
"great little game, graphics are really impressive and it seems very f2p. enjoying the story so far which is rare for a mobile game!",5
banana banana lemon pledge jump off a cliff and cut the hedge,5
it's fun,5
"Great game, but the summon rates are pretty unfair",4
Awesome,5
"Really enjoying so far, but not very far in. Seems plenty to keep a f2p interested. Controls are simple and easy to pick up. Theres is a lot to take in at the beginning.",4
Very polished game with cool characters.,5
thank you for releasing Dragalia Lost in Canada!,5
"Dragalia Lost is a mix between Fire Emblem and Xenoblade... Even, the main hero looks like Shulk... LOL New franchise by Nintendo and probably the best mobile title since Super Mario Run! Nevertheless, the in-app purchases are very expensive... But, It seems that with a little grinding... they can be avoided all together... I hope! Another great mobile title from Nintendo to play until MarioKart for mobile will be ready to be released for summer 2019. Great work like always Nintendo! 😉👌",5
"Pretty good gatcha game with Nintendo's support. unique gameplay, generous drop rates and great graphics/music.",5
Best mobile Nintendo game yet!,5
A gacha game that makes you feel loved.,5
"Early impressions feel good, engaging combat and cool art :D",5
"All the production values and refined, intuitive gameplay l'd expect from a collaboration between Nintendo and CyGames!",5
Great fun and interesting story,5
"damn, the music is a banger.",5
"enjoying my time i have put into the gane, mechanics are simple so far but enjoyable. price of in game purchases seems reasonable compared to other gatcha games. fair amount of free currency so far but thats the norm for the start of these games. gfx are pleasing. all in all i will be spending more time with this game good game play and not spamming me continuously with buy now offers. GJ",5
great fun,5
A fast paced delight with a plethora of custom features.,5
I'm so happy you finally released in Canada!! I absolutely love this game. And I generally don't like mobile games. keep up the great work and fun events. cheers~,5
best nintendo game to date,5
great game shame it took so long to be released in aus,5
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
This game is beautiful!,5
"So glad it has finally been released in the uk. Really enjoyed playing it, a fun ARPG with plenty of growth and you dont feel the need to pay to play. Everything seems achievable without having to spend. Probably Nintendo's finest mobile game.",5
"For a genre overdone on mobile devices, the wheel hasn't been reinveted here, but it certainly has been improved on. Fun. Easily playable without encountering the pay wall, time friendly dungeons and deep mechanics for a mobile game. Worth it.",5
"man the soundtrack of this game is incredible. it doesnt run particularly great, and its fairly complicated, but its worth it for the soundtrack.",4
"so far, so good. hard to tell what it will be like after getting to end game",4
An amazing game that's a whole lot of fun!,5
fun little arpg could do with better way to get summons that don't require money.,5
"Reminds me of the old Ys games with a breath of fire like transformation, Great 😀",5
"This game is among the best mobile games I've ever played. The music is awesome, the gameplay is simple to pick up and satisfying to master, every unit is viable for almost all content (even 3 stars) and I've been playing for 5 months straight without any sort of burnout. That's unheard of for me.",5
"Finally available in Canada I've watched friends play this and now I'm finally able to play it! i absolutely love Daoko, the gameplay, the aesthetic it's great",5
"I absolutely love this game! The controls are simple to use and the gameplay is rarely repetitive. Like all Nintendo games, this is playable with one hand, which I really enjoy, and there are pretty much NO ADS, which I really respect. The one thing is that you are constantly downloading data. As soon as you open the app, you download almost 900mb, which isn't that bad. Then, you have to download 1.26GB after playing the tutorial. Each level you have to download. but you can dnld it all at once.",5
good cute dragons,5
Fun little time waster.,4
Been waiting so eagerly for this. Loving it so far!,5
"A very good game, good music, sound effects, voice acting, graphics... Etc... Too many to mention!",5
"Great jrpg, but too many load screens. Still worth playing though.",4
"So far, fun as hell. Presentation is great, however I could see this game performing poorly on older devices.",5
Reviews of free games are pointless. Just jump in and play. Your experience will vary from someone who values something different.,5
Great gacha!!!,5
awesome!,5
"Looks nice and music is nice, fun",5
"Better than most gacha games. The gameplay style is average, I do wish you could attack with one hand while moving with the other. The gameplay really feels slow and stuck because it's either attack or move. The summon rates are a nice 4%, for some reason held back from 5%. I have a specific hate for how much a summon costs. 150 per single and 1500 for a multi summon is asking too much since collection is about 25 at a time. I feel like i'll eventually stop playing because of how bad the cost is",3
smooth gameplay and easy controls.,4
"Best f2p gacha game and best developers. they actually listen to the community. SSR rates are bad but they give you a lot of free summons. Awesome music, gameplay, characters and stories.",5
why should I need wifi for a 3.5 gig game,4
nice,5
it's been addictive,5
it is a great game but the only thing that is not so good is how much space it takes if they were to make a lite version of Draglia like they did fire emblem heroes maybe more players would play the game.,1
"It's your standard Freemium game with a ""Summon your allies"" type system but your summons don't just give you units, they can also give you Transformations, Items and Equipment. Most would say this is just a cash cow, I would say it's a freemium game done right. No Ads, Pay if you want to, combat is brilliant and you're given enough gifts to start the game with a strong team straight away. A+ Nintendo, you've done it again.",5
"I don't write many reviews because games like this I never play for too long. But Nintendo seem to know how to publish games that are both easy to understand and easy to control. the interface is much easier on the eyes then your standard, cramped screen of boxes and flashy colours. the game feels nice to control and satisfying to play. Simple yet challenging. It's got Fun upbeat music mixed with bright colours. Only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because perfection is impossible. 🌟",4
F2P friendly,5
Proper good innit,5
Beautiful game with an interesting story. Highly recommend.,5
its a fun mobile game different from the others,5
cute fun rpg with dragons!!!!,5
Quality,5
Great time.,5
Really enjoyable!,5
"This is Nintendo's best mobile game. This game is so much fun and extremely rewarding, the developers are extremely giving when they make a mistake, other gacha games should learn from how amazing Dragalia Lost is.",5
Classic cygame generosity with the free 5 star. There is alot of ingame screens though like gbf.,5
Typical gacha game. Extremely disappointed,2
"First: Fix the updates. Stop having store updates for 50mb, just to open the game and have another required update 10x the size. Minor second: Fix leveling relationships with dragons. It takes to long, a feed all would suffice. Not hard to say that I really enjoy this game overall. They work hard to fix things and are happy to throw units at you for every small mistake they have. Mentioned above get fixed Ill change my rating to 5☆",3
"Great RPG game, but the game crashes when you select the Castle Grounds option, had to go to Dragon's Roost to access the Grounds.",4
Great and fun game!,5
its good,4
It's ok,5
"Fun game that runs great! Have not been tempted to spend money yet, they seem to be pretty generous with currency.",5
Awesome mobile game! would definitely recommend,5
"wow. The mobi game i've been hoping for. long time Final fantasy Brave exvius player. the game turned into just gatcha with no gameplay outside of a few battles with increasing difficulty. this game blows it out of the water. its fun, VERY generous with in game currency and looks amazing on my s8+ to boot. even allowing for a full screen experience. deffinate gotcha game, with above average fun gameplay. give it a shot, its got nintendo behind it after all.",5
Finally came out in Australia!!,5
well made and really fun.,5
pretty good so far.,4
"its a great game, great mechanics, great graphics, i gave it 4 star becuaee you have to download almost every level, I'd have been more happy with a big initial download",4
epic,5
been fun,4
controls take some time getting used too but once you do it's a very enjoyable game,5
"really happy with the game , Nintendo has done it again .",5
One of the best gacha games,5
"Pretty interesting game I can play on the go with a nice Action RPG battle mechanic to keep it active, controls take awhile to get used to but are serviceable enough",4
Great game so far. Very entertaining and cool cut scenes.,5
great game so far,5
3* so far,3
this game is very fun and cool good work on the game.l love it❤😄,5
"very F2P friendly, but also a grind. I wish it was easier to max rewards during events because as it is that is very time consuming.",5
"Beautiful game. Love the story so far, the characters are all quirky and fun in their own ways, they have some good lore behind most of them, i love the dragon designs, and this is the only game on mobile with content that keeps me coming back every time. For a gacha game, the experience is so well thought out that you can't miss the chance to play a game like this. Would give 10 stars if i could.",5
I absolutely love this game!!!,5
"please re-enable splitscreen, i can't co-op properly with my friend from overseas.. thanks.",3
"Cute game, a lot to learn very quickly, but I'm enjoying it so far",4
To much downloading. Deleted,1
not bad. feels like a real new contender in the action rpg world.,4
decent visuals games ok. i wish it wasnt drag to move and i wish i could rotate my screen while playing so i can feel more into the game. their is too many flashy stuff in the menu make more simplisitic and less flashy it just looks clunky and clusterd but if these are fixed or done i will recomend this game to friends as of now i cant,2
Fabulous!,5
"Thank you for finally releasing this in Australia. Now I don't have to rely on apk's anymore. This game is pretty f2p friendly. New events are every few weeks and they give you plenty of wyrmite/tickets, (used for summoning characters) as well as the dev's actually care about the community and take our feedback into consideration when making changes. I highly recommend you at least give the game a try.",5
"I have played a few mobile games in my time, but never have I seen such dedication in improving the game as I have seen it here. The constant QoL updates make the gameplay and experience more fluid with every update. Adding to that the constant content additions they make and F2P happy oriented focus makes this game the best mobile experience for me!",5
Love this game I cant wait to see how far they go with it!(from first version) Many updates later I would like to add that this game is fantastic so much added I feel like it's a new game and I'm scrambling to keep up with end game so much F2P currency still. If you haven't tried this game you need to. highly recommended I will continue playing this game for awhile.,5
"This game is the best good music, graphics, gameplay and plus and they even made comics for fun, I love it!! I'll give it a 5 stars",5
amazing.,5
"one of thebest games i have ever played . the graphic is cute and awesome , the story is interesting and the characters are all super lovable and the voice acting for both eng / jpn is amazing i really love this game ♡♡♡♡♡",5
Needs PVP. The game got really boring after you complete all the regular content and every event is the same.,3
"Beautiful, absolutely charming game with very fun gameplay and a wonderful story.",5
"really fun game, amazing art, and interesting story",5
"4gb download before you can play, constant downloads before every mission. why is the initial download not enough? why do i have to sit here watching it download? spent more time downloading than actually playing",1
good,5
The game is really fun so far and it's super easy to pick up and play. You definitely don't have to be super hard core to enjoy. Good game for when you have a minute to spare. 👌,5
Couple of hours in and I've been enjoying the game. Nice action game play and a fun hero collector.,5
Amazing game.,5
Decent gacha game.,5
"I used to play a bunch of phone games but this game has become my one and only phone game. They are constantly updating, listen to player feedback, and are very generous with the game currency. The new void battles are a blast too.",5
fun game,4
"Pretty fun, not sure what all the negative views are about.",5
It takes a lot of space but so far I've found a lot of charm in this game I definitely suggest checking it out.,5
it's been pretty good so far.,5
"Easy to figure out. pretty, good soundtrack. lots of fun",5
"This game proves that when you put entertainment and fun gameplay at the forefront, you can't go wrong. Even for a mobile game.",5
like the movement,5
awesome,5
"Not very good but not very bad somethings like setting helpers wasn't very straightforward and nothing helped to learn how to do that. Also, the art style was just too cutesy felt like the game was designed for toddlers",3
"cool story,good game play",5
"Fun and easy to learn. It is best to download it all up front, though. If not, you'll have to stop between each level to do so.",5
"you'd think Nintendo, being a large established company would be better about fixing things when it's app malfunctions by draining one's wymrite but then giving no summon. three times in a row in the course of about 3 days, when i summoned and used 150 wyrmite each time to do so, the game would say dragalia lost has stopped responding and then when i logged back in, i saw my wymrite was 150 less and i had no summoned thing to show for it. they did nothing to fix this. I'm done.",1
fun,5
"great game, love that Nintendo brought something awesome to the mobile platform that I can enjoy and play all day. in-app purchases are totally worth it. kudos to the Developers",5
So far one of the best games i've ever played 10/10👌🏾,5
it is a very fun game and the story makes up for the game play. if it had a joystick option it would be the best game to play.,5
i can now finally rock the dragon.,5
very good and additive,4
fun,5
"Well designed, fun to play, overall pretty good so far.",5
"Pretty good! I'm just wrapping up the tutorial part of the game, but I like it so far.",5
awesome game. all around,5
good,5
"well, after spending close to two hours trying to find a party who could beat void zephyr, people are not making the specialized weapons and if one person is without then everyone fails. this is the kind of time sink i definitely don't enjoy. void battles ruined it for me. time to uninstall!",2
💪💯💯,5
"I liked this game a lot and had hopes for it, but it went down the drain with the Void battles. In Void battles Might doesnt matter, you can be way over and still lose. The Void Zephyr fight is atrocious, it forces everyone to get hit with the Dull debuff which makes it near impossible to kill him. I tried countless times and none of the groups I had had enough damage to take hime down before the timer it 0. It just a big disappoinment. Uninstalled.",3
"Love the 3D graphic, love the gameplay, love the story and the music is so amazing and just makes me wanna dance everytime I hear it!",5
"This game plays like an actual game! I'm not sure everyone understands how crazy this is. The characters aren't static sprites, you have full control of the movement, and and full 3D models. That said, it's still a gatcha.",5
Love the idea of a good one,5
solid.,4
Nintendo is a great company because the console were my childhood,5
So fun!,5
"The gotcha games need to go. I'd happily spend 60+ on a good game and do micro transactions for fun little additions or custom outfits and pets gambling for pixels that I can never walk away with anything of actual value is lame. I'll play the game and never spend, and send my money to something like a complete game like the new Dragon Quest. You can do better than this. The draw rates ridiculous and duplicate 5 stars like I keep getting make me want to uninstall this game.",2
love this game,5
almost like a real game for our game consoles would love to see this game become a console game i would buy it,5
Great game. Nostalgic. Nintendo has a great game on its hand. Original story! What more could you ask for.,5
purely gacha.,1
so enjoyable and fun,5
I wish there was a hard mode. It is kind of easy. It's a challenge because of low hp.,5
would get a five but it won't download the rest of the content please help,4
best top yes,5
an amazing amazing game,5
Gatcha Game. Story seems good.,4
good game,5
"Takes up way too much space on my phone, and the main story is slow to update, but is insanely addictive. Has some of the best written dialogue I've seen, especially in a mobile game. Great that missions only take a few minutes, which is perfect for a mobile game.",4
Amazing,5
great game. always the best from nintendo,5
Fair / Fun,5
no way to recover account if not linked to a Nintendo account,1
thos game is cool,5
No auto attack feature but Very good voice acting. Did not receive the tenfold Summon Voucher for update though.,4
"seems good so far. lot of load screens and data to dl on each one, but small and fast files. give it a shot if u like luck of the draw games",4
"Its such a great, adicting app!",5
"I am so glad that I decided to take the plunge! This is such an excellent game. Wonderful gameplay, beautifully crafted and a compelling story. Don't let the fact that it's a gacha game defer you from playing it because it is truly a wonderfully built game.",5
cooh,5
cute style. grinding isnt that bad even if it takes a while.,5
One of the most fun games I've played on my phone.,4
very good,5
it was good story progresses at to slow my face but it's really good,5
awesome very entertaining,5
Super polished.,5
awesome game,5
The game is amazing the art is also amazing,5
fun to play its a nice little time waster,5
"Well made and published by Nintendo. It's an interesting, albeit somewhat cliché, story, a lot of endgame content, and really fun game mechanics.",4
support code 160 error. maybe stop being so against people who actually want to play your game,1
👍I like it,5
"needs a good phone to play it (I previously had a note 4 and it ran horribly). Good story. easy to learn system, and the summoning is fun. no surprise, being from Nintendo and all.",5
amazing story and gameplay,5
I lik it,5
"Absolutely useless. I was installing the game on a 15 gb free device. After waiting for it to finish downloading for hours, it stops when there is 0.01MB of data left and tells me there is insuffcient storage. How is this even possible? Forced to clear the cache and redownload the entire 3GB. What kind of joke is this? Absolutely shameful. This game never ceases to dissapoint me.",1
First screen: Download 800+ MB of Data? Don't list your app as 80 MB and then immediately require almost a gigabyte of content before you can even play. BS,1
Lovely UI & Art director! Nintendo stan forever 💕,5
Entertaining game with very good production values.,5
fun,5
"great gameplay, story, and graphics. gatcha rates are garbage but story more than makes up for it",4
This game is amazing and I love it,5
good,5
"decent game, but boring quick. all there is to do is grind same levels over and over.",4
Good Song..good graphic.. Worst control,4
Metroid on mobile apps?,4
New update for the game came out. Can't update the game at all. tried to reinstall it can't even do that. now I lost everything 🤬 really upset.......,1
good so far and fluid gameplay,4
Downloaded it good game made some purchases got a new phone account doesn't exist anymore its not saved unless you link to Nintendo really awful,1
Fun way to pass time.,5
Pretty good i must say,5
awesome game,5
This is great!,5
gg,5
"Man, this is a great game but only if you are willing to give up your storage space.",4
neat,5
so much fun.,5
so far so good,4
it's a great experience the graphics are amazing the action and adventure is fun and interesting and I live playiing it as the challenge draws you in more.,5
kingdom hearts,4
I love this game. I would definitly recommend this to someone.,5
awesome gameplay nintendo is the best,5
awesome fun game!,5
I love the game. its fun and the song is auite addicting. the stories of thr drahond and people is really thought out,5
it's fun experiance and good time killer,5
this is my first Nintendo game I ever played on my phone and it's so awesome,5
"I Love this game, always something new happening. I wish this could be a switch game!!! It is unlike any other mobile game. Definitely a must have.",5
A lot of fun!,5
weebs game,5
Great game love the support from the developers. Any time there is a bug the fix it quickly.,5
"my name is Comander Shepard, and this is my favorite waifu collector on the Citadel.",4
I am very so so about the game. One the drawbacks being is that you have to download each and every time you enter a chapter. Sure a couple mb is not much but over time I am seeing it to be an issue.,5
"Instant addict, looks like I have my go to mobile game now",5
i absolutely love this game... the only downside is that i had to uninstall it because my phone was getting restored and i tried to access my old account with All my high level warriors and dragons and i had to start over from the beginning... yes im salty but its a good game,4
very good,5
i just want to play this game. not v accessible if you don't have internet or data.,1
love this game . music is catchy and the characters are cute,5
"the banners percentages are bs. ive pulled 10 5 stars since this game released and have not pulled a single character or dragon that was from the current banner. And thats after using all the extra wyrmrite and 10 pull tickets from all the events since the game started. nothing's instant, theres a little loading screen between every section, even going to the home screen. everything takes too long to do. even simple things like upgrading weapons takes forever.",3
Extremely free to play friendly. Good gameplay and fun experience. Now if they could just port this to the Nintendo Switch it would be golden,5
generous gacha game,5
"I did enjoy the games story, graphics, music, gameplay, wyrms, building system and characters with individual voices and personality. However, the game needs some serious overhaul. The upgrade system is to time consuming with very little amount of rewards items to upgrade weapons, characters, wyrmprints etc. Characters fighting mechanics have serious delays which causes you to get hit often. Theres no way to sell or discard unused weapons or items. Events are very repetitive, a chore and boring.",2
"Deserves 5* rating.. troll 1* reviews from when game launched and had a bug for the first day caused people to lose their mind.. not changing their rating afterwards. Its the best mobile game I've played by a signficant margin.. been playing Fire emblem heroes since launch and this game blew me away with how much better it is at launch than Fire emblem is after almost two years now. I haven't stopped playing since it launched. Try it! So many features. Music is great, lots of fun to be had :)",5
"Runs nice, I have bad luck in gacha games though.",4
Nintendo please keep up the good work,5
good game not for casual gamers because u wont get much out of the events.,4
"Well done on this one, Nintendo! I'm very much looking forward to the inevitable anime, not to mention the Smash Bros. appearances! ;)",5
love it nothingless,5
"This game is fun, and also has a nice story behind it too!",5
I like it,5
Love this game,5
very good game,5
Music is bomb and the characters are adorable!,5
upgrading needs some serious overhauling. the requirements to craft next tier weapons is so ridiculous and consuming nm of materials and time i quit. can easily spend 30 minutes just maxing out a single weapon from crafted base to elemental max. and doesn't seem worth it when crafted base or next tier max will carry you through. everything takes too long cant move through story fast enough and the Ai is trash. tired of auto skill activating and because my character is ending animation gets hit.,3
awesome game,5
Please add more voiced English lines.,4
it is quite a good time passer and it is fun! lots of new content each month to give you something to keep coming back to.,5
I enjoy the story and the fun gameplay. it's simple yet fun.,5
Fun game with great devs.,5
great mix of everything. runs great and has an awesome story. no complaints!,5
lots of fun so far,5
good. that is all.,5
"For as long as I've been using a smartphone, I've never had an app update of any kind that requires the phone screen to stay on and also not be using another app while the update completes. I downloaded the game, left the screen on during the update and waited for 53 minutes only to see the update was nowhere near being finished. The game of course was uninstalled. The seemingly endlesss and inexcusable incompetence by Nintendo is beyond ridiculous.",1
"loving the game sofar, a little handholdy at times but super cute and love the story :)",5
extremely addictive cutesy Graphics lots of fun,5
Fun action JRPG. The graphics is amazing for a mobile game. Overall good game and worth the time. The music is unbelievably catchy and you will be humming it....,4
"legit has became my favorite gacha game i played. fantastic feed back, fun gameplay, great music, and very enjoyable to play",5
"Reason: By Cygames, that's all",5
"A linear battle dungeon game with epic boss fights, and a storyline that is okay. Stamina system doesn't hold you back until passing level 30 and is refunded when a quest is failed, which is great for starting out. I'd give 5.5 stars if the english dub was full instead of partial.",5
ssdc,4
The bois are cute therefore it is good.,5
ah,5
good experience,5
"the game is good so far i will save star rateing for later , but why are all the charters just dark figures is this how they are sapose to bee if not how do i fix.",2
"simple enough game play, captivating story, and great graphics",5
Good time waster,4
should have landscape view,4
good,5
loving the one handed play style,5
fun game,5
nice graphic and fun to play... but the control a little bit inconvinient,5
"Fantastic game, only really marred by the terrible wyrmprint mechanic which only serves to lessen your chance of pulling something actually useful from the gacha.",3
Wonderful game! Always keeps me going with each and every event.,5
This Game is Lit as hell 🔥🔥🔥 and its one of my favorite games try it out it has good story and good graphics,5
"I used to think that mobile games weren't so great but this game has changed my mind. I like the characters, the setting and the gameplay. I'm very happy so far with my experience with Dragalia Lost.",5
not bad,4
fun stuff bruh,5
"nice graphics, music, and voice acting, but the gameplay itself just isn't very fun, to be honest... it doesn't really feel like you're controlling much more than the general path your party takes through each very short, very straightforward level.",3
A lot of content and characters with actual story depth. I'm glad my brother recommended this!,5
"I had binded my acc in the past when i changed phones it was like it never existed so as you can imagine after losing all the hard work i was salty and put the game down for awhile but I missed it alot. Losing my acc is the only reason for 4 stars, it is a gacha so take that as you will.",4
Fun Game!!!,5
"I love the gameplay, graphics, catchy music, and the voices/story. I would give this a 5 star if the tutorial for coop can be fixed. I'm having problems with it loading endlessly causing me to not be able to continue on with the game. If u can fix this problem then that'll be great. Besides that, everything in the game is spectacular so far!*edit: Thank you for fixing the issue and keep up the good work! I will update u if they are any more problems but for now everything is good.",5
it's fun,5
"Poor combat, grindy weapon systems, and lack luster characters.",2
fun new kinda gacha game but gacha rates hurt,5
perfect 👌,5
sad,1
Had a fun time,5
not as good as Fate Grand Order,5
fun,5
"It is a fun rpg with simple combat but decently complex customization. Recommend for people that want a decent phone game. Does have gacha though, so be prepared for that.",5
fun!,4
best game awesome i want free tjimg bbbbbbbeeeessssttttt gggaaammmeee eeevvveewrrr love you 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀☺☺☺☺☺☺☺😁😁😁😁😁😁😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞,5
fun and well made,4
It's fun. I like the raid parts. It is a grinding game. They have purchased gem store only separate summons.,3
"Simple, but very fun. Transactions are an option, but they don't push it in your face like other games. Very nice visuals too. Overall polished game.",4
Pretty fun Gatcha. Relatively simple and enjoyable little dungeon crawler.,5
very lovely gameplay.,5
Very good,5
pretty fun so far. lots of downloaded updates have wifi for sure.,4
"Well polished RPG from Nintendo. I love the graphics, characters, and voice overs! Controls are pretty meh but it's made up with charm. Wish this was an anime!",5
the best time killer and fun to play,5
fun but grindy,4
This game is amazing I love everything about it!,5
Really fun and addictive nice to hear characters talk for a change,5
Surprisingly fun game. I enjoy the portrait mode play but wish they'd add in landscape support too.,5
good stuff,5
Really fun game. The only complaints are that loading takes a while for most screens and the size is a bit large.,4
great game! as expected from Cygame,5
fun game just playing the co op tho,5
"Game is good but consumes so much memory you'd be lucky to finish ch.1 before running out of room, highly recomend playing on a tablet or if you have a lot of memory on your phone.",3
server stabiluty makes the game almost unplayable currently.,2
i love it,5
its a very amazing game too play,5
Wonderful,4
"Pay to win, that's all",2
"Nice looking, fun, gacha game. My real big problem is that everything just goes so...slowly. A vast majority of the time I spend on this game is just with collecting resources, upgrading, and building. Maybe 20% of my time is actually spent playing maps. Transition animations not being skippable throughout the game make it feel so...slow. Compared to Nintendo's other mobile gacha, Fire Emblem Heroes feels significantly snappier.",3
"so far it's awesome, amazing soundtrack.",5
amazing all around,5
pretty good so far,4
nice game.,5
best nintendo game yet,4
I would rate a 5 if I could actually play the game. it constantly crashes on me.,2
So far the story is good.,5
"Great visuals, so far decent story, controls take a bit to get used to but nothing too serious. When moving if that big arrow can be removed or made smaller that would be great ! Thanks",5
"An amazing game indeed. It has a great story, possibly one of the only gacha games that isn't a pay to win. I just wish there was a way to change the music in the home screen. All the soundtracks are amazing. I just wish I could change them in the menu or something.",5
i really want to give this game 5 stars but i feel the system of quests is just tedious. The game plays extremely well and i would definitely pay top dollar for a larger scale game that has less loading barriers and more play time.,4
"I'm cautously optimistic abou what I have played so far. I expect it to be more pay to win in later sections, but what's really jarring is the constant section downloads. would have rathered a chapter by chapter download system.",4
It's a very fun game! I wish it worked faster on older phones though. Although it takes up alot of space it's very much worth it! Nintendo really outdid themselves!,5
Terrible gacha. I was hoping for characters but it gave me more wyrmprints that I could possibly make use of. I spent hundreds and got nothing but junk I never wanted. Should have unistalled a long time ago,1
We're home blue,4
Great controls and lots of fun,5
"Controls are horrid to the effect that you cant get out of the way or walk out of areas that could get you killed, bad rng programmed to ensure you don't get anyrhing good, and the game takes up WAY too much space for the small graphics/cheap gameplay. I loved this game and spend money on it, but latest update seemingly made my characters much less powerful and the events are horrible. Sad such a waste of a game come from Nintendo, of all places. Sad to say it, but pretty close to uninstalling.",1
"Interesting plot, fun action... very engrossing.",5
gg,4
its kewl,3
Amazing,5
"I really like this! The devs seem to listen to the playerbase and are constantly trying to improve the game. They also have events about twice times every month that last about a week and a half that keep the game engaging. The story so far is cliche, but still pretty fun. And oh boy, there are sooo many different types of dragons you can get. Honestly, it was all of the dragons that ultimately sold me on this game.",5
"Very cute, with lots of characters to enjoy. The music and graphics are some of the best for a mobile game. Game play is fairly easy for a while, however, and does not become challenging until you've reached higher levels.",5
"For a mobile game, it controls and plays really really well. Almost everything about this game is a 10/10 perfect feature, but the one thing that I really can't enjoy is just how much of a grind this game is. It's like trying to catch up on 2 years of gacha game content when it's only been out for 6 months or so.",4
Very fun has that Nintendo charm to it would love to see Euden in Smash fun controls cool aesthetic dragon are dope,4
"Game was good, however the community is AWFUL. Much of this game relies on co-op play and if you're a new player trying to get into this ""veteran"" players will close the lobby as soon as you enter and mock you with emotes. For the latest event there were stages I couldn't even play because every lobby would kick me. The events are really all this game has going for it anyway.",1
"peppy music, smooth art, and my fossil of a phone can run it so that makes it accessible.",4
it good,5
"The gameplay, mechanics, and co-op are really fun, but the story files take up waaay too much space. Wish there was an option to delete files of completed chapters. Also, playing with friends is kind of hard since everytime you switch missions you have to enter a new code. The new update also kind of hurt co-op since the host has to use getherwings instead of stamina.",4
"highly addictive. I find myself coming back to this game every day. constant updates and events mske the game engaging and the characters are adorable. the musical score is like an ear worm, not sure why anyone would want to turn it off. as great of an actual story though, its a little weak.",5
Nice,5
"Don't even bother downloading this game. It look pretty but the developer makes all the error of mobile gaming. Too much resources to do anything even like trying to max out a weapon. Now during an event they make a boss so big it more than twice your mobile screen, you cannot even see yourself much less trying to move out the way of it attack. This game is wait for 8 hours to play for 15 to 30 min.",1
ok but too many downloads. requires a download every stage gets aggravating,3
"This game is really fun! I did have trouble with all the downloads at first but maybe my internet got better? anyway, the gameplay is fun and there are a lot of great characters. my favorite part is honestly the variety in characters. finally some characters with melanin XD and not just sexy girls, sexy boys too! the only critique i have at this point is that it can be hard to organize all the upgrading, everything needs to be upgraded and its hard to stay on top of.",4
fun. wish there weren't so many downloads,4
"Honestly, I initially liked this game, or at least aspects of it. I dig the graphics, the story, Daoko's music, the dragons & characters. What I absolutely HATED was the method for movement. Whoever thought up the manner of navigation in the stages should be fired. At least give gamers the option for a stationary control pad instead. Also, the amount of space this game requires is bad enough, yet it never ends. Every time you open the game, play a new level, level up a character or dragon, anything, everything, there's more and more and more to download. It would be fine if this were a console game, but it's insanity for a mobile device.",2
"it's a fun game, give it a try if you're thinking about it",5
haha waifu game,5
really fun,5
Awesome game with awesome graphics.,5
"still playing this game, i tried out many games with similar gatcha systems and i have to say this is one of the more generous games in terms of the quantity of in game currency they give you and how easy it is to get it usually. have gotten new story updates to the main campaign thankfully and the developers send out gifts pretty often which is nice. however it still is a game with a gambling system in it so i can't give it 5 stars for that reason. but it is the most generous out of all of them",4
dragon waifu brunhilda big rawr and good gameplay since im used to grinding so its not bothering me on farming,5
good game,5
"It's a really nice game. Simple, but fun to play. In the beginning, things are slow and you can't really get into the fun of fighting because it's over so quickly. But I have a feeling that'll change later in the game.",5
awesome game nice summons and turning into a dragon is bad azz,5
its good. play it. plz,5
fun and good story so far,5
Fun to play and a variety things to keep you in the game. The story in the game is done well.,4
love it don't stop,5
Controls are below average but the rest of the game makes up for it.,4
awesome,5
overall pretty good.,4
It's very annoying that you guys won't separate the summons into different pulls. for every adventurer or Dragon there are like 4 wyrmprints. Give players the ability to summon for what they need in their party instead having everything contained in one giant summoning pool. This is the main reason I have left the game.,3
"The game is very entertaining, the story is amazing, and the characters are very enjoyable. However, I wish I can get more warriors or dragons when I summon. I keep getting wyrmprints all the time and it's the same ones over and over again. I know I have bad luck, but I wish the chances for summoning a warrior or a dragon are higher",5
very good,5
good game,4
"the game is absolutely amazing, they are extremely generous with giving summoning material, the team that runs this game are amazing, they care so much about the fanbase and how they can improve the game.",5
Simply the best game ever! Love everything of this adventure!!!,5
great game,5
the game is fun but alot of downloading is involved for each mission,4
6 times I tried to install this. Each time the download stuck at 99% and that was 6 times to many. Try a different game and save yourself the headache. Forget this game! .........Months later the game did install.... Its a pretty game but very generic.,1
j. Salinas Joey's love,5
"Fun in the beginning but boring after! There are seven zones to work through. After you finish them initially, you can work through them again at a harder setting. Once that's done, it's just grinding extra missions to get materials for upgrading. Materials upgrading high level items are few and far between which means constant grinding. To alleviate the monotony, they introduce special events frequently but they have become formulaic and end in more grinding. I feel like I'm wasting my time.",3
This is a very pretty and fun action RPG / dungeon crawler.,5
Really enjoyable so far. love the story and the fighting. Excellent job devs,5
fun with a good story,4
its fun. nothing bad about it.,5
It's a nice time killer.,4
very good game,5
gameplay is amazing and my personal appeal towards this gacha. The waifus are a bit hit or miss and the special events can be way too easy but I wholeheartedly recommend this game.,4
One of the few mobile games I've played once and got hooked. The UI is beautiful and the gameplay is smooth and a ton of fun. Constant support from the developers keeps players coming back after each QoL update. Thank you Cygames and Nintendo for this gem.,5
"very addictive, thank you for updating to fix the loading problem",5
just wish the experience wasn't limited to the mobile market,4
This is the best game ever played,5
the graphics are amazing! a good combination between 2d and 3d which is utilized amazingly !,5
The bast game i have played in 10 years!,5
this is so watermelon,5
best app ever 👌,5
"first off, nintendo second, dragons third, an actual good RPG on mobile",5
"great game and fun, it just takes up a lot of space.",5
Wubba lubba dub dub!,5
very fun tho is a pay to win you dont have to but it makes it a cake walk,4
Pretty good dungeon crawl.,5
I Just Love It !!! =),5
"I'm having fun with this game so far! The devs are continually providing support and qol updates, and making the gatcha part of the game actually reasonable by way of better rates and more rewards given more frequently. Aside from the size of the game itself, I don't really have much to complain about. Give it a shot!",5
"love this game, such a time consumer",5
great game had a ton of fun,5
"Other than the fact that it takes up over 3 GB of storage, it's a really great game. If you've got the storage then I strongly suggest downloading it.",4
"this game would be alot better if equipment was such a drag and had more variety to it in game, I've been with this game and yes it has raids to prevent us from getting bored and it's still new but it still has that "" something is missing "" feel to it",4
Love the game very good,5
When I play this game it makes me happy because of how much fun it is I like games that take long and that involves levels to be able to go on quest even that you could have a team these are the reason that I am happy and having fun.,5
this game was made perfectly nintendo was one of the rare mobile game makers and they scored a ten and a half star on my behalf. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,5
Pure Genis,5
I straight love everything about this game,5
"It's a wonderful game with an excellent story (so far), but hopefully they fix the controls and reduce the client size. Neither are completely awful, but could certainly use some improvement. Edit - They added two control options that improve the experience drastically.",5
The story is amazing the music is pretty catchy and I find myself humming it sometimes and the characters are great the movement control took a minute to get used to but it's not bad. This has to be one of the best mobile games I've ever played,5
it is very addicting but i love it.,5
"This is surprisingly good for a mobile game, good story too.",5
I can't update my game and I have enough storage.. HELP!,5
really addictive and fun,5
😁😁😁😁😁,5
good asf nuff said,5
"I like this game, it reminded me of zelda of old",5
I like it. The random character thing isnt great. but it plays fun and the character stories are cute.,4
"Midgardsormr is love, Brunhilda is life",5
Excellent Daoko jukebox with a slot machine attached. And I guess a decent action-RPG. Devs have been fairly reponsive to feedback; hope to see more updates in the future.,5
fun so far,5
"had my doubts to the style of the game. constantly managing your character movement and how responsive it might be, glad to say it works pretty well The free economy is also generous giving out free summons and currency for summons, doesn't feel like you are limited in what u don't get only woes is currently limited game modes and tedium to upgrades even with the QOL changes and ranking up to 5 stars is a chore",4
"Like most other gatcha games the drop rates on the good units are pretty low, requiring seriously good luck to pull the units you want. But thankfully cygames is extremely generous about giving out free pulls. Moreover, several groups in the community attempt to be inclusive of the less optimal units. Every change to date has improved the game for the player, and been focused on rewarding those who are willing to put in the effort (instead of money).",5
"this game is excellent, one MAJOR FLAW though. EVERY mission requires a download that takes a few MB of data. EVERY SINGLE MISSION. Beautifully made game Nintendo, but it uses too much memory.",2
Very fun and doesn't get very boring with all the content that keeps coming out steadily. Fluid. controls and great gameplay!,5
Very Addicting,5
would love to play this game as I have a lot of characters in it but it freezes so much and gives me black screens on loading. sometimes I can get into the game but every menu loads music then waits like 2-3 min before I see the screen,1
"Despite draw rates on 5 star characters which seems to be a problem with every gacha game this ones pretty fun. 10 folds SHOULD be given every event with as astronomically low the pull rates are and also because Wyrmprints, Heroes and Dragons get pulled from the same pool making it even harder.",5
i cant say bad words just in case kids reading but GET THIS FLIPPING GAME 👍👍👍👍,5
i like the rpg it great i love it,5
It's a really good game. While you can purchase upgrade items you can also just earn them by playing the game and participating in the in-game events that are held every other week.,5
"Great game, but too much downloading.",3
I cant even play the game. Keeps saying i need to update even though i just downloaded it. Ive tried uninstalling. Restarting my phone. Nothing. disappointing.,1
Really fun and addicting. :),5
"Great game, random summons are garbage. If the percentage was better on summons, it would be a better game. I still rate it a 5 because the mechanics and game play are still good.",5
great game love the Art work And story,5
App store allowed me to install but game said my device is not authorized to play the game.,1
This game is so addictive. Nintendo did a good job with this MOBA game,5
I played this game on release and thought it would be another complicated gacha game but on playing it more I know that now it's not the case...well a little bit but BECOMING A DRAGON was the big decision maker and the easy controls and game mechanics made it an addictive and fun game for me.,5
it's a really fun game,5
its a decent game and kinda cute.,4
addicted,5
funz,5
"fun, but gatcha feels really bad. wyrmprints will constantly block you from getting anything good",4
fanatical like a demon but beautiful like an angel,5
funn to play and gain characters on the way,5
amazing game that oozes polish and personality. every character is well written and their stories are all fantastic. the dev's are very active and generous to the community. the game is wonderful to experience,5
"A great, well made game! Very fun to play and I'm thoroughly impressed with the amount of work put in by the developers to make sure the game stays engaging and smooth.",5
Great chibi dungeon crawler game. Devs are always super on top of fixes and changes to the game. There's always something to do. Don't forget you can turn into a dragon!,5
"its an amazing game, its a must play for people who like to play this games genre.",5
Great game,5
"1st ring passing a game on my phone, never missed a date since launch to play. Highly addictive",5
too much space.,4
Get out your wallet because this games summon rates suck! Log in rewards are trash 10 days for a single summon?,1
Great gameplay and story. Freemium elments are non intrusive and not something i have needed once. Also no adds!!!,5
Nintendo has picked a winner here. a solid free to play that does not ask you to lay one cent to play. you can do everything for free or pay where you want to improve the rate at which you acquire upgrade materials(all which is not needed) great game and not a waste of your time.,5
Great co-op game for a moblie best played with friends,5
I truly love this game! Nintendo finally made a classic special for mobile!,5
A nice mix of cute and on point action RPG that works on mobile and a catchy song,5
Excellent game with a great story.,5
it pretty fun with nice story and something you can chill in bed and play,5
"Extremely Engaging! This game an actual FUN AND NON REPETITIVE gacha, you can play the ENTIRE game and not have to pay a single cent!!!! Content is not locked behind ridiculous timers &/or grinding of any kind. The characters ars not copy-paste-types from other typical styled games, and every characters story is interesting and gives them depth. The devs consistently listens to the feedback from reddit etc & ACTUALLY implements what players want. I dont have enough praise for this game!",5
"Press/hold, drag and tap in this ARPG. Team up or solo various storylines and events. Dragons come in multiple forms from stereotypical to humanoid and more. Great way to eat up a few minutes or an hour as you progress through chapters of storyline or events.",5
"Very fun and amazing game overall. Gameplay is great and co-op is very fun. Events are fun especially raid battle. For new players, they latest update has introduced a free 5* gacha tickect so newer players can start out with a 5*. Over all the developers for this game are very active and continuously introduce quality of life improvements aswell as fixes to any known glitch/bug.",5
"This game is really good for the Free to players, and with new things coming I can't wait for it.",5
It's a highly addicting game that I can lose many hours to.,5
Well paced rewards and challenging gameplay keep this game interesting.,5
"Overall a solid mobile game. Sound track is a tad bit unexpected and unique, but can be modified in the options.",5
I love this game and the way it plays,5
This game has great music. Cute characters and the UI design is amazing.,5
"First and foremost, Devs are very responsive to community feedback, which is really hard to find in gacha games. There are a lot of different goals to work towards. The ""skill"" based aspect of the game means you can make even the lowest rarity units viable, which is a HUGE plus for me since I prefer playing units because I like them rather than because they are ""OP."" Music and artwork are great as well. Gameplay is pretty fluid with minor flaws, and weapon types actually change fighting style.",5
why should i download every chapter,1
"at first i had a lot of fun playing this but the way you obtain adventures is broken and super luck based. i grinded months for the dark banner but when it came out i couldnt even get the 5 star. the event before as well, no luck at all. this game needs to make the experience better for people who try harded this game or its going to be dead in no time.",2
I have a lot of fun playing this with unique characters and intriquing story its definitely a game worth checking out.,5
too many confirmation windows... no real endgame or motivation to play...,4
High quality art and animation meets action RPG with gacha mechanics,4
very colorful and fun to play.,5
"I dont normally play mobile games, but this one is really fun in short bursts.",5
"Sub par writing. Too many downloads. I like the chibi style, but the fanservice art is off-putting.",2
This is a simple game that is easy to use & fun to play. level grinding & material grinding reccomended,5
Great game.,5
this game is fire,5
good game,4
The Daoko interactive experience,5
"a bit slow at times in terms of reacting but the condtant updates are good. i really like the character, jyst wishthere was a broader way to level many characters up.",4
"Great visual style, awesome music, decent rpg story, simple but deep mechanics.",5
it took to much data and it had no coler,1
Fun and engaging gameplay with plenty of customization for the characters and items! Decent headstart in the game for new players to jump into the game as well! The gacha experience appears to be typical although progress through the gate doesn't seem to rely excessively on it so far either!,5
Decent game compared to other gacha style games.,4
after I watched some reviews I had to try this game and so far I haven't regretted it.,5
"easy to use, at the beginning it kinda gets confusing. the only thing I don't like is how I always get duplicates out of the summoms",4
a new popular anime!,5
great game from Nintendo again. But those load times are killer,5
It is fun has easy to master controls and a great story,5
it's fun. IRS not something you'd take that seriously. combat is fun and I'd recommend to play to anyone for fun,5
There are plenty of trashy rate apps and this here is no exception. The chance of pulling anything good is like Winning the lotto and even the lotto win cant refund you. Not to mention they give terrible pulls while playing a soundtrack that would piss anyone off. Its like listening to inklings dance with a jonas brothers beat. This game needs to be erased from the playstore ASAP.,1
just wish there was more options for controls,5
It's a Wonderful game. Everything in it is amazing. but at 3.6 gigs and growing I soon won't be able to play it on my phone.,4
it good,5
it gurd,5
"Fun game/story but wouldn't recommend it yet until they fix auto play, communication with in game friends, a lot more content, and the amount of resources you need compared to what you get is the biggest problem in this game",2
Fun gatcha moneysinkness,5
"I enjoy the game a lot but after a short time the app has already reached 3.25GB on my phone. The gameplay is good, theres lots to do but the size and having to download so much for this game really kills it for me.",3
fun,5
It feels like a Nintendo game and also feels like a step above a mobile game too!,5
"I do not play a lot of mobile games simply because the free to play design makes it near impossible to enjoy unless I pay money. That is not the case with Dragalia Lost. I have not paid a dime because I do not feel the need to. It is a great game that since I downloaded it about 3-4 months ago I have only not booted it up 1 day. It's a great mobile game that does have typical free to play systems, however it comes with plenty of content and a great progression system that make paying not needed.",5
amazing boi,5
easily one of the best mobile games there is,5
"This is a decent free to play mobile game. Don't let the Nintendo brand fool you, it's just a normal mobile game. The performance was fine, but i'm on a pixel 3 xl, so I guess that's to be expected. I ran it with max graphics the whole time. Would probably be even better on a phone with more RAM to throw around. The story, is very simple (basically gather the 4 crystals...but instead of crystals, it's dragons.) The character development is about one step up from the original Final Fantasy, there is some dialog, but if you ask me in a month about each of the characters, i doubt i'd remember much about any of them. The action gameplay can be fun and is mostly polished. Swipe fast to dodge, tap to attack, hold for a different attack, special abilities with cooldowns, so on and so forth. Collecting is where this game shows it's strong mobile roots. The normal loot box mechanic to try to win a 4/5 star character/dragon/weapon/wyrmprint. Huge resource sink to upgrade stuff. You probably won't notice at first, because that's how these work, they shower you with resources early so it feels generous, but as you get deeper into the story and those ""first-time"" rewards start to dwindle, the push for real-money transactions becomes more noticible. You can make it through the main story pretty quick without pumping money into it, so i'd say it's worth it up until then. Don't let a blind loyalty to Big N make you think this is something special, it's a decent mobile game with very little that makes it stand out from the slew of other Free to play games.",3
a little too much exposition too early.,4
amazing,5
the game is fun but the grind pushes it to be pay to win. you don't earn enough resources to summon and upgrade without paying real money.,1
This is a game has a awesome story and sense of humor 😉😁. Nintendo thank you for this and continue to push for greatness.,5
surprisingly endearing,5
controls are easy enough and events have been plentiful. up until high levels you generally have a steady stream of gems to summon with. fun and kills time,5
"So far so good, it's a little too early in the gameplay to really tell, but i see promise.",4
This game is a blast. It's a bit overwhelming to start; but it's a really fun game.,5
While the gameplay itself is a neat twist on these sorts of games the controls are rather horrible. It's almost as if while trying to make the game have so many different gameplay characteristics they ended up having to settle for quantity over quality. Battling=problem #1 movement and attacks feel insanely clunky making the already repetitive areas even more painful and boring.The upgrading system gives too little information but way too much other junk. The music is implemented very nicely tho,2
unfair fights that force you to use your terrible AI teammates. not fun,1
"So far it's a lot of fun. doesnt seem super p2w, but I'm still early on.",5
i just downloaded this game. but all i get is an error and an unable to even log on to play the game.,1
Very fun game. Doesn't force you to pay any money and has loads of characters to choose from. Combat is simplistic yet fun. Only downside is the game size.,4
Surprisingly smooth and well put together. Mechanics are enjoyable and dont get tedious over time.,5
I think its aditictive astunding and deseves a check,5
wow Nintendo made one amazing game!!!,5
great graphics and so far very interesting story to keep me playing. also very easy learning curve,5
"Quite fun, and its not really pay to win 😍",5
unable to play due to flawed and defunct account creation system,1
The story is terrible. And you will have to fill your entire storage space before you get past the tutorial.,1
full of quality and fun,4
love it!,5
Game is great but the summon rate is really horrible,4
best phone game ever,5
so fun,5
This game is a really great mobile game. I love the story and how the music really does make the game better. But if you have a phone with low storage it might not be able to handle this game so take warning to that,5
Awesome game... i uninstalled it and then in less than an hour install it again.. surprise! lost my progress... can you help me!,1
is God feels like diablo lite,4
Entertaining and addicting,5
this game is perfect. named my character ibanishye because i thought it was funny. love that i dont have to spend money on this,5
Really fun game. I love the concept of this mobile action rpg.,4
"A fairly good move from the developers. I actually can't play but, I still recommend this game.",4
Great game. Easy controls. Very enjoyable.,5
really fun. still getting used to the gameplay,5
"I've been a huge nintendo fan for as long as I can remember. this game was a surprise to me, being a phone game. so far it's fun. a little complicated, and not enough tutorial, the movement takes some getting used to, but overall, I'm pleased with my experience so far.",5
Well created RPG. Surprising amount of thought and effort for a mobile gacha game.,5
not bad game dragon are cool looking,5
I looooooooooooooooooo😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve it!!!,5
really good game sometimes your thumb can get in the way of combat becuase of the way movement is handled.,4
pretty good,5
Had to change my review because the gacha system is terrible.,1
haven't been playing long but the game is fun,5
Really good RPG.,4
I love this game! I cant wait for the next chapter!,5
Updated review: Fantastic response from the developers of this app when it comes to bug issues. Still FTP friendly which I liked and they are very generous with gifts with this game. The only thing I don't like is it's very hard to level up 4 star to 5 because the amount of eldwater obtained in this game is too small since 4 star to 5 is expensive. Not to mention you also need eldwater in the final mana circle. It would be nice to see lower cost needed for level up or higher # of eldwater given.,4
amazing cinematic story. fun gameplay. seems f2p friendly so far.,5
super fun!!,5
really good storyline,5
whats up with the appearance rates... why are they ridiculously low lol... when i tenfold summon the only thing i ever get are mini dragons andb3 stars and rarely any adventurers... cmon now lets be fair..,2
Hooked me with Nintendo. Very interactive & customizable. Absolutely love my Kingdom & Dragons!,5
"definitely in my top 5 best mobile rpg games. I picked it up days ago, and i cant put it down, its that good 😁",5
"I reviewed this when it first launched and felt after that time that the game has improved. The gameplay is still smooth and the story is okay, but what really stood out were the developers Cygames. They respond very well to feedback and constantly give a heads up to what they are planning for the future and have given a lot of free 10 roll tickets too. They are the best mobile game developer in my opinion.",5
Love this game.,5
i dont know i just find it fun,5
Fun time killer!,5
dont understand why you have to doenload every mission,3
It is a awesome game just wish the controls were a bit better.,5
"Most rewarding game experience I have ever had on a mobile game, 10/10, a must play!",5
"Beautiful design always been a fan of Cygames! Music is a plus, goid way of keeping you in the game! very easy to use interface!",5
"The storyline is great. This game Brings RPG style games into the mobile universe, I like the controls but would prefer more traditional controls such as basic arrow buttons but that's my choice. All in al a very good rpg for phones",5
"way too many downloads and menus. the game was constantly asking me to add random people to my friends list. there is 1 minute of gameplay followed by 10 minutes of boring menus, downloads, and tutorialized in app purchases. it's too bad because the little bit of gameplay there is is actually fun.",1
Cygames usually impresses with it's graphics and gameplay.,5
it's almost like I'm playing on the Nintendo switch,5
"Have been playing since Oct. 2018 and the music never gets old. It's amazing how there's probably over 100 characters and everyone has their own unique story and moveset. So much passion and effort goes into this game weekly and it shows. There's communication between the players and developers and events one after the other. I don't feel pressured to spend money on this game, but I do anyway simply because they deserve as much support as I can give to express my gratitude for such a good game..",5
"i love this game!! Even tho its just tiny it's still probably my favorite rpg? like not even just for mobile but in general. i love the artwork and the way it's animated, i love the characters and their storylines, gameplay and battle makes perfect sense, and being able to turn into a variety of dragons AND use ur cool adventurers is super fun!!",5
"Just an amazing game so far im loving it, every element of gameplay a truly wonderful dessing and awesome graphics, gameplay and gorgeous carachters, just gotta love it 5 stars.",5
great,5
love this game. yea it's energy based but they hook you up with stuff right off the bat and it's better then the last 12 games I've tried and uninstalled,5
Nice game but costly gambling practices.,3
Great game feel in love from the jump,5
"This game is pretty interesting. It has good moment to moment play, but navigating menus and learning is kinda confusing. There is a lot going on in this game. Pretty fun so far.",4
great game,5
Awesome game,5
Cool game,5
Edit: it got a lot better with how its presented and what you need to do in order to get through areas without being utterly annihilated.,5
"been playing mobile RPGs for a while, this one does balance the game pretty well. RNG is rare but not nonexistent, and the team setup and gameplay is interactive, I'm glad it's not turn based.",5
"I love this game, just please bring back the 2nd Home screen song!",4
The game fixes issues right away and a great community. Also best music out of any hero collector!,5
just amazing!!!!!,5
a really good mobile game.,5
super cute game :),5
this game is so much fun to play I keep wanting to play more :>,5
love the game but i think Nintendo should make a star fox adventures on android ios 3ds and switch that would be a hit,5
great game love the story and gameplay,5
The game itself is exhilirating and keeps you on the edge with intense storyline and lovable characters. It is a must play for any role-play gamer.,5
THIS IS A AMAZING GAME! GREAT GRAPHICS AND STORYLINE!👍👌,5
awesome...thought my phone was a gameboy for a sec,5
"Splits gacha pool 3-ways with cards, units, and dragons. Terrible idea that is very anti-consumer. Worse than FGO's gacha. Even with the higher generosity in free roll/premium currency the rates are too in-favor of the game, not the player.",1
Fun and with an engaging story!,5
good game,4
"Developers do care about the fanbase which is good to see. In a very expensive gacha game, they recently been generous and have given players alot of free stuff. The game itself is fun and enjoyable. Co-op experience is nice although has minor flaws.",4
"the game is amazing, but the only thing holding me back from a five star is the additional downloads after every stage.",4
"Very cool, straight foward gameplay. The menus, however, are impossible to parse.",5
"very good story, not pay to win as i thought it be, very much a tales type game",5
it was one of the greatest things in my life,5
Little glitchy on tablet and kinda chuggs along but works fine on my phone. Cute character designs but its a shame how a lot of dragons are just palette swaps,3
excellent gameplay with professional voice acting and cut scenes. A mobile game that actually feels like a console game.,5
good game great control but to short,5
smooth and clean game nice 👌,5
fun and simple,4
"honestly, very bland. the story and characters are very average, nothing special. the gacha system isn't bad, but i loathe the chibi graphics.",3
Huge game! need wifi and a lots of extra space...like....2GB. Other than that amazing production value.,4
"Really enjoying the graphics, music, and story so far. Pretty advanced for a mobile game!",5
awesome thanks for the great game,5
Right off the bat failed to connect to server after an abnormally long white screen boot up.,5
"I enjoy the playstyle and the upgrades, I would like to be able to download entire stories at a time instead of each individual chapter.",4
Very cute and fun. Loving the characters and music so far.,4
"pulled 12,000 wyrmite and 4 tenfold summon tickets and got nothing but 5☆ wyrmprints pulled 1,500 wyrimite and got 3 5☆adventurers 10/10 would gacha again",5
Game is really fun!,5
yeah,5
"One of the best mobile games I've played! The storyline is very engaging, the controls are easy. There are plenty of things to keep you occupied for hours on end, I just started playing today so I don't even have everything unlocked yet, but I can only imagine just how im depth this game gets seeing as it's already got me hooked.. If you are looking for a game as close to a console feel as you can get on mobile play this game. it won't disappoint.",5
it is amazing,5
"I waited to play this game for a bit...it has been worth it. If you haven't downloaded and played yet.. you're an idiot..hurry up, make room on your device and get to it",5
ITS AMAZING THE GRAPHICS AND 3D MODE ARE SO COOL I WOULD KILL TO PLAY THIS GAME TBH THIS IS THE BEST RPG STORY MODE TYPE GAME THE STORYLINE IS THE BEST THING ABOUT IT (5 STAR GUARRANTEED),5
"I'm pretty early in the game at this point but so far this is my favroite mobile game. For one it actually feels like a game not a time waster, which have their places, but when thats ALL that exists its rephreshing to see something that combines real gamplay on top of its dokkan/fire emblem heros style summoning and training mechanics. My only complaints that I hope improves as I play is that there way to many visual novel style exposition dumps which I would like to see a lot less of.",5
I decided to reset my phone backed up my files. Been playing since the game came out. only to find out that if you don't link it to a nintendo account. Its absolutely pointless. have had to download everything again only to discover the last year of game play I put it was erased completely. great way to waste time.,1
It's a really cool game but I can't figure out how to make the characters not blacked out,5
too early to tell but i have a good feeling abkut this game will come back and change if it sucks,5
"Played less than a day but already love the game, great graphics and smooth gameplay!",5
"pretty awesome game. simple controls that arent boring and the gacha is pretty nice. edit, way to big. download size is rediculous.",1
I love playing this game a lot. you can play casually and also grind. Raid battles are really fun to play with friends and provide a nice challenge. not to mention the production value of this game is exceedingly well.,5
it's pretty fun. I like a lot about this game.,5
Google play achievements aren't being triggered. The game is amazing however. Just really like my achievements.,3
Really good and a little addictive but could run smoother on my tablet and could have more voice acting during the non-animated cutscenes.,4
"it really sucks seeing 2 5☆ and then realising you got double wyrmprinted, but that is the gacha life, and cygames provides compensation in the form of 10-summon vouchers and plenty of wyrmite (as long you exercise discipline). it isn't p2w; you can clear most content with adventurers/dragons found in the lower pools. what i dislike is the amount of space it takes up on my device, but overall the devs are nice and the gameplay is also fun (though a tad laggy). so yeah! really nice game.",4
great game.but the constant downloading is annoying.,4
fun game but needs controller support. playing touchscreen with your fingers blocking half the screen is a no go.,1
Good game even if you have never played this type of play style .,4
very addicting and fun,5
It's a awesome game but I just made a purchase for the lucky hanetsuki paddle pack and I didn't receive it. just checked my bank and it seems I have been charged. I need the pack or my money back. Just tried making a request through email with a picture of the receipt but it wouldn't go through. That's why this dropped from a 4 star to a 2 star.,2
I absolutely love it... My only question is will older events return so that those of us who didn't know about the game until after they were concluded can get the characters featured in them?,5
"Fun, but runs a bit slow on my phone.",4
"Incredible music and really colorful, fun graphics. Instantly addicted!",5
Amazing,5
"The game is addicting, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is great. Highly recommended.",5
tiz one of the best nintendo games i've played,5
this game is so good,5
"THIS GAME IS PHENOMENAL. It honestly has alot of charm, and the music is really good. The community is really great and supportive too.",5
"No game is perfect but this game tries it's best to be, a very reactive dev group that makes sure to respond properly to their fan base. Taking note of how people feel about features in the game and changing them for the better. This will not be everyone's cup of tea but for those who like the game style you will surely not be dissappointed.",4
hard tap optional. First time bless get four rainbow summon,4
super fun for a phone game constantly downloading can suck but fun game,5
I love it.,5
an excellent example of how mobile games should be.,5
"I've tried multiple times to play this game, and every time I try to download the additional data, I get a connection error. If it was possible to give this game zero stars, I would.",1
"Half the time the game fails to connect to the server, the other half of the time I'm reminded I can't enjoy collecting characters without spending large sums of money. The gacha system is broken beyond belief. Don't waste time with this game.",1
This game is awesome. The only negative is that you have to download a lot of data + download to play every chapter. That is a lot of space. Ugh,3
i like it alot the only thing is that the controls are a bit wierd. sometimes ill move but the character wont go anywhere. other than that its awesome.,5
"Disconcerting. The game has an almost 2 gig download just to start the game, with every episode and chapter after being another chip at your mbs. This seems like Nintendo just decided to make a mobile game that will for you to pay out for a 32 gig sim card and any extra ingame winnings. Horrible.",1
"I enjoy the music and the gameplay is interesting, but there's probably a required download every 1-2 quests. I get there's a lot of stuff going on, but going to go ahead and uninstall due to the inconvenience and annoyance. Didn't get too far into this game before getting over this.",3
one of the best games on mobile ;) one we really play not just auto and forget,5
good,4
They just want your money.,1
"A lot of fun, interesting storyline, visually and musically pleasing, and convenient to play in short or long bursts. Co-Op is a nice feature, too!",5
pretty great game but it is from nintendo...so what else is new love it.,5
"Its really fun, with lots of content to go through. You can enjoy a worthwhile experience from this game whenever you're bored.",5
"highly addictive and very fun. Honestly I was very sceptical at first thingking it was just gonna be another turn based rpg on the pile we have, but has turned out be a a very engaging game with fun characters, great gameplay, and a clean UI. Highly recomend",5
Fun and addicting,5
"8/10, solid presentation, interesting dragon mechanic, would play again",4
"Nintendo did it again in creating a new fun world to explore, never before has a mobile game could get this addicting.",5
dull. very boring and uneventful,2
I love this game,5
The gameplay is great music is wonderful,5
"great story! I love character improvement, and 3d models are cute",5
"This game makes me lose faith in humanity. If you don't hate video games, give Dragalia Lost a try. It might just change your mind.",2
Best game I ever played.,5
Simply love it. Don't have to put one dime into playing it to get good stuff!,5
fun game,5
good gam sew far lik dis,4
the game is fun the drop rates for heroes r not I have done 20 10 pulls and have not got any 5 star hero from a pull yet,1
so far it seems fun,4
love the story and gameplay. especially the story.,5
Gameplay is solid but i don't play anymore because I don't enjoy getting nearly 8 wyrmprints after every multi. Wyrmprints need to be in their own banner.,2
great game,5
great game,5
Absolutely Incredible,5
"Liked it. Nintendo just knows how to make story games interesting. It's expected they do as the company has been going this long and this suscessful. Do reccommend. My favorite character is Ranzal, I enjoy that good loving merc after that one snippet between the protagonist and him at that bar. The snippets have a habit of making me fall in love with the characters more then I realized they could. Overall good game to try out.",5
I got this game because Cygames does an amazing job on on their franchises and I havent been disappointed~,5
I am a soldier,4
so far so good,5
"Nintendo wins again, another great rpg!",5
Amazing,5
"downloading user review (0.8GB) This game downloads each level right before you launch it, which would be fine if i could predownload, download while the game is inactive or if it wasn't every freaking level. As a result, the gameplay feels a lot like just stareing at a loading screen. gameplay was fun too much load time requires WiFi (or an unlimited data plan) you spend a lot of time looking at a downloading screen, before each level",1
"This is a fun tap and slasher, the story and voice acting made it pop compared to a lot of similar games. Where I became disappointed was during a recent summon purchase. I had 1 5 star character and spent 25 dollars to purchase another. When I received the exact same character (7% chance) Customer Service left me out to dry. Surprisingly disappointing customer service from a typically great company. I will no longer be playing.",2
pretty good,5
"it's a really fun, top-down, dungeon crawling, action RPG, with a functional combat system. What more could you ask for?",4
Amazing quality and polish for a mobile game. This would of been a DS release a few years back.,5
"Takes a while to get used to the controls, other than that game is awesome.",4
Absolutely horrible game. The only way to play is by buying overpriced packs that literally give you the best 5 star items in the game. I would never recommend this to anyone I care about. Do NOT waste your time with this Nintendo cash grab con.,1
Laggy on s7 and I'm not sure why... Even I low settings. Looks good though and it is your average breath of fire game in a nutshell.,3
"Unfortunately it's no where close to Nintendo quality. There are a number of issues that keep the game from running smoothly. Lack of full screen options, huge game forced to store locally (needs sd card support)",3
"its fun game atm, aim control abit sluggish combine with the animation but it still playable and u can get used to it after a while.",5
Describe your experience.,3
cool game,5
"would love it on Switch, but its a really fun game even on phones",5
I have to say that this my favorite mobile game ever.,5
The game is great and all but the rates to pull ANY five star are WAY too low for starting off. without proper things for the campaign it's nearly impossible to do anything. It took me 7500 Wyrmite to even get a 5* and I've farmed every single wyrmite available. and I've only gotten 2 5*s out of maybe.... 18000 wyrmite or something like that? like please increase the rates. it's too frustrating to do anything with such terrible rates.,3
"Considering the options, this one is one of the better games I have installed. Yes, theres an in-game store, but so far it's been completely avoidable. Graphics are great, story so far is pretty good, Kpop themed music is actually enjoyable to me. the only issue I have are the controls, and the small DLs between every mission but I admit I haven't played with the settings yet. Runs great on Galaxy S8+.",4
"Fun, addictive game",5
great story and game mechanics,5
"This game has been amazing so far! No idea why I didn't know it existed until a little while ago... ah well, I definitely recommend!!",5
"Pleasant atmosphere, great game, but stingy gatcha.",4
"It was fun at first, artwork was amazing, and characters were cool, too, but the game itself was too easy.",2
woot! ima dragon!,5
"I like the idea and the way the game plays. However, why do I need to download each level when I get to them?",4
"this game is very fun. yes it has in app purchase, how else are they going to make money through a free app. but no ads!!!",5
I really enjoy the story! the controls could use a but more tweaking but everything else is fantastic!,5
"Fun, kind of a dungeon crawl type. Would be better if they removed stage select and made it open world, or longer stages at least. Honestly 4 stars, giving 5 for effort.",5
really enjoying it so far,4
not bad. pretty enjoyable,4
"Fun to play, easy to understand, and decent drop rate",5
This game is very cool. I love all the classic elements of RPG's in this game. So very very good.,5
cooooooool!,5
so far I have had a blast. this game is visually beautiful and runs well. the constant download screens were annoying at first but I quickly took care of that problem by downloading the batch. so far so good.,5
great game,5
Very addicting. I'm not a fan on mobile games but this has really changed my mine.,5
it's a relatively good game so I've heard and I'm willing to give it a chance even though I'm not much of an rpg type of guy,3
i hope its offline!!!!!,5
"Seriously great game with generous devs. It's a gacha game though, and the rates for pulls aren't amazing, but the polish is still off the charts for a mobile game. Voice acting for all characters and story for all of them, with a great localization team really helps make me feel invested in the story. Gameplay is solid too, simple enough to idly play at work, but also has difficult content that keeps me on my toes when I want a challenge too. Easily my favorite mobile game out there.",5
"One word, Extraordinary this game is wow, not like any other generic rpg mobile game. This is how hood the game is, i would literally have fun just sitting on the home acreen for a good 30minutes bobbing my head to the music and the rythme to the characters. dowbload it, trust me its worth your time.",5
fun but i wish it was more challenging. its a bulky game so your phone needs some horsepower to run it well,4
The game play is GREAT! Graphics are equally so. Everything about the game is smooth and well designed! I definitely recommend this one!,5
Best. Story. Ever. (Chapter 5),5
very nice,5
This game is really fun i say this is five star but this is for nintendo:Hey nintendo i like your games but if you want to you should make a phone kirby game im sure it will be super fun,5
its a fun game. They are giving it their all to help the playerbase,5
"fun, amazing, great graphics",5
Great game! I like this a lot!,5
A well made game with gameplay that significantly distinguishes it from all the other mobile games out there.,5
it is so great. takes up a heck of a lot of data but absolutely worth it!!!,5
"would have been 5☆ but for reasons unknown, my month of game time was lost... great game otherwise.",2
super Fun and enjoyable!,4
"I like the game, it reminds me of Rune Story that was since cancelled. The controls are easy to use and the story and characters are very likeable. The only thing I have is that the drop rates as always meh with these games. But loving the game and the features it comes with.",4
THE BEST GAME,5
Great game continues making improvements love it and it keeps one hooked with the constant events and the optional multiplayer,5
Can't play the game it just constantly wants to download more data at this point it was over 3 gigs downloaded and it wanted to download another 1.3 gigs before even playing,1
"very intuitive battle system, aaa design",5
awesome and truly an engaging gaming experience. however the only thing I dislike about the game is that you have to download every chapter that you are going to quest in.,5
"Dragalia Lost is by far the best mobile game to come out in a long time. The developers are extremely generous, pulling 5* Adventurers/Dragons are easy to get and always in rotation after events, and requires no money to get ahead at all. Those who are dropping one-star reviews either have had connection issues--which are not the game's fault--or whining because they didn't get what they wanted handed to them and are too salty to be patient. Cygames listens to their playerbase, and it shows.",5
"I've been playing this for a few months now and am still loving it. This gatcha is generous when it comes to new content, characters and events. I appreciate the fact that when there is an error they own up to it and theres always a gift! The most generous gatcha game I've ever played. :3",5
The story is a little predictable but overall good. What ruins it for me is the summoning. I bought a welcome pack when I had one 5☆ character and i received the same 5☆ char from the summoning. when I pay $25 to get a guaranteed 5☆char I expect to get a different one. The summoning is so bad in this game. People in the game will leave the room in co-op if you do not have strong enough char but you cant upgrade them if you dont pay $ for packs if you were able to get a decent char to begin with.,1
I have been playing the game since day one. No regrets!,5
"my phone broke and because I couldn't make a Nintendo acct due to the website not allowing me to, I lost all my data and devs went help.",3
pretty dope :),5
"Boring. Too many download/loading screens. Slow pace. Too much story, too few playing time. Too much upgrade and extra stuff.",2
"I can't actually play the game. I download the app, and then it tells me I have to download another half gigabyte of stuff before I can do anything, and apparently I have to leave the game running to download? And it there is no way to pause a download either? So after half an hour of my phone being on and looping animation, I have the thing at 30%, even on wifi, and I get a phone call that apparently cancels the download. So this game is unplayable.",1
"P2w and definitely a gacha game, but so much fun and so generous. I look forward to the events the most 🎉",5
"Great game ,good game play, love the dragons.",5
Fun game kinda hard to play with one hand but I'll get used to it. Overall no complaints,5
a 10/10 keep up the great work!,5
very fun game only downside it you have to download each mission but besides that its very fun,4
A friend recommended this to me. It takes a while to load and takes up a lot of memory but it's fun and has great music.,4
really addictive game not just another tap game you actually feel like youre playing so far its great.,5
"Controls are easy, gameplay is great, and the storyline is amazing.",5
fun!,5
Decent enough to keep my interest. voice acting is solid for the most chunk. Swapping between dragon form and the various characters is actually a pretty fun mechanic!,4
great,5
"Beautiful models, great transitions between 3D and 2D cutscenes, everybody is voice-acted, but my only concern is that the audio during cutscenes and especially 3D cutscenes is displaced you'll hear it before you see the words on screen and then it takes forever for the game to catch up to that",5
very fun. good way to kill time. it does lag though,5
Awesome,5
"I installed the game again since I got a new phone. Ver 1.3.0 specifically, and its telling me to update to the latest which again, I already did. What gives?",3
Great!! Really love the game. Feels like most 30 dollars games today. Especially nice one the big screen with a contoller.,5
I like the gacha aspect a lot but the real kicker is the gameplay which differs from most other gachas I've played.,4
pretty fun rpg. excellent production values and user interface. very generous with rewards and don't shove cash items in your face.,5
Honestly pretty good as far as gotcha games go.,4
I love this game,5
love this game,5
fun little game. easy to learn and its nintendo so should have decent support.,4
great graphics and gameplay. lots of freebies,5
"Personally I think it's one of the best gacha games out there! Art is adorable, nice UI with a lot of cute touches, cute character interactions, great music, good English script. It has an actual action battle system and also autoplay to take some of the grind out. While total available units is small in comparison to other games, they release 3 units and a dragon every 2 weeks, so it's only a matter of time. So far friendly for f2p or dolphins with pretty good rates compared to other gachas.",5
its good for dolphins and ok for f2p,4
nice,5
"time consuming so, if you've got one of those boring jobs this will help the day go by",5
Fun game,4
i love the game because vincent tong is Eudens voice actor and he also is the voice actor for touta matsuda 😁😁,5
Good RPG very heavy story so beware of that.,4
amazing gameplay; quality story; many ways to progress without spending money,5
"Playing for just a day, but enjoyable so far.",5
fun graphics and gameplay,5
fun action rpg with cool dragon transformation gameplay. how could you not love this?,5
the best,5
i love this game! the graphics are good and the characters are so cute! i personally think u should make an anime out of this based on the story in the game!,5
tis good,5
really fun,4
"The game is a lot of fun, generous with its free currency, and attentive to issues. Gacha mechanics are not my favorite but so far its been good with them.",5
This game has a really good storyline to it and the music is awesome,5
The Vocals for this game as an unique feeling for this game elevates it to a level of it's in which none can touch. I enjoy this game with a passion and how enthralling this game is with the background singing; gameplay and story. I feel it will be hard to put down and very enthusiastic to enjoy.,5
great so far,5
Very good graphics and a compelling story line. I really enjoy the game. The characters are adorable.,5
storys good,5
"Fantastic gameplay, story, graphics and lots of fun!",5
"I enjoy playing game's like this on the phone, the gameplay is simple and easy, the graphics are clean and play's smoothly, the game remind's me of king's knight a tad bit. over all the game is really fun and a great past time, it's a must try for people looking for an experience. Don't knock it ti'll you try it. 👍",4
fun and they dont shove the micro transactions in your fave also the rng doesnt seem to unfair,5
very kawaii and fun. can get through the game without having to pay to play.,5
Fun game,5
I wanna attack in the direction I tap,4
"I signed up for this game as a pre order, and have had alot of fun with it so far. i like that you dont feel you need to pay to progress, the story is good and the artwork is fantastic.",5
"The art and and music were amazing But everything else is meh. Bad gacha rates and such a grindy game. This is literally granblue fantasy not to mention its controls. If you're into millions of hours of grinding, this is the game for you. Otherwise No thanks, bye.",1
family fun and a great story. I would recommend if you love Nintendo and love jrpg games.,5
better than heroes skKSDJDKH I love it,5
"Play by creating or signing on to an Nintendo account, or you will lose your record of progress when you switch phones or uninstall/re-install. Google or Facebook sign in will NOT save your progress. I lost my progress when I got a new phone. Now I am not playing anymore.",3
i love it,5
Tutorial is a bit long with multiple steps but otherwise a good mobile game.,4
Wonderful Game So far 5 star ticket.,5
"Very easy to learn to play, beautiful game graphics, and its overall fun! Very addicting indeed. And since it's super interactive, you aren't bored 😍💌❣💟",5
great,5
"really well made, its apparent that alot or care was taken into making this game, then again with a Company like Nintendo making it its expected to be high quality as it is, nontheless good job",5
cool game *sleeps*,5
good game,5
Euden for Smash.,5
its fun but the game is reaching ober 4 gigs thats insane man really i cannot play any more untill tou try and limit the size of the game i have tried saying that bit yoy do not care and i thought you ninyendo would like to make the game accesable to all not to people who can afford sd cards and high storage phones,1
Best gatcha game I've ever played. They are normally a waste of time and money.,4
I cant even get into the game! every time i try it freezes up at the starting screen!,1
Great game,5
Great game and addictive,5
absolutely love the app. but please make full screen to the new screen aspect ratio. especially for the pixel 3 xl. thank you.,4
"Pretty good so far, the graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is a solid hack n slash experience. My only issue is with Stamina based games. That being said, I only the play the game in 10-15 minute intervals, so it's not really much of an issue.",4
its an amazing game if i could actually play it and the server was actually working and not saying failed to connect to server everytime i logged on,4
Love it,5
Fun game,5
pretty fun but long download,5
awesome,5
"cancerous gacha. stay away if you don't want salt from gacha pulls. it'll happen soon enough when you have a unit you like that's limited on the banner, rabbit hole is deep and salty. don't download it you don't want to be salted all over",1
"awesome, fun and a great throwback feel I love it",5
solid game,5
I like it but there is one problem. Some stuff won't load,4
"Very grindy in every system in this game, nothing is free or extra hard to get by. Not the best control system ever, just newer in a way. Battle comes in 3 favours, you either do one of the following. 1. attacking 2. dodging 3. missed by a mile and last, boss battle have way too many AoE which is deadly to melee char. Bosses are too op imo unless you spend money to power up your party or else death/lose the dungeon run almost every map point. Seemingly every turn are designed to slow or stop u",2
is a really good game,5
"Its a big game, space wise and time sink wise. but its well done and alot of fun.",5
"Really solid game, great graphics. Feels like a game rather than a cash grab.",5
awesomeness,5
pretty cool,5
"The game is decent but unfinished. Lots of us have been waiting quite awhile for more of the story and were disappointed to see our long wait was rewarded with just one more chapter you can complete in under an hour. Everything in this game is short. The story is short, the dungeons are short, the events are short. The only thing not short is the grind... unless you pay.",4
awesome addictive game,4
so been playong about a week put about 75 dollars into the shop and the recent update deleted my data so i contact support and firgure no big deal there a mean to recover to find out that unless i had linked my nitendo accout there is not so now im out the money and time because i didnt want to be spammed by nitendo emails...... dont pay into thos game even signing up does not gaurntee this wont happen to you and the will not restore under any cicumstances.,1
A super fun game this is.,5
"great art, stunningly bad gacha rates. totally skippable game overall.",1
Great game. Terrific support. Any problems are always addressed by the developers and fixed.,5
best arpg I've ever played on mobile.,5
The best phone game I've ever played. Perfectly blends the best of almost every popular phone game genre.,5
fantastic game wow,5
Loads of fun. Very nice real time action adventure RPG gacha. The art style is catchy and welcoming. Very nice Kemono style dragons. Only gets better,5
It's a awesome game thanks Nintendo for another awesome game,5
good graphics and great time killer,5
so far so good. having occasional kuck to android home screen while playing on my tablet. android phone no issues. sometimes have to play on the phone to do things int the castle.,5
excellent,5
Great game,5
Awesome game! I usually have a hard time getting into mobile games but this one sucked me in!,5
its fun,5
Concept is great but the amount of memory it requires for each stage is ridiculous. Uninstalling!,3
"Updating my review to 5 stars because this game truly deserves it. The developers are extremely generous, the story is interesting, and there is always something to do. The game is constantly being improved and there's content for all players, whether they play the game casually or frequently.",5
I like this game in honestly. It explains things well and the gameplay is quite fun! I know the gacha mechanic are a big turn off to some people but really you can play this game without doing it. It's easy enough with 3 to 4 star characters. The big issue I have now with it is that I cant play co-op unless I want to face an infinite loading screen. Nintendo should really fix that since its supposed to be one of their strong suits when promoting this game,4
"It's certainly not fantastic, but it's still very fluid & refreshing to play. One of the best phone games I've played.",5
fun addicting,5
decent game to help pass time,4
It's pretty cool but the controls aren't fluid enough for my taste. But no game is perfect and besides that it's really fun. the 3D graphics are a bit meh but it's ok. I really like the story line too. And the way all the characters have specific personalities that never break.,5
"I see all these games on the play store and I never know if it's worth the time but this one I found because I was looking for Nintendo games on the play store didn't expect to find any but this came up and it's like nintendos zelda and blizzards Diablo had a baby. To sum it up its worth getting into so you can ignore all the ""spam"" games if they don't appeal to you.",5
"Why the Christ can you get dupes of 5 star adventurers when you only have one? And the amount of water you get for dupes is a grand joke. 3000 isn't even a third of what you need for unit advancement. The game is not even light payer friendly, let alone freemium. Good luck making any real progress in this title. It'll drop to sub 4 stars soon enough with its recent cash grab events.",1
The money you spend to summon isnt worth the poor success rate. Don't let your first 1 or 2 fool you.,1
Its as cool as the breeze Daddy-O,5
Fun game!,5
"Great game! Immersive Story, easy to play and level up. You dont have to pay to be competitive! Lots of Characters to choose from and team up with, stop reading these reviews and download now!!!",5
"Good game, thought it can be a bit hard to read on smaller devices. Works great on Android tablets, though!",4
Delete Wyrmprints,5
It's a cute game! The music is great reminds me of zenonia. I think that's how you spell that 😂,5
It a good game,5
good game,4
Great game but the app is MASSIVE. I'm continuously having to delete other games to make room for their constant updates.,2
this is so much like so many other games its utterly useless to play it..the story is so.....predictable and shows no variation....things take too many twists to fast and it completely breaks the cycle...,1
I think it's awesome I thought at first it's just a boring game but it's so fun playing it is like a whole new version of video gaming I'm so sorry I can't play it every day but I try because it deserves it and also a five star rating.,5
nice,5
Great campaign and the reoccurring events that have me anticipating new content!,4
Man i love the store for dragalia along with the unique characters its has. Only thing I can find wrong with it is some of the updates happen to frequently.,5
Seems funny. Follows the same classic 1-5* summon mechanic as all the other similar games on the app store but does so well and seems reasonable as far as rewards for a free to play player.,4
"update: Previous rating verified and justified...after spending some hard earned real dollars i have managed to collect an untold amount of big-time scrub arse 3 star characters, dragons and wyrmprints...easily among the WORST summon rates i have ever witnessed...PITIFUL! Sorry but after playing for week I have to say that the Devs are pitiful...until they actually remedy their atrocious controls and adjust their dismal summon rates this game will only deserve 1 star...",1
"it fails to authenticate and won't load the rest of the way , and still won't. way a rip. I spent prolly close to 40$ in app purchases now it doesn't load.",1
highly addictive in the best way possible!!!,5
Fun game about dragons and dungeon crawling,5
"Enjoyed the app so I linked my account the first day the app released. Phone broke and had to get a new one, when I relinked the game started me on a brand new acct. Contacted support and as I figured they were unable to assist. No bad feelings from them but it's unfortunate the app link failed on their end as I have the original confirmation email from Nintendo for linking. If you want to play and link your account, log into Nintendo to check because the game developers will not be able to help.",2
"Real time action rpg, with live coop. Cygames is great, and this game is on it's way to become one of the best on the market. Get in early!",5
"I really enjoyed this game. fun game play and charming characters. I do not like the gacha system but this game is so generous to offer a lot of items for upgrading heros and weapons. That said, it is worth playing.",5
I'm really liking this game I like dragons and this game really came out to me. but a problem is how much stuff you have to download. but I still think you should try this game.,5
This game is definitely my favorite game besides smash ultimate but its one of the top games on my list.,5
"Definitely worth a try if you like a Fire Emblem story. The tap controls are a bit annoying at times but not unplayable. Graphics are good looking. One complaint is that I have two devices and device #2 kept saying ""authentication failed"" and I had to uninstall. In addition if you have a rooted device the game will be ""nOt AuThOrIzEd"" and this includes Android emulators. Frankly this kind of sucks.",5
this is a excellent game I really love it,5
Super fun and fair game,5
"I rarely play mobile games and even more so review them but Dragalia Lost is an exception. With consistent playing you are rewarded with pretty much anything to take you to the highest levels of play without spending a dime. Generous rewards and events keep you chock full of premoum currency to keep up, and the devs are pumping new content all the time. Great game.",5
great all around game,5
good game,5
"Dragalia Lost brings the JRPG to mobile, a charming game with a deeply likeable and expansive cast, beautiful art, astounding music, and a supportive dev team. Yes it has a gacha, but if you dont like gachas you absolutely do not have to use it, F2P is not a handicap at all! A relaxed or infrequent playstyle will not bar you from events or content, grinding is self-inflicted not a mandatory game requirement. My only complaint is that I really wish it was a full console game!",5
amazing game!!,5
great game,5
Currently it is a fun game and I would love to support the game however there seems to be a bug that prevents some folks from purchasing items saying you have an incomplete purchase even if one has not purchased anything before. Support has been less than stellar in this manner and I will gladly change my rating once this issue is addressed.,5
"I love the music in this game. Its catchy and upbeat and I gind myself hummingit often. Plenty of events and each charectors, dragons, and even the castle has there own unique backstories. Am i addicted probably but it just goes to show how much i enjoy this game. In game rewards arent bad either.",5
"Thank you Nintendo, very cool! I'm absolutely addicted to this game, but, it takes up a lot of space. I had to delete all my photos off my phone and 92% of my other apps. You have to be very dedicated to this game if your going to get it. But, it's definitely worth it, so I recommend it!!",4
"Excellent game but I can't play it! ""Your device isn't compatible"" on OnePlus 5 with latest OxygenOS. Would be 5* if i could actually play...",1
most generous gapcha ever,5
"Just got the special ten summons pack and got a 5 star Jeanne, but when I checked my inventory she's not in there. so basically I didnt receive her for some reason. Obvious major bug and please fix. And also I want my Jeanne please.",1
if you are looking for some fast paced RPG fun thid is the game for you. co-op and solo either way is a ton of fun.,5
grindy game but good content,5
boring time killer dair gacha system,5
best game evurrrrr,5
takes to long to down load,2
A free to play game that finally respects your time and money. Even if you don't spend money you can get a lot of fun and do not feel like you are missing out.,5
"Dope! This game is so good it plays itself, lol!",5
"Love everything about it, F2P friendly",5
its guud.,5
"finally, something worth giving attention to..",5
very very fun to play,5
love it,5
Would be better if it was a Zelda game.,5
yes,5
"Fantastic and very fun! The Cherry on top is I'd say this game uses the least amount of predatory tactics I've ever seen in a mobile game, let alone a gacha game. I only spend money on this game because I want to support the developers, I would very easily be able to never spend a dime on it and be able to complete the same amount of content as someone who spends money on it.",5
Definitely what I would expect from Nintendo and Cygames. Great game.,5
I dunno. It's alright. But kinda repetitive and all the events feel the same even though they are somewhat different. I dunno how much longer I'll play though.,4
"I've grown to like this game, after I learned a few things I started liking it more. Love the characters.",5
Really fun. Too much grinding though.,4
Unable to play,5
amazing,5
been playing for about 3 weeks and its pretty good. i usually get bored but the story keeps it going. the game play is easy and the co-op makes the game a bit easier to complete so itd a plus when you're stuck when low level. this game is 5 star for me.,5
"It is a little daunting when you first get into the game as there is a huge learning curve with not enough support, but it's good overall. I would ask the developers if there was a way to make seeing details of characters and wyrmprints easier because as it stands, my phone is very sensitive and will think I'm either just tapping, or trying to scroll when I just want to see details.",4
wtb emulator support,4
"Fun game once you get used to controls. Units are more valuable than in other gachas, grinding them can be a bit of a pain at times, though.",5
great game so far,5
Shockingly involved and fun for a mobage. Do more than just mash the attack button.,5
"Entertaining story you can get invested in to, really cute art and character sidestories. Be warned, its a grind heavy game, and the controls can be a little clunky, especially Force Strikes. very appreciative of the constant updates and additions of bunches of QoL tweaks.",5
its cool,5
"i love this game, so much content, its really fun.",5
best game of its genre! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. And no im not a fake review. These are my actual genuine feelings for this game,5
"Cygames is the best company I've ever seen handling a phone game. They listen to their fans and are on top of bugs so fast. The games plays really well, but most importantly all gacha characters are beautifully drawn and have cute 3d models. 10 out of 10. Would recommend Cygames again. <3",5
Pretty fun game with lots to do low drop rates but a very generous game regardless.,4
fun,5
great devs and great game so far,5
"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! It is addictive, well put together, graphic's are nice, the music's nice, enough to deal with, but not at all too much. Great for down time (at work, shh). The events are constant as well. All around awesome!!",5
"Fun game, but... constantly have to download additional data or updates and it's already a pretty large game. Super annoying. has a batch download function so if you feel like doing it all at once you can, but it still asks to download additional stuff as you play. Haven't uninstalled it yet, but I'm considering it as I don't like to bog my device down with unnecessary items; and as fun as this game is, it's not necessary and it's a large game.",2
the communication from the dev team to the community is the best ive seen in mobile gaming other companies should take notes,5
"The game is more stable now, enjoyed different events on every months, pls keep working on the story line",4
its kinda fun but kinda grindy,4
"The game has gotten a lot better. Not perfect, but now my main phone game I play.",4
A fun gacha without much difficulty and very little emphasis on spending.,5
"One of the more interactive and fun gacha games on the market. Viable to be a f2p player and still enjoy the game's content and events. However prices for buying currency is ridiculously high. $30+ for a standard 10 roll? No, thank you. However the game is rather gracious with it's handing out free gems to summon units so that's a positive. Allows you to play with English or Japanese VO for those who care. Would recommend to anyone who wants to play a gacha without most of the bad aspects.",4
"This is a very cute game, the character back stories are hilarious. I always crack up when I read the back stories.",5
pretty fun game I like how they implement a lot of stuff to make the game better and I love the events,5
Fun game,4
"Overall the core functions of the game are perfect. Only qualms were the forced online aspect despite being bots. But beyond that the game is very engaging, and just a joy to play. The added auto run feature that also targets chests is a major bonus during non raids. Can't wait to see what else gets added and improved upon. Highly recommend this app.",5
It's definitely a good game. I like the storylines and how there is always some new story or quest coming out. Also the game is frequently updated. It keeps it fresh and interesting.,5
"Currently my favorite gacha game. Devs are very generous, and 5* units, while piwerful, arent necessary. Writing is excellent!",5
"Game is really fun, there are a few issues, but overall really fun and game progression is balanced. I wish the co-op was better set up for friends, like being able to join up on a friends posted quest without the need for a code. Having to txt is cumbersom and my game has closed due to this.",5
one of the best gacha games I have ever played.,5
Shop is not working at all. Contacted support and just got a useless copy paste message. Game would be 5/5 if they could get it working properly.,5
"Fun game overall, with a pretty good story line. What makes this a 5* game for me is the fact that the developers seems to actually take player feedback seriously and are always trying to improve the player's experience. They're super generous as well so you dont have to expect to shell out a ton of cash to keep up. Makes me want to spend a bit here and there to support them.",5
f.,5
very fun so far,5
immersive,5
"Needs alot of space unless you want to download levels as you play, but it has a great story, cool gameplay, and actually have good programmers who keep up with the game so any screw ups are usually fixed within a day or two👌top tier game, top tier waifus, would play again",5
dropped to 2* rating dev's are getting greedy rates have been dropped. limited stamina. same grindy bosses over and over nothing new or rewarding. unfortunately i had high hopes for this game especially since its from Nintendo and really wish i could get money back that i had spent on this game. if your looking for a good getcha game I'd look elsewhere.,2
enjoyable game to play in short bursts,5
This game is fun!,5
"This game is amazing! I'm enjoying it so much. Dragalia Lost is way better than PUBG or any game in the google play store. The only problem is that it takes up a lot and I mean a lot of space on your phone, if you're going to download this game I recommend to have at the least 16gb of internal storage. Other than that this game is so good!!",5
"Highly Polished, fun gameplay. Early levels are a little too easy but Im sure they'll ramp up soon.",5
very fun experience and easy to learn. i never could have expected this to be from nintendo,5
"giant install - then a giant ""update"" - play 1 level - another giant download - play 1 level - download again! Its a cute game but you download levels one at a time taking 15-30 mins to download a less then 5 min level. It will eat your phone.",1
"Great UI, production values, and music. The character design is alright but the action gameplay is somewhat awkward with mobile controls",4
"Awesome story, gameplay, graphics, control,characters etc. Basically everything about this game is AWESOME!!",5
"This is the most engaging mobile game available, with the best music, constant QoL improvements, and excellent gameplay.",5
"This should be a 4* game but connection drops and overheating drops it to a 3. Controls could be better, as well as the targeting system. Overall not bad with room for improvement. Hopefully some PvP soon? Also as of right now very f2p friendly. Update December 2018: many improvements been made, and the developers actually listen to the players. Still would like to see some PvP and more endgame content. 4.5/5 stars",4
(Update) i have played many Gacha games since Gacha became a thing. Never have I seen as much developer engagement with the community and reward for developer mistakes. Coming from KHUX where it was pay to win everything to Fire Emboem Heroes being perfect in every way but just got stale for me sadly. Both games i put alot of money into (whaling) but felt no real return on investment. This game changed all of that. This game be crack!,5
"Fun game if you like dragons and quirky characters. Seems more fair with freebies than most games. Grindy, but fun.",5
really good,5
Takes so long to download and tells me I have an error when nothong is wrong,1
decent,5
Beware if you delete the game without linking a nintendo account all progress and real money spent will be lost.,1
A great dungeon crawler-esque game. Devs and Support are great (Bless CyGames) with constant gifts and genuine answers to their tickets,5
its a great game but.. the force closes if you play it for a long time and that can be a bit annoying but other than that its a great game and ive been playing since it first launched,4
"This games really good but my only gripe is thr controls, an option to change them to traditional joystick and attack button would help out alot.",5
"This is what Nintendo was missing in the WiiU. Adventure with realitive ease to start, moving into the ability to create teams for adventures... I am both glad and sad to finally see a guild form game that could replace Square Enix ""My Life as a King"".",4
很cute啊,5
A favorite!,5
"Been playing around 2 or 3 hours. I love the chibi art style, character design, music, and the simplicity of the controls. I feel like playing on a larger device would be much easier (I am on a Galaxy S8), but overall, Im enjoying myself.",4
Overall it's a good game. The graphics are good. Movement is slightly frustrating when you first start out. Been able to obtain free in game currency fairly easily. Obviously a gacha game. So always be mindful of that. Story is still slow to start out. Each character and dragon that you obtain has a story attached to them. I'd say give the game a whirl. It's fun.,5
fun,5
App does not complete downloading - stuck on .05mb then get Network Error Occured . galaxy j3 2017,1
highly recommend this game over others. the dev's and staff really care and it shows. they constantly and continually update and listen to what people say. I told the epic 7 staff they should be more like dragalia lost.,5
"excellent game! im not someone that get addicted to app games and this one has me HOOKED. Loving the graphics and characters! So far, so good!",5
"Even though I have everything muted sounds and music go full blast every time you start the app. Takes forever to get into the settings, and even though it's all at 0 volume you have to move to one then back to 0 to mute. Walking is not good. Would rather have some solid joystick mechanism or better control of direction and speed. update. fixed sounds for now. good game. very grindy.",3
"The presentation, story, content and translations are top notch and it doesn't require a 5 star char to progress. It would be nice if they would add a full screen option to hide OS navigation and the notification bar but its not a deal breaker. My only real complaint is that after all the fixes/tweaks they have not removed Wyrmprints from the pity rate increase every 10 summons.. In the end Cygames is an excellent company that listens to the community and I'll be playing this game for a while..",5
Best game im not playing. The ONLY problem I have is with the controls. They're a bit unintuitive & uncomfortable.,4
pretty fun,4
great game amazing music. would love to do voice work for them,5
love this game,5
"Unlike most gacha games similar to this, its pretty fun even without spending any money, and from what i can tell it seems generous with giving out rewards.",4
I love it,5
Actually entertaining.,5
very awesome game,5
"A great game with a few flaws. Pros: - Excellent graphics and audio. - Very generous with most in-game resources. - Frequent events with more goodies. - Developers are quick with the bug fixes. Cons: - Very stingy with the resources to elevate characters and gear to the highest tiers. - Gatcha system is expensive, with characters, dragons and equipment all mixed together and generally poor draws. - In-game purchases are expensive and almost exclusively for consumables.",4
Just started the game already have a full team of 4*. It is a really fun game I'd highly reccomend it to those that like games like the Tales of Series as it plays pretty simular to those types of games and rpgs in general. It does have quite a bit of loading but that is easily fixable with downloading the full package.,5
like the game. can not download update though for some reason so cant play,3
overall well lags a little on my amp prime 2 but overall bravo,5
fun and epic game,5
So far so good! it's keeping me on my toes but isn't too hard. interesting gameplay for someone that's used to turn-based games.,5
existence is a vice,4
pretty boring. constant micro loading of content. nothing interesting to even buy until you spend $25 for one 5 star. thats just way too much. i got to level 70.,2
Super good love it,5
cute game with generous gacha,5
Great RPG. The more I play the more I love the story and world of Dragalia. The controls are also pretty good. My only comment would be to load all the story content with each update or when the game initially loads instead of every time I get to the next level. That could be costly to users who don't have unlimited data or using wifi while playing.,5
good but controls are tricky to remember,4
Very Fun! Just Wish The Stamina System Didn't Exist...,4
This gave me a very fun time.,5
i cant play it. there's an error screen every time i open it. :(,1
great!,5
fun,5
"Usually Mobile Games don't keep my attention enough past a week. Not even FE Heroes (I blame that mostly on not having played the titles.) But Dragalia Lost has kept my interest for well over 3 months now. I love the characters, stories, and the dragons are neat. Even the crafting system wasnt all that bad, just slightly tedious, but time passing to work with.",5
really cool game,5
"very fun and cool, thanks nintendo!!!",5
pretty fun game... you can make any character useful with enough investment,4
"The game is fun, but suffers from a horrible summon system that plagues these gacha games. It feels bad when you have friends that consistently summon all of the units and dragons while you are stuck summoning useless Wyrmprints. A note on that: Wyrmprints have the summon rate of both dragons and units COMBINED. Don't expect to be able to pick the pool you can summon from either as there is only one. While there is a good game under it, this really holds back the potential which really sucks.",2
"The game is amazing! I love it very much haha good job Nintendo, only complaint is maybe make like raids that require maybe around 10m to get thru with a 5m boss? Something to make the Co-op better because atm tbh Co-op is pretty useless with how fast missions end ya know? Also maybe an open world zone that let's u see other players roaming around and has mini quests or world bosses that spawn? And lastly maybe the option to flip the screen horizontally. But amazing game.",5
short and sweet its interesting and fun,5
"This game is beautiful in every way. I haven't played a mobile game so much in my life. Thanks Nintendo, only you could make me enjoy gaming on my phone.",5
great game,5
Absolutely incredible game,5
"Pretty fun, if you like a story based RPG then this is for you.",5
needs you to make your own charter,5
goid game but keeps freezing after quest completion on my pixel 2 xl and my red hydrogen one.,3
not bad,5
"This game seems perfect. Not only is it free but it's also a mobile game, that I can see being ported over to the switch",5
great,5
hey i just unlocked the jean de arc character and the didn't register it with my team someone fix this asap,5
"Thank you so much for fixing the Auto Combat system, fixing the auto route system and adding the controlled player to the auto skill use roster. The game has greatly improved and as such, so has my rating.",5
best game ever.,5
My coworkers got me into this game.,5
its neat,4
pretty lit,5
Just started and I already forsee myself dump many hours here.,5
This game is fantastic!,5
"Would give it zero stars, cant play the game, wont recognize my network connection to download set up file. Im on xfinity wifi currently with a 77.3mbps download speed, I have a Samsung Note 8 phone.",1
"actually pretty fun and a neat play style (think zelda spirit tracks turned into a mobile game [just in the aspect of controls]), but it takes like 3 gigs of download space",5
great graphics and playability.,5
Great combat gameplay,5
It grear and cool,5
A fun take on the top-down RPG with fun characters and great production value,5
Wonderful game !!!!!!,5
"Dragalia is a super fun and amazing game made by two of the best game companies, Dragalia Lost will however force you to mourn over gacha luck because that's what this is, a gacha game. It's like the final fantasy gacha but much better. Beautiful, graphics even BETTER music I even have it saved upon my playlist of music's it's so wonderful, and not to mention the amazing characters and stories with them (dragons too)! All and all it's a great game if you have the data storage and the patience.<3",5
Great graphics and voiced gameplay.,5
pretty fun and engaging,4
very fun and easy to play and the fact i can play it every day makes it all the most fun,5
Gacha will make u strongggggg,5
"super fun, loving it so far",5
Nintendo does the best games and that doesn't change on the mobile platform.,5
I love these types of games! Reminds me of Legend of Zelda and Undertale! Would definitely recommend to a friend.,5
good story and really enjoy the one handed playstyle,5
fun game awesome good job nintendo!,5
great game story,5
Amazing,5
very nice controls,5
I really love this game.. it's easy to play and it's so funny... i can't stop playing..,5
cool,5
"I love this game! Its not another RPG. Its action, adventure. This game is just my style. And with the stories and comics, top notch. And the graphics...amazing. Please make an anime based on this game. Great job nintendo.",5
Mega cute and super addicting~,5
This is the best mobile game I played so far. Amazing graphics great story and easy to use combat system. The cinematic scene and animation is outstanding as well.,5
"The game is fun. I'd like to see it on Switch, because my phone could not hold all of it, even after deleting a mass majority of my songs, and images.",5
fun and addicting,5
Couldn't even play the game because of bad connection but connection was fine,1
"Like the game. But ended up uninstalling it. Your always having to install levels (every time for every level), updates, etc some installs take forever. game play was fun though.",3
"it is an amazing game. I love the story, the graphics, the action.",5
Nintendo please make the file size smaller I deleted the game because its almost 3 gigabytes big thats insane soon to be 4 im tired if you cant fix this than people will start saying no to this,3
it's awesome it has good graphics Its just awesome,5
awesome,5
nice,4
Nice RPG game!,5
Nothing less the an epic game of the year,5
"Very well made gacha game with outstanding music, stories & characters were a real grab for me as usually I'm not entirely interested in mobile game stories. Summoning even introduces a ""pity rate"" system. Not as good as FEH but it's nice to have nonetheless. This game can be a HUGE grind fest, so it might not cater to those who are pretty casual or simply don't have the time to play.",4
great story beautiful graphics... very enjoyable gameplay,5
its a really fun game,5
"I absolutely love this game, and the developer constantly gives the players items for free. However, once you get to a high enough level, I'm not sure how you play the game as F2P. I wouldn't suggest this game to people with little patience, as it is definitely a gacha game at heart. That being said, if you don't mind throwing good developers come cash here and there, this game certainly delivers.",5
super fun so far cant wait to get deeper into the story!!,5
this is it chief,5
I love Nintendo so i love that they came out with a game for phone (fone),5
The game is very fun and has a good feel to it. You should make this a Nintendo switch game.,5
Great game,5
the characters are good and the graphics are incredible. and Nintendo somehow managed to sneak in some cussing. impressive!,4
trying to move around is a little difficult. other then that. I'm enjoying the game.,5
awesome,5
good,5
i hate the ads,1
"How come after I delete all data, I still have to go into apps and delete all data because of errors? Why can't I just restart at the Title Screen?",4
10/10,5
its great,5
this game is butt cheese,5
its a must play for those whose love RPG s,5
"This is an amazing game, that's all it is. I've been playing since Loyaltys Requiem (2nd/3rd week of release) and I can't help myself from playing. It may be pay to win in some cases, but I've yet to pay a dime and I have around 10 5*s (although they're mostly wyrmprints) it's not so bad. I'm also 200 might from the High Dragon Trials! (13,000 required) It's not as Pay to Win as you'd think, and it's plenty worth the 2.5 GB.",5
like it,5
"amazing time killer, thanks Nintendo",5
nice,5
Best mobile game I've played yet!,5
Very Fun!!,5
This is probably one of the best gatcha games I played. The developers are very responsive to the community and open when something in the game is broken. You can clear all content in the game(with the exception of high dragon trials) without paying a single cent. Controls can be clunky at first but you'll get used to it. Music and graphics are great. Overall great game. However the game is still a gatcha so spend responsibly. 10/10 would definitely recommend.,5
To much updates,3
very interesting but the constant downloads of data slow the game,4
Always unstable.,1
"Pretty fun phone game, haven't gotten too far into it but I can tell I will love it.",5
Breddy gud :DDDDD,5
great game!,5
There are many complaints about the gacha mechanism. But remember that is for payers who support this game substantially. You don't have to pay literally at all to enjoy this well-designed and friendly developed game!,5
love the game,5
why are there so many dlowloads and my name was going to be dragon tamer but that was to many charters so it put dragon tam👿👿👿👿👿😡😡😡,4
The game constantly freezes and I need to restart it. Uninstalling. Fun otherwise.,2
"It doesn't play like any other gachas I've experienced, its really fun and simple but also surprisingly complex. I adore the art and music, a very cute and unique experience brought from Nintendo!!",5
awsome,5
good af,5
i love this game it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💗💗💗💗❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
"I was pretty certain I would never give a gacha game any amount of money, but now I've given it $8. Maybe I started playing at the right time, but the game is surprisingly generous with its resources. I decided to give the devs some money not just for making a beautiful game (which it is), but because they're quite responsive to player experience, once compensating a 10-minute outage with $30 of game currency. This is a team I hope many gamers will continue supporting.",5
"Well, I initially installed the game and the patch process was rather ling and tedious, but the game on the inside is good, it isn't the best JRPG I've played, but closer to kne of the better mobile games I've played. Install this if you need a time sink on your phone, but that's about all it has thus far, I haven't spent enough time to get down and dirty.",4
Great Game!!!,5
"I loved Dragalia Lost! My only conplaint is how much space it takes up. Other than that, a really fun game with great multiplayer!",5
"Fun and cute so far, I like the controls too.",5
great game!!,5
The DRAGON are AWESOME!!!!!,5
great,5
is gud,5
really smooth gameplay along with good 3D graphics. having to update on every level is slightly annoying but they are small updates (50mb-100mb so far) so its not all that bad,4
this is a game company that knows how to treat their customers.,5
download now! super fun. great characters and story. worth it,5
I like the game it's simple with a nice story and hero containing,4
Great Game,5
Fun game with cute characters,4
So far this is a fun game. i looked that it's broken up in downloads and it's easy to come and go.,5
Hey! It's pretty gooood,5
great gamen,5
controls might not be for everyone but if you can get used to it very enjoyable,5
"the combat is 10/10 for a mobile game too bad it can be easy if your lucky and summon 5 star heros right away. could be easily remedied with difficulty options. would 5 star if it had this and the movement can be janky at times as character doesnt move to where the finger is located but instead the direction, takes getring used to bit its fine.",4
Make a Nintendo switch port so we can connect the games,5
8.5/10,4
"An exciting, fun RPG!",5
Very fun!,5
"Graphics are cute, the music is fun to listen to, and the story is fascinating.",5
awesome,5
fune gane,5
"SO CUTE! I'm not usually into chibi style but it's adorable and the dragons are great, so far friendly to Summons, will update soon!",5
Love it! Wish it was available on the Switch.,5
Fun hack and slash RPG.,5
I can be a DRAGON,5
cool game it's the best and I got the guy with 5 stars he's cool,5
"not my type of my game, but good nonetheless!",5
can't see characters all black and just force stops terrible,1
"love this game hope theres a nintendo switch tie in and crossovers like granblue fantasy and stuff from square enix. art is super fun, music is great too.",5
"the game is great, just too much downloading though.",4
awesome,5
"i like it! just started, seems fun. lots to do! yaaaaay!!!",4
"Fun game, easy to farm 10x pulls, and it's pretty fun. Give it a shot",4
"Great game, great story, very generous gatcha, always updating with QOL improvements and events. 5* weapons are a little tough to get per the amount of resources needed to craft.",5
only game on my phone love it,5
Any mobile game that let's you transform in to a dragon is worth my time!,5
keeps telling me there's is an update needed but there is nothing to download,1
simple mechanics but very fun. Haven't played long enough to see if the IAP is required to progress,5
It good.,4
ggg,5
yay,5
This game is the This game is the best!!!,5
best game ever,5
super fun game cant put it down,5
good but this needs more anime things,5
fun game overall,5
"After finally getting the update, the game is tight. Stylish graphics that don't bog down the action on the highest setting, simple, addicting gameplay with absurdly complex upgrade systems, straightforward controls and excellent artwork.",4
amazing,5
fantastic game,5
nice graffics....easy gameplay,4
"for what I can see it looks awesome, everything a fantasy world you should expect but no multiplayer will decrease the game play for a lifetime",3
"Really love the game but can't play no more since the update...now I keep getting stuck in between loading pages for dragons, upgrading characters, summonings...every time I click it won't load the next screen...it worked fine on another phone I was borrowing before the update, but now it won't work on mine...",4
1 handed RPG!,5
Great game but it downloads large files for every new level in game. My phone only has so much room.,2
"Great game, love the story and the game play",5
Its super adorable great story gas a Rpg feel and the cutscenes are amazing at first but it starts to turn into reading 😁🤤,4
"This game is, at times, a total joy to play, and at other times aggravating. The gameplay is pretty fun, overall, but the total experience is frustrating. The summoning rate is GARBAGE so do NOT spend, it's not worth it. Just focus on pumping up the 4* heroes you pull, and focus on building up eldwater to promote them to 5* because you will get 5* faster this way, and face less annoyance. They put multiple summonable things in the same summoning as the one for characters.",3
"I really enjoy playing this game, but, for some reason, when it put me in the tutorial on entering, it wouldn't stop loading. Thanks for the help. Sorry that I just now remembered to fix this.",5
fun so far laggy tho i gave 4g lte even tried wifi still lag's,3
Yuuuuppppppp,4
The 1 and only problem I have is it wont update its currently at 340% and isnt stopping,4
"Nintendo did it again, but it seems the drop rates are becoming ridiculous for getting certaon characters. I went through the ten fold 3 times and still no seasonal character. My only complaint.",5
excellent game love the graphics and the storyline so far. also love the cut scenes.,5
"I want to give this app 5 stars, but I've been stuck at the loading screen at the Avenue to Power to create a room for 3 days now. I know the issue is being looked at so until then I'll just wait to play the game and change my review then",5
"Really enjoying this game so far! Most of the complaints I've read have centered around the gacha, but... that's the nature of gacha. Investing is not inherently necessary to beat anything; it just takes diligence and patience. (For what it's worth, I rolled a 5* limited and one of the best dragons in the game on free rolls, so P2W isn't in full effect here at all.) As far as the game itself goes, the graphics are wonderful, the music is absolutely killer (please release the OST on iTunes!!), and the story is enough to keep me interested. UPDATE (12.18.18): Having played DL for a few months now, I am pleased by the number of improvements made thus far. A lot of the mechanics are becoming streamlined (thank you for batch buy in the shop), though I feel that there can still be a few improvements made here and there, namely the drop rate for mats in the Dragon Trials. Other than that, I feel the developers have been very generous with gifts and rewards and still seem open to feedback from the userbase, which is fantastic. I'm greatly looking forward to the new chapter and future content from this team.",5
"Stuck in ""New Update Loop"" I was loving the game than it forced closed and informed me of a 7mb update....so i downloaded it. Than it told me there was another 7mb update.....so i downloaded it......this went on 15 more times before i made this review. Game is unplayable now.....sucks just unlocked the castle feature....",1
Thw game mechanics are fun and the music is amazing.,5
"I love the game! Only reason for 3 stars is that I updated the game today and after playing for awhile, a message sayi g a new update is available continued to pop up and lead me to the main load screen over and over and im no longer able to play. please fix this bug! thanks!!!",3
I love this game and would give it 5 stars but I can only play it about 1 of every 10 times I try to log in as the game has issues connecting to the servers,3
this game is dope af i only wish u could play it horizontally,5
Thie game is not bad the controls are,4
THESE UPDATES.... SO MANY UPDATES.... JUST HAVE 1 BIG PATCH PER MONTH PLS- STOP WITH THE ANNOYING UPDATES!!!!,3
Good game,5
This game is incredible. I am enjoying the storyline. Lots of details.,5
Error code 910 when trying to update,2
😎⚔️,5
This game could not get past the download screen.,1
Add a joystick to the game everything else keep and just to let u guys or lady's know yall did a good job on the game,5
Impressive,5
Lovednit so goodddddddd,5
"Easily my favorite mobile game and I've played a bit of them. Controls feel a little weird, but that's my only issue. 🖒",5
Lola and I are going to get a new one for the next two years and I will have a pretty good time for the next two months of my lifetime but i'm not going anywhere without my help from my family and my friends are not going to get the chance to do that for me because I have a lot of experience,5
👍,5
It's a solid game and they fixed my bug I had thanks Nintendo,5
Dope,5
I enjoy picking up this colorful RPG everytime.,5
This one of my favorite dragon games.You turn into a dragon.,5
Amazing fun game,5
Awesome game,5
Game.,5
Best game ever,5
"Great game, good depth, menus can be a bit tedious.",4
It's fun with a good story; I also like the switch aesthetic that it has going for it. I wouldn't mind it being on the switch if they decided to port it.,5
Got em,5
Takes a lot of space more than 1 gigabite,3
It free have good storys,5
Good game to past time!,4
Best mobile game I've played in months,5
Does not play. Says needed update even though it JUST UPDATED!!!,1
It's awesome,5
This game was funny and entertaining,5
great storyline and graphics,5
Kick it up,4
"Nice production value, music and gameplay with some elements of granblue fantasy in here. Really liking it so far, running great on galaxy s8.",5
It's is a fun game because you can get cool characters and dragons so yeah,5
Love anime and dragons so this game suits me,5
Lit game keep up the good work.,5
Best game,5
The game is really animated good and it has that story,5
Started playing because of the catchy theme song and fell in love,5
Everything was good until the coop part. I get that it is a new they bound to be bugs but why does it have error in one of the forced guides it makes no sense did they not have beta testers??,4
Love this game!,5
Very good wish updates came out faster but it's understandable.,5
Won't update takes me here every time I try,3
This is a pretty good game.,4
nice,5
I love this game very addictive i reccomend it to a friend,5
Amazing,5
Its really fun i love playing it,5
Lost my account because I had to uninstall the game but forgot to bind my account. Support could not do anything about that So PLEASE PLEASE bind your account. Overall fun game though but I don't be playing anymore as the amount of time invested was gone.,3
It's a fantastic game to play when you're free,5
"Get disconnected if a player has a full friends list, causing freezing of the game when loading from end-quest screen to main menu. Otherwise, totally solid game.",4
I really like this game. I enjoy the story and all of the event stories. It is really fun.,5
This game is amazing and I wish more people would play it,5
Very time consuming for those days with boredom,5
This is a very good mobile RPG. It's simple yet very complex at the same time and there's so much do to keep u enterta. Also this game is very generous compared to other gacha. Very F2P friendly.,5
Very good,5
Good but could use a little bit of better graphics,5
Great for daily train rides,5
"Love this app! Thanks for such a fun game! Wish there was a female avatar option, but nonetheless incredible story!",5
The game is impossibly buggy. I've spent the last two hours attempting to get past the title screen only to continually get authentication errors and requests for updates that don't exist.,1
Cool,5
So far the game runs very smooth and looks great. Music is pleasant as well 👍.,5
"Best game on the market. Easy on coins, no need to spend money.",5
I feel like this game is the best mmorpg,5
Man this soundtrack is amazing:weeb,5
"Controls are pretty bad, the sensitivity for using force strikes to break shield/guarding in this game is terrible, it conflicts with your regular tapping attacks or sometimes just makes you move instead. I recommend adding a dedicated charge button for people to hold down instead of the hold and swipe to aim system. Also the default for the quick 90 and 180 degree turns sucks and I recommend everyone turn it off. It causes the pointer to move to much and is bad for moving in any other direction than in a straight line. Great story, great game mechanics, just needs better control system for force strikes.",4
Still can't play co-op unless I'm on wifi. Everything is fine on my end.,5
very nice,5
Great so far! Keep it up!,5
Great game,5
"Cute graphics, engaging story, fun gameplay. The menus are a bit confusing at first, but once you've got them figured out, it's a blast.",5
It is a great game for the phone and it is very good strategy gameplay. Great for someone looking for a new game.,5
"Fun hack and slash. Auto fight available, though it never beats you actually controlling your team. Awesome graphics, an even better soundtrack. For those that like min/max, Draglia offers several deep upgrading systems for your weapons, cards case and dragons. It really reminds me of Fire Emblem too, so if you are into waifus/husbands you'll dig it.",5
"The graphics and music are superb and easily the best part of the game. The game runs very smoothly and does not cause my device to overheat. The controls are wonky, I find the character very hard to control. The story has been alright so far, nothing amazing but not awful. The gacha system is...bad. The rates for five star summons is incredibly low, worst I have personally seen from any gacha game I have played. Luckily, you can get by with four star characters. Edit: Many QoL updates have been added. The game is quite enjoyable. With every banner event thus far we have gotten a free 10 summon voucher as well!",4
I love the story. Nice game. You must get it to experience the game.,5
"Worth all the time spent playing, interesting stories that make you fall in love with characters journeys and fantastic gameplay for a mobile game. Don't hesitate, download it.",5
Greatest game ever,5
I LOVE THIS GAME!,5
Cashgrab new IP. Hope you like wyrmscripts!,4
"The only bad grind is the master level insignias for 5 star weapons. Everything else is fun to craft and grind for. Game plays good, never crashes. Would like to see a few raids always available.",5
"Alot of fun , like the multi player aspects of the game. Cool events , not impossible to get good rewards!",5
"I really enjoy the game I like the skip tickets so I don't have to waste my time grinding from materials I really enjoyed the adventurer Designs & Dragons but the summoning system is pretty bad because you can summon three different things from it like dragons, adventurers, and wyrmpints. I think having the dragons and the adventurers in the same summoning pool is okay because basically you control both while wyrmpints should be in its own summoning pool because it's basically a equipment card that gives your adventurers resistance or bonuses it should get its own summoning category and probably should cost less because you have to get 150 when you're using single roll or 1500 when you're using the 10 roll",3
Fun,5
INCLUDE MII OUTFITS IN ULTIMATE OF THE PRINCE,5
"Lots of fun, not glitchy, entertaining.",5
This game is a gatcha but it's a fun game none the less. Trying to get the character you want is very difficult even if you're a wail but you can still have fun using the characters you have and just enjoying the story. Music is a 10 and I just enjoy the game overall compare to ask other gatcha games. Would highly recommend!,5
I really like it,4
I hate Chibis.. but the controls and how the game plays I feel makes up for it. But I still haven't decided if I will commit,5
"Super fun game. Great graphics, cool characters, and gameplay that is deep with interesting mechanics but simple enough for casual mobile gamers.",5
Pretty fun so farm still early in though.,5
"This has to be one of the best gasha games ever. The rates are better then any other game. Starting 4% that increases every 10 summons you don't get a 5*. Compared to others that have a 1-3% static chance. Every raid event you are given a free 4* character, a 5* dragon, and a 4* print for getting to a certain point, And facility events give 5* prints, realistically if you wanted to play this game and never spend money you can still do endgame content with what you're given it will take time, but can be done. And if you are having problems with the game asking you to download you can go into the settings and download everything at one time so you don't have to keep downloading, until the next update. And as of making this review every update has given players a free 10 summons ticket. Which you can save until you want to use it.",5
"Its quite nice to play, its kinda like a league game.",5
Beautiful game. Large in size but truly a beauty.,5
Its Pretty Gooood 👌👌,5
It's fun,4
Fun and addicted to it,5
A fun action rpg. With dragons.,5
Fun,5
Epic game,5
It's fun to play and easy to use I think everyone should give it a shot.,4
This game is a breath of fresh air. There are multiple ways to continue playing after you've exhausted your energy and the combination of different kinds of game mechanics makes this game truly unique. Love it!,5
"I just got this game and it is a really fun game. With a really good plot so, i encourage you to download the app and please play.",5
This game is like a grimy best friend. Just got the same 5 star character from a gifted 5 🌟 voucher. Thank you Nintendo,3
"A fun, light action RPG with fairly implemented mobile game mechanics.",5
Great game,5
Nice game,5
"The game is adorable. The graphics, the art, even the music gives a cutesy vibe. Like any other game from Cygames, very grindy and requires lots of farming to strengthen your characters. It's a big plus that every stage you complete gives you wrymites, every time you join co-op you get wrymites, and completing the dailies give you lots of freebies and more wrymites. Keep grinding for those resources. The controls are smooth but I have a hard time using one hand. I just don't like it.",4
I've only played the first 3 missions but it seems pretty fun so far. As always with these games the microtransactions and gatcha rates for 5* suck. I recommend playing until you need to pay and then move on.,4
"Neat story so far, the leveling is pretty good as well.",5
I love it so far,5
"After all the time its been out, its been a great experience even though i summoned extremely little. They listen well to the community and made the game as fun as it could be. Theyve been even nicer giving us a free 5* adventurer, sure gacha is gacha with wyrmprints but this was a nice gesture, the support has been great from this game and i think its worthy of 5*s now. (Wish me luck on the Christmas event! Gotta use literally everything i saved since Halloween)",5
Great game to play,5
"Incredibly refined game. From the high-pace, smooth action, to the intricate cross references in each character's story. This game is truly wonderful. Shout-out to the developers as well who consistently listen to players complaints and compensate generously. Do be careful about your spending though.",5
"Awesome gameplay, addictive.",5
Good game,5
This games dope,5
This is a classic money grab where not only the characters are gatcha but 4 peices of equipment for each character is gatcha guard your wallet avoid this game,2
Simple fun little game with a bit of story,4
"Love this game! The graphics look amazing, especially for a mobile game. Looks wonderful on my Note 9. The music and vocals are also awesome. The storyline is really interesting, and I love the in-game comic that is available-- gives lots of neat info on the characters! The only potential negative is the size of the game file/extra downloads, as that might bug some folks-- but it is not a problem for me personally. If you like anime style rpg's, this game is for you :-)",5
Pretty guud,5
Would be an awesome game if there wasnt contant need to download more info all the time. I cant even start the game cause every time it needs to download more and takes 20 to 30 mins.,2
"Overall it has a good story, controls, gameplay. I can't wait for the next update to bring more story!",5
"Pretty solid, enjoyable experience",5
I love this game. Nintendo did a great job with it,5
I think l this is a great story game,5
"I really enjoy this game for the story, the bosses and music. My problem, much like mamy others, is the controls. I got used to them, but they are still kind of annoying.",5
Great good far im enjoy it,5
Great story and soundtrack. Lots of good voice acting. It's cute so I like it.,5
I love the dragon element in the game,4
It's really good but maybe a little more emphasis on the bazongas on some characters if you know what I'm saying,5
Fun game but controls could use work,5
It's cool to see something so polished on a mobile device!,5
Surprisingly good Action rpg.,5
Good gameplay. Only drawback I can see is the controls can be hard to figure out at first. Not sensitive enough. It is possible it is just my phone. The stories are very well done and I enjoy them. Most games I just skip the stories. This game makes it easy for me to connect with the various characters. And ftp vs ptp is fair and we'll balanced. 5 stars overall,5
"Update: The latest update to exchange multiple items has been added. I now have absolutely nothing to hate about this game. Keep up the awesome work :) Frequent patches to address feedback. Improved game controls and AI. Love it so far. One thing I'd like to see is multi-exchangeability for Treasure Trade. That ruins my daily gaming flow so if that's fixed, just take my wallet. Love this game.",5
I love the story and dragons like auto play ability also all around fun impossible to get lost data due to glitch be careful spending money,5
"The devs have been listening to the players and giving out both rewards and freebies when there are small bugs, bugs that get fixed quickly and quality of life changes happen often.",5
Super fun!!!,5
Just fix the character 5 star drop rate and this game would be great nothibg but cards and dragons,3
Looks great from ads but I wish the graphics were like the logo because it reminded me of the zelda games I really loved the zelda games but now I'm disappointed,3
"Catchy music, MMO ARPG on the phone with a company that takes player feedback into consideration. Main story can be enjoyed super casually, while hardcores can grind to fight endgame extra High Dragons.",5
Dragalia Lost... Nostalgia Found!!!,5
"Game is fun and easy to learn with plenty to do, good voice acting, and great music.",4
"I want to say this is Nintendo's second best mobile, because Mario to go. The story is usual jrpg but there's something about the DS inspired gameplay that makes me want to keep playing.",5
This game is the best!,5
"Totally fun! It's like playing an actual game with an actual story and likeable characters, like a game should be. It's really nice so far. Very generous to beginners!",4
It's a really good game and you get to be a dragon It's the best,5
Fun as heck,5
Its an amazing game with a great storyline.,5
"The only problem I have is the insane amount of time it needs to download things, but aside from that I love it!",5
Great game for the price!,5
it's a great game easily addictable flow that's kind of what you can expect from Nintendo the good game Nintendo,5
"An amazing game! I'd love to see more of it, the only issue i have is, sometimes the game will reset to the home screen after finishing a cutscene. (I'm sure it will be solved soon) c:",4
"Really large download for a mobile game, but a really fun game.",4
"Amazing, very welled played out.",5
"The action is a bit repetitive, the story so far seems really generic, and the constant cutesy anime music is sure to turn some people off. But this game may be a good starting point for those looking to try out free to play games.",3
Nintendo has out done themselves by bring out this game out of the blue. It's not the norm that they bring a new IP like this. Good job Nintendo!,5
Best arpg I've played on a phone.,5
This is the first mobile game that's completely hooked me.,5
Great story looking forward to more,5
They just keep making it better!,5
Game is very enjoyable.,5
This game is the best,5
This is a super fun collection and fighting game so far,5
The game is so fun and time consuming,5
I love this game but it takes too much space and kills my battery quick... Good thing: They really added my girl DAOKOs music in here. 💕,4
Stop making me view adds for this stupid game,1
Awesome game,5
"It's good, but it takes up too much space.",4
Great game just hate that you have to download everything on every step... Why cant it just be regular and get one big download then casual updates?? All this downloading adds up fast,3
Im not sure why this game doesn't have a higher rating. It's a lot of fun and it's free! My only complaints are the controls and how there is a huge delay after I attack before it let's me move again. I'd rather have an option for an on-screen joystick and faster fights where I'm not stuck in an attack animation.,5
"Simplistic hack and slash with just as simplistic crafting system. The character and dragon stories that are unlocked through increasing the stats are in the vein Fire Emblem, giving the player more background info on them, some of them being great. Gacha is cruel, but the devs do hand out a free 10 summon ticket with new character releases",3
File size is to big and the disruption dosent tell you how much memory on your phone is needed untill after it's downloded 0/10 for misleading consumers,1
"It's a really good game in the short tiem i played it. But the game is super large, be warned.",4
Fun game,5
Nice game!,5
Amazing. Period!,5
"Horrible controls make the game frustratingly unplayable. Edit: Control changes made the game playable ,but still horrible, review upped to 3 *",3
"This is exactly what I was looking for in a mobile RPG. You can, of course, play OSRunescape, but this is better if you just want to pick up and play. It's simpler, with a good story, and very enjoyable. So far it hasn't been what id known as ""pay to win"", although it has microtransactions for certain items, which can still be obtained with time. Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but it's great for solo play!",5
Its aight,5
Great,5
"At first I was on the edge with this game but nintendo really outdid themselves with this. The soundtrack is outstanding, especially for a mobile game",5
"I really like it as far as I got in, not far past the tutorial, but what turned me off is that every new section of game needed another additional download. You download, upon opening it it's another 500 mb, I think, then after the tutorial another gigabyte then after that another some mb that's for a cut scene and then after that another gigabyte. I ran out of room on my phone. I was loving it but you need a lot of storage. It does say in the settings you can choose to download it all at once but it bothers me when you download a game and it all of a sudden needs additional downloads, why not download it all in the first place?",4
I'll reclaim them all,5
Amazing game! Devs constantly fixes issues and makes this game enjoyable,5
Good,5
"Honestly a lot more enjoyable than I was expecting. I personally don't like games with gatcha systems, mostly because it feels like you have to buy into it in order to not suck. That doesn't feel like the case with this one, which is nice. I expect part of the reason is that the game gives you three 4(out of 5)-star characters very early on, so there's none of this, ""I need to play the gatcha to not suck"" feeling. Also the characters and story are charming, and the combat is fun.",4
"I loved this game for the full 2 minutes I got to play before you have to download a whole extra GB. It's fun, but just stick to console games if you can't produce an app that doesn't take up much space. I mean, jesus, most of our phones come with installed garbage we can't delete that already take up most of our storage space.",3
"Love it, but i wonder how it would be if it were remade as a console game",5
THIS GAME IS AMAZING,5
"Alright I have a problem right off the bat with this game, the problem is how much time you spend downloading it, 2 massive downloads just to play the game, plus you have to download each chapter of the story after you complete your current chapter, it doesn't take long though so I'll let it slide a bit. Honestly if you wanna keep it then you might wanna free up some storage, but other than those problems. This game is fun, the Nintendo graphics look good, the voice-overs and voice acting is good, the controls to me are okay, plus gameplay is also good. Should other people play it? If you have the storage and time to finish the 2 massive downloads then yes, or else you'll keep it in your library of games until you uninstall it.",4
This game is insanely fun and addicting. What's really nice is that you don't need the best of the best to progress in this game. Every unit can be deemed formidable and leaves it to the user to pick who they want to invest and progress with. The dev's also are really great at addressing issues and compensating for difficulties,5
"Other than a few spelling and grammar mistakes, this is a masterpiece that I absolutely adore",5
Lots of fun cute characters interesting enough story good job guys,5
"Rng is what you'd expect. I dropped 9 ""10-pulls"" and didn't get a single 5 star unit. Bad luck yes but still, uninstalled.",3
Love it,5
It was a great game I love how I can turn into a dragon!,5
Set-up great for playing shirt intervals throughout the day,4
"Love the story, action and the concepts are inspiring",5
"Honestly, great work done. Utilizes Packet-Switching to provide high quality interface and gameplay. Dialogue far surpasses all other gachas so far.",5
BORING AND TEDIOUS,1
Pure Awesome.,5
Cool cool i like it,5
"A fast paced Granblue, with the fun spin Nintendo puts on things.",5
This game is lit,5
I have aspbergers syndrome and i think that this game is great,5
"I think that this game would be better on a gaming console or computer, mobile phones and tablets don't cut it.",3
Its fun,4
"A 10pull is $32. Performed this 10 times, no rainbow tier draw of any kind. Pool is split among three types of pulls.",5
I WUV THIS GAMEEEEEE,5
AMAZIBG GRAPHICS,5
Dragon awsome,5
I actually find this game fun. And I love the characters you can get,5
Good,5
It's a great game but my only issue with the game is that later in the game it becomes much harder to get wyrmite. I would buy some but they are extremely expensive.,4
Easy and fun,5
It is a very funny and interesting game.Great job indeed. The only thing and is the poison effect lasts too long,4
"Easy to pick up, decent voice acting",4
Im really feeling it,5
Can't find autoplay. Not much variety. Boring. Characters seem decent though...,2
"The game 's gacha Summon system makes it pay to win. The main story is enticing, but most of the sub-characters' stories feel forced and unnatural, and they don't make sense half the time. The rarity system dominates the game with most 3-star characters/etc being absolute trash. And the AI is just atrocious. Your AI-controlled teammates will run into the circles that indicate where the enemy will strike soon and get themselves killed. They are awful and will lose you missions. Overall, it's kept me occupied up to level 40, but there's so many big flaws I can't recommend it.",3
It fun simple and a great time killer. If there are flaws they are overshadowed by the fun and simplicity of the game.,5
"very good game, maybe the best mobile game I have ever played",5
"i love the concept and story line so far. i feel as if the game could use more in the sense of items and explainations of said items all i know is to ""optimize"" maybe i will learn more later",5
"Would give this game 5 stars but the amount of ""communication errors"" and disconnects during co-op is simply overwhelming.",3
Fun so far,4
"Love the game, but beyond frustrated that my purchase glitched. Won't go through. It's been over a week and I submitted a ticket. I can't purchase anything else until this is fixed.maybe mods don't care?",2
"Dragalia Lost is exciting, fast-paced, and enjoyable. The writing is better than the majority of mobile games, and most of the characters are entertaining (though perhaps not powerful) While the game can be ""grindy"", players are only forced to grind if they want to play the hardest content.",5
The app is too large...and it just like the white cat project..,2
Fun,5
Not bad,4
I think it's just fine. Definitely going to take your time.,5
"This game is very interesting and well made. It is one of the best one-handed games around and is very fun to play. The downsides I have(had) right now are having to download missions a lot (but you can just go to settings and download all content). Another is opening the app; it usually takes a long time to connect to your servers, and if I have a weak (but not unstable) connection, it'll just say we can't connect. The time between me opening the app and actually playing is about 45s - 1 minute which is a little long. Another is the game doesn't take up the full screen, and keeps the bottom navbar up even if you're playing (if you can't remove it and make the game fullscreens, just make it black) and the top status bar is always on as well. Other than that, this game is actually super awesome and I look forward to all the time I'll be playing it",4
This is the best free to play game I've played to date. Idk how Nintendo continues to provide such semi original story lines. It does remind me .of the legend of dragoon for the PS and Mario RPG for the SNES. So combine those two for a new adventure with Nintendo's top of the line writers. It's an awesome game for mobile gaming anywhere.,5
Great game,5
So far i'm really enjoying the gameplay. It's pretty sophisticated for a phone game!,5
Too early to call it bad but there are lots of kinks for it to work out,1
It's like playing an anime,5
Asome and lit,5
"Way too many loading screens, way too much time downloading the game between maps.",1
This game is straight fire and can't wait to get my Nintendo switch. Keep up the good work guys,5
"It does everything wrong that other mobile games do wrong, and then also requires additional downloads for EVERY story mission. Competently made, just not worth it over any other option on the store.",2
Great animations and I love the characters,5
I love this game it was so inspiring and excited to me,5
Great story! Love it!,5
Pretty amazing game and runs very well with the exception of the many downloads as you play. Beautiful graphics for an android is feels a bit like console gaming. Id recommend doenloading all the data on Wi-Fi before really getting into it,5
Awesome story and gameplay.,5
Awesome mobile game of the year,5
Cool beans,5
"Good game, save for two things: one, the team AI is just... Just awful. They'll sometimes dodge, sometimes stand there and let it kill them. Usually it's option 2 and I'm left with just myself. Two, I keep getting disconnected during co-op play, even with a fantastic cell connection, or wifi connection. It's just random and drops me for no reason.",3
Fun game,5
Great,5
"I got into it because I was familiar with a few titles from CyGames, unfortunately the constant need to download was a gigantic turn off. Gameplay even on mobile should be seem less and Nintendo knows better then to allow this. Would rather download it all upfront than in microbursts.",3
The story was fantastic and amazing,5
"Cool, story and characters.",5
Nicely executed concept. Unfortunately has a stamina system.,4
The layout could be alittle better. The loading time get alittle annoying. Hut a great game none the less very pleased,4
"Controls suck and npc ai is turrible. Seriously the controls suck. Game could be much better, if the controls were better. Cannot stress enough how bad the controls are. Co-op needs better matchmaking, waste too much time waiting. Force strike controls are better, npc ai still turrible. They'll just stand right next too mobs and do nothing or run to you and not attack. Controls still need work, swiping and pushing can screw you and targeting could be better",2
Wish was less chibi but pretty good,4
Tiz gud,5
High quality game,5
Always froze my phone. Never wanted to work. Always had to hard restart my phone. Don't get this until they fix this major issue.,1
Neat,5
DAOKO that's all good choice for music.,5
Cute simple Diablo,5
A bit ti big in size lol but great so far,4
"Great story and music, loving it. Also the controls are good.",5
Good,5
Excellent art direction and sound design.,5
Decent game with a good story. Wish the gacha rates were a little better but it doesnt spoil the game overall. Combat is ok I just wish movement was a little more responsive.,4
Like the story so far,4
I love this game already and It has great catchy music,5
"It's a great game for anime lovers alike! It's laid-out really well and unlike other games similar to it, it isn't confusing and is adapted really well for english players. The art and animation has very little bugs, and it takes up a lot of space but it's worth it! The story line is really interesting, and considering I don't usually like roleplaying games, and not a HUGE anime fan, I love this game. I wish you could design characters though, or choose your gender and not have to be a boy, as I'm female. I still love it though. Nice job!!",5
I love it only thing I do have to say I just wish it didnt have to update every other quest but besides that I love this game,5
Great Game!,5
Very fun and beautiful!,5
Cool,5
I like it... I like it a l to,5
Its AMAZING!!! Its so fun and I love how quick it is to pick up,5
Fun and easy going game,5
"Feels meaty for a phone game, more like a 3ds game instead",5
Fun little action game. In some ways it reminds me of gauntlet and in others it is a mini Monster Hunter,5
Excellent rpg,5
When do funny to the store she wherever,5
Such a colorful game! Great work👌,5
"Great story, good voice acting, and easy to use controls. A very enjoyable game with none of the pressure of typical mobile MMOs to join clans or chase down a million quests.",5
Awesome graphics and like the story,4
"Very fun Dynamics, I wish it had a remote control feature so I can play with my console controller.",5
Awesome,5
"Love this game. RPG. Level up your characters, abilities, weapons, dragons, castle and base. Story is very good.",5
Seems well made so far but still only on Chapter 2 so let's see.,5
"This game has super easy controls, the only down side is the download size. Every mission you have to download along with the game that's over 1gb.",5
Love it not many games can ya play as or turn into a dragon.,5
Fun one handed gameplay with impressive music and voice acting,5
amazing for me,5
"The only problem I have with it is the data transfer, because even with my Nintendo account I lost several five star units and dragons.",3
"Fun...a great new franchise from Nintendo, at least if you like JRPGs.",5
Is ok,5
👍💪,5
"Was surprised by how much i like it. To many RNG games and the whole Anime style Jrpg usually pushes me away from these kind of games, but this one is pretty good. Involving story and the main characters are just basically handed to you as it should be. Real fun",5
Great music! Interesting albeit basic mechanics challenging enough to keep you grinding for loot!,5
Wont even load. Just a white screen.,1
The game seemed like a lot of fun but I can't even start it. I've attempted multiple times to play but I can't seem to connect to the servers,1
This is a fun game. I haven't had any issues with it so far.,5
Awesome!!!!,5
"Not just another phone game, fair business model, plenty of content available free, good rpg and crafting stuff, I really enjoyed it",5
Seems like lots of fun I like the anime type animation just don't like the controls maybe they should add a joystick in an update or something,4
Interested,5
this game sucks,1
Awesome,4
As long as you know what you're into with a mobile RPG you'll have a lot of fun with this one. It has the polish and gameplay youd expect from a Nintendo-published title.,5
Great,4
Awesome game! Keep it up!,5
Goog,5
Cute game with no paywall. The gameplay is fun and I'm having a great time!,5
So far so good. Not too intrusive on the pocket book,5
"The game is fun, controls are easy, and the story engaging",5
Keep it up,5
It is good,5
So bad,3
To slllooow,1
"Not as good as i wanted it to be. The gameplay is boring, the controls are slippery, and for some reason it needs a Wi-fi or data connection to run even though its mostly offline. A great way to distract your younger children probably.",3
Amazing!!!!! This is one of the best games ever! Keep on making it great.,5
it is very good. ost is so 🔥,5
Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars and the only reason I personally won't give it 5 is because of the controls that's it that my only qualm give me a fixed digital joystick.other then that it's a pretty good game noob friendly decent rng on my end interesting story,4
Awesome game!,5
Fun little game,5
Good story line and good graphics.,4
To much downloading. No thanks.,1
"From 10 mins playing any game, you can tell what games are cheap cash grabs, and what games were made with heart and soul. This game is the latter, with surprisingly high production values and charm all over, the biggest advantage it has over Grancrest war which functions the same. The weakest part of this game would be movement controls, since it is vertically aligned, leaving very little space to move with your fingers and you find yourself on the edge of your phone trying to move to the right.",5
"Too big to install, I have played nintendo games since my parents bought me pokemon so I decided to delete the other apps...",5
It fun but its feels like there are too many diffrent pieces to it,4
Fun,5
Fun anime type game. Controls are unique and graphics are solid.,5
This game is a 200 out of 10,5
Best rpg on mobile and music is awesome pls download I strongly recommend it,5
"Awesome game, little much talking tho",5
Awesome game ever.,5
GOTY 2019 but can i customize my dragon and my character like recolor them or give them hats and thanks,5
Good,5
Its epic how you can turn in to dragons and just the game its insane,5
The game is fun but the guest character wouldn't show up when I tried to put it in my party.,4
Love it :D,5
10/10!,5
Pretty much every mmorpg gamer's dream,5
Its GBF 2.0 so its pretty fun.,5
"A good mobile game. Story is decent, graphics are good, gameplay is fun.",5
Very detailed artwork. I play on the Note 9 and the color and controls are fantastic! Great job.,5
"Progress is slow if your not dropping some cash on the game, but overall this is a pretty great mobile experience.",5
I love this game. This is the best i love it.,5
This was an awesome story so far yet sad because of the events you have to go through I hope the next update brings the rest of the chapters. Also keep it up with the awesome story. I mainly hope that he can save his sister I the game.,5
So I'm trying to accept friends requests and it keeps telling me I'm at my limit when I'm sitting at 16 out of 30 please fix this,4
Great game awesome concept.,5
No,5
Bug: always reset to full volume every time restart the game. Not solving bugs for long time,1
Amazing game so far a little sad with how much I have to download just to play it but really love it otherwise.,5
Fun. Very enjoyable so far.,5
Great game incredible story,4
Some of the scailies I know liked this game.,4
"Not gonna lie, I knew nothing of this game when I pre-registered. I was recommended it because I play Fire Emblem: Heroes religiously, and when I saw this I fell in love. Dragons, a good plot, and a forgiving summon rate compared to other gacha games all make this a wonderful addition, and I will continue to reccomend it to others",5
"This is one of the best games I have ever played. besides pokemon, this game is just as fun, and its free. There is nothing better to ask for.",5
This game is awesome because of the story I could care less about the actually game.,5
Very dynamic gameplay,5
The game does take some time to upgrade ..everything..but worth the combat action adventure!,5
Three words: BOSS BATTLE MUSIC!,4
Great story. Very addictive,5
Great everyone can play,5
"Great addictive game with great graphics and easy to use controls. Actually has a story line and is pretty good, reminds me a bit of legend of the dragoon for the original PlayStation.",5
I couldnt Even start up the game. Error code 400 every time.,2
cool,5
After installing and reinstalling multiple times I just get an authentication failure and can't play.,1
"Fun, cute graphics. Awesome music. Good story. 4 player Co-op, even for main missions, makes it really fun to play with other people. Suuuper low gatcha rates. One thing that really bothers me, is the load screen times. They sometimes take longer than the actually playtime in the level that's loading.",4
"Very fun game, I can see myself playing this game for awhile.",5
Cool,5
Only annoying part is that I can't play with phone horizontal,5
I can't play this on my phone so I can't rate it above a one. If they fix whatever is stopping my model of phone from running the game then I will give it a better rating.,1
"WAY WAY WAYto much dialog and cut sequences that were boring. Also to many ""aditional downloads"". I mean, i did the full batch download that was supposed to get the full game instaled but nefore i could start the next mission, another download. And guess what it was for? A poorly written cut scene. Gameplay was great but the boring dialog scenes and extra downloads made me dislike very quickly. Just let me play the damn game nintendo...jeez",1
10/10 game but all these errors I keep getting are so annoying 2 big ones are connection errors and just errors when attempting to repeat a co op mission as the host. I cant get more than two consecutive games before getting that error. Fix it please I mean Nintendo really...,3
Good game,5
Fun game wish the controls we're set up like an actual controller but other than that it's a decent arpg type game,4
I had my doubts because most mobile games dont appeal to me but this one is way better than I expected! Thank you Nintendo!,5
This game had reminded me of my younger oc when it was still in the making. He looked and acted pretty much the same as this one here. That's what drove me to this game. Was the fact that it feels like bringing my OC to life. Thanks Nintendo for this amazing game. Rates 9/10,5
Awesome game,5
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,5
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet,5
Great game only issue is lag and the constant need to download each level need to allow you to download everything at once,4
Smooth controls and fun gameplay,5
Neat,4
Good time waster,5
Pretty ok,4
Great game. Hate how I have to download every chapter once I get to it instead of just one download for everything though. As someone without unlimited data or constant wifi it sucks.,4
"This is a great game! There's plenty of different things to do, and new content and events to make it interesting all over again! A great time killer, and I love the multiplayer features.",5
"This is a COMPLETELY CUTE GAME!!! NINTENDO, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!!!",5
Awesome game,5
Polished and high production values.,5
Fun,5
Good asf,5
"Honestly i have played faaar to many games to know understand or even care about the story BUT i do enjoy the gamplay mechanics as well as the graphics, it reminds me of bleach brave souls which is also a 5☆ game this is really well made guys and gals great job",5
"Great graphics, engaging story, easy controls, fun, upbeat music, character leveling system is good. I really enjoy this game!",5
A Very good one handed game!! Good game!!,5
Interesting and entertaining,5
Awesome,5
I love this game it's the best,5
I love this game so much. Its so fluid and the story is amazingly interesting,5
Great game,5
"Ton of fun, my girlfriend and I have been enjoying the co-op. Cygames has also been very giving with a free 10 pull every banner so far.",5
it's a great game but the problem is I've been waiting for well over a few months for the next set of chapters to come out after chapter 6. that's really the only problem I have with this game.,5
"simple but fun rpg, great for passing the time",5
Didn't think I would get hooked but I'm ALL IN!!!,5
"Funny game. Great story so far. Nice character development. Only issue I have really had so far is that the news/announcements window is completely in Japanese, so I can't read it. Everything else is in English for me, so I can still know what is going on in the story and enjoy it. Edit: Shortly after originally posting this it was fixed. So now everything appears in English for me.",5
Touch pad is a bit too sensitive but otherwise great game,5
"As expected of the creative talent behind Granblue Fantasy, this is yet another beautiful game with a loveable cast and an intriguing story.",5
Tis nice,5
Coming from Granblue Fantasy this game's pretty good so far. There are familiar grinding elements but waaaay toned down from GBF. 5 star rates are really low but you don't need it as the game gives you very viable 4 stars and your dragon and equipment setup matter. Also the story gives you 4 star dragons you can eventually fully limit break. Combat is heavily mechanical based which is awesome. I'm already seeing raid content similar to GBF in the future so that's really fun and NO LEECHERS (hopefully). This game has a lot of room to grow and hopefully Cygames is more generous with rolls then they're letting on atm. I'm sticking with this one.,5
This game is set above most app games. Good story with voice actors short and to the point. Excellent graphics and UI. So far works great but I run into stuttering in the music and random freezes.,5
I love this game so much and probably wont stop playing it. Ive been having alot of problems lately ever since the new event quest came about. The game crashes constantly and kicks me out of any co-op rooms. Ive tried closing the game so many times but it doesnt fix it at all. Please fix Id love to keep playing your game.,5
good but bad,5
Amazing for a mobile game,5
Good for an anime game,5
I like it.,5
Love it and love dragons. Too much downloading each time.,5
Good game,5
Awesome,5
Ok So at 1st I was sitting here thinking that this game is kind of lame. By as I started to play it and I got past the few tutorials this game offers a lot of gameplay styles and unique features to a mobile game that other games don't offer while at the same time incorporating a few things in other mobile games that we have always loved and enjoyed such as a evened out gacha system and also good graphics the gameplay is very very intriguing and you can delve right into the game and start having fun right away,5
"Whell done i lone download it because it said it from older game from Nintendo, but i ever here of this game, whis u or someone would do a crono trigger game",5
Well designed game,5
Absolute masterpiece,5
👍,5
Best game ever I recommend it to people,5
Overall a good game.,4
"Great music and artwork, not a huge fan of the combat so far tho",3
Awesome story!!,5
A fantastic game to play if you have no life. Can confirm great game.,5
"This game is a lot of fun! It is very detailed, with great graphics and cool characters. I love this game so far.",5
May have too much going on in the building of character. Very Japanese,4
"My favorite new obsession, fantastic music, fantastic game play, and I adore the characters and the stories of each.",5
it's fun and fast pace. ahead of its time,5
So far this is an enjoyable game.,4
Like the story line and gameplay,5
ANIMEEEEE!!!!!,5
It's like $20-30 for a basic 10-pull and there are serious disconnect issues.,3
"Fun game overall, easy and good controls which can be rare for mobile games.",5
"Good game, great concept. Biggest issue is repeatedly getting disconnected when playing co-op on strong network/wifi signal",4
It is good for children Can you make another one,5
Best game ever just is it out on the switch or,5
"The game needs an update, but when I hit ""update"", it just takes me to the store page. There is no way to update the game and there is no way to move forward. Fix your game nintendo.",1
"This is my first time playing a game like this so it is taking some time to get used to. So getting used to everything. The controls throw me off bit but I'm getting used to it and still trying to figure it out lol. Wondering why I have to download each new chapter? It's just little Mb just it makes me feel I'm that far the behind for the game not being out that long. But other than that like the game and story so far, love the graphics.",4
Great,5
Well everything seems good with the game. I LOVE THE MUSIC.,5
Good game,5
Enjoyable; must have.,5
"This game feels nice to play, its fluid, and the controls work. However, it's just not a fun game. Good idea for in game mechanics, poorly executed in a repetitious hack n slash. The characters are all the common tropes and stereotypical nonsense that leaves you not caring what happens in the story.",2
"All around fantastic Mobile game, there's almost too much to upgrade and you get too little resources (without paying) but that's my only flaw so far",5
"Been playing for a day, and I've been enjoying it so far. Graphics and stories are really good",5
Good game,5
It's one of the best phone app games if you don't have a console,5
I like the game but now it keeps saying failed to connect to the server I don't know what to do I need help,5
I love you,5
Great little gem Nintendo has here,5
Fun little game,5
Great but there are some bugs or is just me?,4
good,5
it just a fun game,5
LOVE IT!!!!,5
Great game,5
Good game good graphics and does not over do the microtransactions,5
Cool,5
So far so good. To early to commit to any real opinion. Stay tuned!,5
The game is awesome reminds me of quest 64 but the download times are insane but overall decent,4
"Games gacha seems to be very fair, though they really need to count 5 star wyrmprints separate from heroes and dragons on the pit counter. Other than that gameplay is good, graphics are good, the story is okay.",5
So far excellent game.,5
Beautiful game.,5
Finally a Mobile game I will play to the end 🔔,5
I like the overall game play but it leaves a little bit to be desired in the weapons armour and customization department,4
I like this game better If the story would not considered to be downloaded to move on but other than that the game is amazing,4
"Well made, great music and fun combat with simple controls.",5
"I'd like this game if you didn't have to download each level individually. Loading times aren't ridiculous, but it breaks the flow pretty handily. Other than that I like it. The story is decent, as far as I've seen and the voice acting is pretty good. Plus a some of the art is really gorgeous. Just not a smooth experience. Could use some tweaking.",3
THIS GAME HAS A BOPPIN SOUND TRACK AND I LOVE IT but i wish the controls were better movement wise and the cuteness are a bit laggu but that's ok,5
A Fun Building RPG,4
A very well-rounded rpg game way to go Nintendo!,5
AWESOME,5
Its grrrrrreat,5
"I have to change my opinion. Higher levels require more and more time. Keeping characters levels, Mana circles, teams balanced, dragons lvls and friendship lvls, weapons must be fully leveled up and unbound before you can upgrade, the accessories prints lvled and unbound as well. Be very frugal and save all your wrymstone for the tenfold summon. Also login daily. It's a huge time sink. Just a standard f2p with micro-transactions that are very tempting.",3
Fun game play,5
Freezes constantly,1
Wish shop items were cheaper but great game overall,5
Good game.,4
Great game its beautiful,5
I love how the nice mobile game mechanics work. I espicially love how the plot turns out.,5
The best game ever,5
A little weird but very generous with freebies and the value packs are worth buying. Feels like much less of a total waste of $ than something like Empire and Puzzles.,4
Won't even finish the download.,1
Good and polite,5
Game didnt download,1
Very fun RPG to play on the go,5
Pretty good,5
Awesome,5
Awesome game,4
It's like tales of Symphonia but mobile,4
A game that does every bit to be granblue fantasy. The only difference here is that combat is action oriented instead of turn based. The microtransactions in the game are standard fare for these types of gacha games. If you have patience and save your resources you won't have to worry about the resources needed to summon the heroes you want. Since this is a Nintendo game I can trust this game to be less greedy than the Japanese exclusive gacha games from other companies.,4
"Summoning characters and dragons is too rare. I HATE SUMMONING WYRMPRINTS ITS DEPRESSING. But it's all you ever get! I got all the wyrmite the game will freely offer and never summoned 1 flipping 5 star character. I summoned 2 5 star dragons, but go frigging figure they were the same exact one, off banner too I might add. Absolutely absurd.",2
So far so good in the early stages,4
"Forcing ads to run in HD makes me irritated, as those with slower internet speeds are forced to deal with constant buffer. I denounce this product, and want nothing to do with it or its stupid theme song.",1
Very cool adventure game,5
NICE this game is pretty good for an android game. I mean definitely not one to miss if you're into RPG or Action or pretty much any other game.,5
It was really good but took up to much storage and was a bit laggy. Overall really good game.,5
"I want to play, I have the game downloaded and it keeps saying I need to update it from the app store. There isn't any update.",2
Amazing. Fun!,5
Love it,5
Game kept saying it needed an update but never showed on playstore. Can't play game so can't truly rate anything good about it.,1
Great rpg game,5
Love the art and the story,5
For a game on your phone this is a very detailed game. Graphics are console worthy and it is addictive. Highly recommend this game for anyone,5
Consumes my data,1
"Very addicting, very fun!",5
Overall good. Controls are a little tricky.,4
Ok,5
"The game is very well made. Considering it is a Nintendo game, it doesn't disappoint.",5
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
Poop,5
Awesome,5
Will not download,2
Keep it up. Proud of you.,5
It is a really really good game that has a great story line but can you guys please add more story to it because its super easy and doesn't feel entirely challenging at all,5
So far pretty good,4
"Simply put, this is a very fun and addicting game :D",5
It' so much fun and the voice acting is so well done!,5
Great,5
I think this game is be the best moble game in a few years,5
"It's okay, not perfect but playable.",4
Ah! Great game! Cute guys! 10/10 lamo,5
It's nice!! (Borat voice),5
"Great to see new stuff like this... and the rush to get big labels on the mobile market... would like to see more classics ported to mobile... a nerd cab dream, can't he?",5
Good game,4
It's a cute game like the music it fits the game.,5
"It's a fun game, kills time and its pretty easy. Graphics is great and story is very enjoyable",4
pretty dope. catchy music,4
Make this a show on Netflix plz,5
Fresh take on a very solid game,5
good free time killer.,5
One of the best mobile games yet i really enjoy this game i think other people would love this game.,5
My first time playing and the game is not bad it's great,5
Great Game! I was surprised to see a Nintendo game on here.,5
"Pretty fun, but unfortunately one of my least favorite of Nintendo's forays into mobile gaming. The gacha rate is absolutely terrible for characters, and the gems are actually relatively scarce compared to how much you need to summon. Movement on maps is also an issue, and I constantly get stuck in corners or walk right into a trap because of how finicky the controls are. I wish Nintendo had gone for an actual fixed gamepad, like Honkai Impact 3rd or any of Bandai-Namco's games. I rounded up from 3.5 stars because the art is gorgeous, the story is cute, and the characters are fun. But the gameplay? Sucks so much that I never really want to play.",4
Pretty fun for a gacha type game,4
It's cool homes Like totes legit.,5
Yo,3
The songs are great and the graphics are great,5
The story is compelling and the gameplay and graphics are very good.,5
I love it.,5
Simple and easy to play I also like the ost for this game good job Nintendo,5
Bad controls but I like it,4
"Honestly, this game would be pretty great if it weren't for the insane amounts of lag. Maybe it's just my phone, but holy geez.",3
Not a bad game.,4
Good,5
So cool😇😉😁😁😁😇😁😁,5
So far pretty fun the controls are simple and easy to use,5
Its a good game,5
I absolutely love this game!,5
Amazing,5
"There are things I love about it like... you don't have to spend an obscene amount of money and, in fact, it doesn't seem to aid your leveling much if you do spend. There are things I absolutely hate... the controls when fighting as it auto selects the nearest target. HATE IT. LOATHE IT. Like WHY must it be closest? It means if you are a caster/healer you put yourself in danger. Why can't you select by clicking? It also is VERY hard to go from casting to moving at times in a fight. Also... Another thing that is obnoxious is how it shows your reward but you cannot collect it on that screen... you have to go to the goodie box. It is a time sink. Overall it is a good game with a nice story line and graphics, especially for a phone game. Thirdly... almost forgot... My stylus for my phone only works in a fight- hoped it would improve the controls when trying to tell my character to move and it, instead, casts to get body slammed/killed... please fix where works in entire app?",3
I think this games amazing even if i got to play for a little,5
Toooooo many Wyrmsssss,4
Extremely fun,5
Me like make for Nintendo switch,5
Add fortnite and dragon Ball ledgends to Android,5
Lots of fun,5
I can't load the game. It did the big download and is asking to either auto or manually do my settings and that screen totally locks up and freezes my phone. I really want to try this game! I have heard good things and look forward to a bug fix so I can give 5 stars,2
Great game and amazing graphics,5
"I am blown away by the controls, frame rate, and enveloping story of this game. Definitely Nintendo quality.",5
"Cool game concept and a thoughtful story. Seems to share the same automated dungeon crawler feel with a basic hack and slash/tap hybrid combat system. I'm only just beginning the story, though, so I'm curious to see how development/ combat progresses as my knowledge of the game does.",4
Good gameplay and mechanics,4
"Great graphics, easy one hand control, deep story, too much downloading for every other match or story....",4
Great game. Fun and interesting. Main drawback is the amount of data and having to download every level.,3
Bad ass game yo!!!,5
Best game nice everything,5
I love this game,5
Dragalia lost is one of those types of games that get you hooked up from the start. It has amazing graphics and the story is great. I also liked how they set up the menu and the other things. But I hoped for better controls. The controls are pretty hard to use because you move in one direction you can't turn unless you lift up your finger. Besides that the game is great.,4
"It's just alright. Okay all around (except the story which sucks). It's biggest boon is its devs who have been extremely responsive to user feedback and been extremely generous. It's certainly a significantly improved game from its released but for me, it's just kinda middling",3
This is how you do a free-to-play game right constantly rewarding the player never holding the game's progression to reims other developers can you take notes,5
Good game.,3
awesome,5
Updated like every week. Taging 3+ gigs and counting. Pay to win but without paying im way overpowered. Maybe luck. Otherwise good beautiful anime game,3
I'VE NEVER PLAYED A MOBILE GAME THIS FUN!!!!,5
"Great story, amazing graphics and SOOOO many characters, the team-up possibilities are ENDLESS!!!",5
"Game is great, controls are eh however my biggest issue is getting my game data from my note 4 to my note 9........I have linked my Nintendo account still iss <issues and not starting over day 1 vet",4
Installed it. Said it needs an update. Game auto-closes. Restart app. Same message about update. Repeat.,1
Love it,5
This game is amazing and has great story line,5
Amazing Nintendo,5
It's fun so far.havent gotten too far in,5
Its good,5
It's good but not perfect,5
"""Humans and Dragons pactbound once more!""",5
I'm liking the music alot. And the battle system isn't bad.,5
Good gob,5
"It's was good in the beginning but as you get to the first chapter where you actually play, it keeps downloading data, it too much for me.",3
Love it,5
I have to do this unless it keeps bugging me about it,5
The summoning rates are trash. The grind is way to much for events. The power rankings is not a good reflection of actual difficulty. The co-op could learn something from other games especially when connection is lost or host leaves.,1
It's a good grinding game,5
Takes a bit to get used to but pretty fun once you get it down. Now if only they'd release it worldwide so my friends in other countries can play Co-op with me.,5
I love it,5
it's fun that's all ima ganna say,5
The game is amazing. I have been searching for something that would hold my interest when away from home. For new users keep in mind you will be using quite a bit of data to play so install near wifi and you should be ok. Also the small downloads are not very large however be cautious if you do not have a unlimited plan. If any I had any complaints it would be to have a better explanation before summons as I did not realize right away what I was getting from them. Though that may be my fault as I was in a rush at first,5
Really polished and neat! Amaxifj pop soundtrack by DAOKO! Get this game it's a lot of fun. My only gripe with it right now is that we don't get enough gems and the summon rates for 5 star is really really low. Edit: I had to change it to a 5 star rating cuz the music is just too good! Especially in the current choir event!,5
Any chibi arpg players would love this game Thank you for this game.,5
Really fun game. Love the music and art style,5
"Love the OST, Misete yo🎶",5
👌,5
Needs to stay good,5
Good game,5
Pretty good game deserves a console release.,5
Great,5
Awe Inspiring,5
"Really good game. The events are great and playing with friends is really fun. Bad thing I would say is that it takes way too much space on my phone, but other than that, it's a 5 star game no doubt about it.",5
Poor rates.,1
Lotsa crashing,3
Good,5
"Pretty fun so far, the only drawback is that there's so much downloading",4
Fun Fun Fun!,5
The wrong is stuck in my head...I can't get it out....pray for me...,5
<|°_°|>,5
"It's pretty goood, the voice acting in english isn't bad for dubs entirely, and the ganeplay is fun. Has a nice friendly looking environment. Give it a try.",4
"Not bad Nintendo, not bad at all.",5
The game pay story is awsome just you have to download a lot,5
"Would love to play, , but on the start screen it keeps telling me it requires an update when there isnt one available. Really sucks, I was excited to try it.",1
Amazingly,5
Adorable game; easy to pick up and play.,5
👌👌 the best gave i've ever had the honor of playing!,5
collected too much information. wants the right to collected device and location information which doesnt fly with me. id rather pay for a game and keep my information to myself. our information is worth way more to them than a few bux worth of digital gaming. shame.,1
Is a game that is really fun,5
Very fun,4
Download it. Well worth playing.,5
enjoyable pocket RPG that's not locked behind a pay wall.,5
ITS LITTY XDDDDDDDDD,5
It doesn't work at all. It keeps telling me to update but there is no update!,1
It's really perfect but just something wrong with the summoning part because I can't get no characters for some reason and that's the bad part. What do you thing?,5
"a great free fantasy game for those looking for some story and some fun. Pros: controls for a mobile rpg are great, the graphics are cute, and the story concept is great Cons: The storyline embellishing with small story interactions based on individual characters earned from the large pool of characters could prove to be a bit overwhelming and instead of enriching the world adds a tedious element, it would be ni e to see more animated scenes as well",5
It's cool and cute,5
This game is one of the best I've played.,5
I love this game,5
This game is legit. I hate micro transactions but in a game as well designed and detailed as this it fits into the flow of the game and they earned the right to be a part of the experience. I rarely give micro transaction style games a chance but Nintendo has earned the respect from the gaming community for years and they know how to deliver a complete product and be thoroughly cautious about how they represent their brand. So far this is a very enjoyable experience and I'm loving the new characters and story for the first time. This is by far a damn near perfect game so far. It pretty much meets almost all the criteria for what a good mobile game should look like. Even though I don't like micro transactions I understand the way companies are leaning to this form of game concept but if you're going to be that type of company at least make the game feel like you actually cared about the quality in it. The only thing this game could use is like maybe Bluetooth controller options because the movement is alright but I guess for a mobile game it's better than most. I may just need to adjust the sensitivity in the settings but other than that everything else is nice.,5
My phone is a few years old so it lags a little but other than that it's been a really good game for being a free mobile game,5
Enjoyable fantasy rpg and time killer!,5
This game is great. It's really fun and has a great story. I honestly love this game so much! Probably the best animie RPG out there,5
Guess what? I can't read Japanese! So why do you insist on sending me game notifications in Japanese??,1
"Turned out way more better than expected atleast in my opinion,...",5
I played this game for a while but it gives way to many duplicates so I dont want to try for Summons anymore,3
Too many ads cant play game. Trash,1
Great game,5
"Fun game, 5* drops too rare though",4
Yoop,5
Pretty fun.,4
The combat is pretty easy but really fun!!,5
It's good RPG but could be better,3
Pretty good,5
This game is pretty good but also kinda taxing on my phone. Would recommend.,4
I love this game so far! The only problem is the phone I'm running it on.,5
"Love the characters, great story, awesome events.",5
Fun,5
"One of the best hero collector games from Q4 in 2018. Definitely give this game a try for the fun combat, colorful character color palette, and DAOKO soundtrack.",5
Awesome,5
"Great and very fun. Even though it's a gatcha game, you can still play free easily. They give you lots of free materials often.",5
Fun game,5
"Fun game but can't install latest update, please help",1
ZETHIAAA!!!,5
Good,5
I liked it a lot.,4
Fun,5
"After completing the windwyrm's den area your supposed to get Cleo right. I didn't get her, what happened",4
Coooooooooooool,5
Keeps telling me to update when it's already the latest version on Google Play.,1
you should make it able to put costumes on the characters,5
Loved it,5
the cheesy anime tone of the game is a little off throwing but who doesn't like a action rpg w/ a cool dragon,5
Love it,5
"It was great now it sucks bad, cant enjoy playing no more",1
Foolproof,5
I'm enjoying the game so far.,5
"Wonderful art. Solid controls. Think Fire Emblem, but with stronger emphasis on controlling specific heroes instead or strategy. Never realized that a mobile game could offer so much.",5
Easy to play but room to be challenging and enjoyable.,5
GG,5
Game doesn't even work loads and right before it is done loading IT CRASHES,1
Fun,5
The game is amazing but some of the controls are a bit buggy,5
Great game good job nintendo,5
Great game would highly recommend to others😁,5
"The game is great graphics are great the only thing I took a start off was control, it's good but I think it needs just a little tweek. I definitively recommend it!!",5
Fun,5
It's good,5
Original and fun,5
"Easy to forget this is a Nintendo game when it feels exactly like every cashgrab cheap gacha game before it, nothing special, nothing new",1
Love the storyline and characters,5
Holy Lord. Literally an additional download was needed for every thing. Want to play chapter 1 an additional download is needed. Want to see your stats please download more. Want to do anything please download. It had a massive download in the beginning how in the world does it have more to download every day. You can't even get to the game without a new download every 2 seconds.,1
Good game. It's just a little slow at times.,4
Games should not be sending me notifications.,1
Love the game,5
"Amazing and fun, awesome animation and great graphics, 10 out of 10 would recommend",5
LOVE NINTENDO AND THIS IS THE NINTENDO MOBILE BEST GAME.,5
I loved it so much!!!,5
Very well made,5
"The best game I have, considering you can play live multuplayer is just, it's great. Although, sometimes the controls slip up once in a while, but besides that, I generally enjoy this game.",5
I love it,5
"Dragalia lost is such a fun game! The characters are fun and actually have depth to them! The combat is a little weird at first but now I think it works perfectly for how the game is! Plus my favorite aspect which is the dragons! All of the dragons are sweet and also have depth to them! O cant lie, this whole game is awesome and very time consuming which is something I love! Time killing that doesnt feel like I'm wasting time!",5
Would not download,1
"It's fun, but it's too soon to make a complete opinion. Just getting out of the beginning.",5
Its pretty good,5
Good,5
Pretty fun game. Controls take some getting used to but the music and graphics are excellent,4
"Very addicting and very fun, good graphics. Good job Nintendo!!!",5
Great game.,5
"Seems like a game from the Wii. The music, graphics, and gameplay suggests that time and dedication was placed to make the game. Really enjoying it.",5
5 stars,5
It is so cool,5
It's a fun experience,5
"Good mechanics I think Nintendo did an excellent job on this one, and it isn't too in app purchase heavy like most modern games and nothing is locked behind pay walls like they did with super Mario run",5
This is a great gatcha and co-op makes the experience even better!,5
Porkchop,5
Cleo best girl,5
Downloaded the game. Opened it Needed a update immediately clicked to update No need for a update.... Fix plz. Then I'll change the reviews,1
Fun side scroller beat em up dungeon crawler with built in waifu collector.,5
It takes forever to download everything but once you do it's pretty fun and the graphics are cute. The story is pretty dynamic too.,4
Great music and graphics and the cut scenes with voice acting were a nice surprise! Already a little annoying with the multiple downloads and new data for ever mission needs to be downloaded,4
Great moblie game.,5
Fun game,5
best game ever,5
Worst controls of any game I've ever played,2
Love this game.,4
It's to be expected from Nintendo but the amount of voice acting in this game astounds me.,5
Great play and storyline,5
Typically I love this game but I cant get on. I've tried logging in all morning but its. white wash and wont load so I cant play please fix for 5 stars!,4
Countless hours have been poured into this game. I can't reccomend enough.,5
It's very fun,5
Fun,5
"Very cute game, simple enough",5
This is a good game if people love anime so good work and do more updates,5
"Super cute game. Typical mobile rpg elements like summoning, but not horribly detrimental to the game or story.",5
I wish it had the option for joystick controls.,4
The touch to move is a little buggy but other wies very good game,5
Game play is simple and fun.,4
"I think the game is good. The characters are a bit simple and there is room for improvement there. Besides it being very cisgender heterosexual normative, it's not bad. The game play is great, it's addictive and the music is amazing.",4
"The gatcha rate is pretty bad. While most games guarantee something good for a mass buy in, this game only guarantees a 4 star, and more often than not it is a power up card rather than a character. The 5 star rate is terrible. The current story is short and you soon get to the point where you grind just for the sake of grinding.",2
First few days of playing are entertaining and you can steadily progress. Then you hit a pay wall where you either spend to continue progression or stagnate and have to slowly grind the same levels and events over and over to keep up.,2
Best game ever,5
its good but it be cool if you made a show on Netflix,5
This game is fun and I liked it,4
Amazing Game,5
My peepee hurt,5
Love this game.,5
"Game is fantastic. The mission, though copied from a mechanic side, are rich and new each time.",5
"I really like the game, is pretty and beautiful. Also the music is awesome but when i got through some leves in chapter 2 the co-op mechanic unlocked and focers you to create a room and try it, the problem is that it never stops loading, ive tried closing the game and even forcing it to stop, but when i open it again it focers me again and doesnt let me do anything else. Im really looking foward for this game, so thats why i came here to read others people review and im not the only one who has this problem. This game just come out, so its normal that it still have some little probles here and there, so i really hope you guys fixs all this and thanks",5
Awesome,5
Amazing music. Needs some improvements on the controls to be a perfect 5 imo.,4
Excessive downloading just to play... should download full game when you install it,2
Hands down to the writers and the sound development team. Need better controls but i think thats just how it is. Pretty impressive from nintendo. Apart from the bad rates. Id say its a game i would play everyday,5
Dont play this game. You will get useless 5* wyrmprints instead of useful stuff,1
"Although the storyline animations are disappointing, everything else is great. The music is surprisingly excellent.",5
"I really like this game. It is really fun and has immersive story telling. But, omg. So many frickin downloads. Yes you can do batch downloads, but my Gatos, so many frickin downloads just to keep playing the game!",4
"Pretty polished, traditional gatcha.",4
It's a nice built game. Farmable loot is my fave. Has in app purchases but not really necessary.,5
I think overall it's a really good app,4
Amazing game,5
Amazing,5
"It's actually pretty good and fair for a gatcha game, but too many downloads too often which is far from ideal for a mobile game (unless you have WiFi all the time that is)",5
值五星!!! 4* 同 5* 加埋有大約20%左右， 咁高機率賭得過呀， 大家可以試下抽， 就知道實際卻遠低於期望值。 遊戲內抽池系統需要大幅改良， 分池，機率，保底，仲有大把方法嘛。 個啲高戰力睇唔起低戰， 話乜Q打咗咁耐高級超級呀， 係度掛機，入場算俾面啦。 搞到啲人寧願開分身小號開場掛機， 死咗主控都願意用小號繼續打啦。 宜家入場幾分鐘先等得齊人， 仲唔改體力/羽毛機制。 協力大部分時間， 一係訊息一嚟斷線， 唔係就房主變單人mode， 其他三個直接跳場， 疾一疾又斷。 合作太少， 公司旗下咁多遊戲， 竟然只合作一次， 仲要得一個角色。 有玩過其他既話， 就知道遊戲內容只用其他遊戲角色， 太少原創角色。 遊戲平衡度一面倒， 完全唔知絕望淚水既價值。 一隻三星角升到五星全環十幾萬露， 五星角全環只需要7萬幾。 你可以話至少覺醒過兩次， 但強度都係比五星差，差勁多。 咁既平衡度真係唔係露啦。 大部分活動係靠刷分， 完全無技術可言。 團體戰直接龍化打， 單人boss auto 都夠。 真龍等你齊 530，卡同龍先入門。,5
Coolsauce.,5
"Amazing game with a ton of mechanics, NO ADS!!! Extremely rewarding for free to play!!!! Would have to be your primary game because it offers so much. I love it but I am invested in other games already. Love it, 5 stars all around, just cant commit to the time required to fully appreciate this bountiful content. Highly recommended!!",5
Fun game,5
"Game is broken on start up on pixel3. It looks into an ""game must be updated"" screen at start screen. Clicking update takes you to Google play where no update is available. Can't get passed update screen. Fix it, I'll fix review.",1
A few control issues. And not being able to speak with your friends in game kinda takes a away . Some redundancy.. but love it. If you aren't playing it .. u should,4
Love the game. Well i like most gacha game in general. The only problem i have with the game is the controls.,4
Fun. Game.,5
owo many dragon children to adopt,5
"Gacha system is the worst I only have 1 5* while plying a month, wrymight kills the game, all the grinding for nothing, the luck just was not there",3
Good game. Decent rates. worth a try. controls can get clunky.,4
"A great game, but definitely will need something good to play it on, or 3D models will be blackened out. I switched to playing it on my tablet over my phone, and it plays great.",4
"Great game thus far in every aspect graphics, story and art all on point. Nintendo is killing it keep up the good work.",5
It's not bad. But you have to download too much too often. Voices try to turn on again after updating. It's very data and download heavy.,4
"Events are fun, characters are neat. Game needs to be less expensive though if you want to buy stuff. Almost $30 for a 10 pull is insane",3
"Great game, nice character design and fun gameplay",5
The menu is too crowded. Game play gets kind of repetitive. Just about grinding for upgrades. Very nice visuals and artwork. Not being able to download passively is annoying.,3
Solid game. Grind you can expect from a Cygame games. Now only if they can find a way to make stamina suck less.,4
Great game luck has been with me so far,5
Really cute and fun gatcha game. Love that I can gather a group of friends together if I get stuck and they can help.,5
I love dragons,5
"Amazing game that has that Nintendo polish, awesome characters, and very little push for micro transactions. Story was pretty quick need more end game activities",5
Amazing gameplay and various characters and types with crafting system and good story.,5
if you didnt name your main character shulk you suck,3
Fun characters made me Feel things,5
Loving it,5
This game is great. I genuinely enjoy playing and almost no need for in game transactions beyond any I want to make,5
Iust fun all around,5
sure one big download file but real fun when it finishes,5
"This game is so amazing on almost every detail their is so much to read on story, character, dragons,wrymprints and events like just love it",5
"A very good game for a cell game. Decent RPG elements. The only complaint is the same I have for most cell games, in that there is a loot box system in place. That said, it feels easy to gain the currency in game for said boxes and so I've never felt pressured into paying for one.",4
copy of white cat project,1
Really fun and great game!,5
Great game with minor bugs and delay on Android. I have enjoyed almost every second with it since launch. keep it the good work!,5
It's a fun game. I am kind of addicted.,5
This game mega awesome,5
"Great story and music, overall very fun and addictive",5
Its Gud,5
A wonderful action RPG on the go. It only lacks gamepad support.,5
Great Game :D,5
I love the music and the story is amazing,5
Great,5
I thought I would get the game then delete it after 10 minutes of playing but it was and is way to addictive to get rid of,5
"While Dragalia Lost uses the run of the mill ""gacha"" formula it rewards it's user for playing with in-game currency and upgrade items. Gameplay is addictive and acts as a constant feedback loop: the more you play the more you are rewarded. Helps that there has been non-stop events to keep the game interesting. Give it a try, but know that the game revolves around in-app purchases; completely optional but encourages you to give into temptation.",5
Great f2p!! Awesome action adventure game with instanced missions and boss fights!,5
AWESOME,5
I love this game and cant wait till till the next story,5
"Its a great addictive game, reminds me of 'corporal rune story' forgive my misspelling, its an older game that came out on mobile devices i loved the game and it got shut down",5
Interesting story and fun grinding.,5
One of the few mobile games to grip me for a long time,5
Love the game. The game play and graphics are as close to a game console as a phone game can get. Cant stop playing,5
Absolutely phenomenal music and gameplay,5
Overall it's a fun and great game especially for a mobile game. The developers are very generous in terms of in game products and necessities to advance making it more enjoyable. My only major complaint is the controls.,4
Beautiful and Fun!,5
Takes to much space,5
I love this gacha game! It's tons of fun and I don't feel screwed by the gachapon.,5
Great game just kills the battery,5
"Great game, changed my opinion on what a mobile game can be quality wise.",5
"This game is addicting and so much fun, I'm enjoying it",5
Game is getting on tedium with gatcha pulls that have ridiculous low chances of pulls and guaranteed ways of getting good heroes is through real life cash,3
"Simple but not too simple that its not interesting. The little stories on the side keep u interested in the characters and make u wanna keep playing so the full story unfolds. I don't ever leave reviews, but I really enjoy playing this on my down time 😊💛💜🧡",5
its fun but requires so much room on your phone. Seems worth it though. #awesomesauce,5
BEST GAME EVER,5
Awesome,5
To many downloads have to do a download every day,5
It really great,5
Great,5
"Dragalia has a driving storyline, a intuitive combat style, upgrades for days and even a kingdom that you can build as you gather the resources! There is so much more I love about it you will just have to see for yourself! I say 10/10",5
Great game.,5
This game has good animation and fine storytelling though I wish there was more animated cutscenes,5
"Great addicting game, the lore is fantastic!",5
Gg,5
"You don't need 5* to clear content. If you can't, there's a player skill issue with your phone.",5
This is an engaging game with an interesting story.,5
Fun time waster,5
"Fun, graphicaly good. Only complaint is the paywalled diamonds.",5
Need to be able to tap on enemies to attack to hard to stop fighting to turn around to attack behind your self,4
"Just an amazing game playing with my fiance has been great and sharing our summon victories as we play. It is a fun grind game by yourself, but it has been a blast playing with someone.",5
"Great story, art work, and game play. Plenty of fun without having to spend any real money.",5
I've never been this addicted to a mobile game,5
it's pretty dang fun,5
Good for Final fantasy record keeper fans but a more action based combat. Easily the best game RN for mobile,5
Worst gacha rates in history. For Nintendo to set up such a predatory system is a shame. A bunch of crooks leeching off of a three gacha system. Disgusting.,4
The game is fun. The game play is great. Sometimes my bad luck makes me lose interest.,4
"Lots to do, a fun game with a solid grind love it",5
awesome!!!,5
"Great game, I play all the time. Only thing I don't like is the extra story segments. Its a great story though. The missions are just to short to have so many interruptions.",4
good,5
Good game,5
👍,5
Fun game would give it a five stars but I have to download every level,4
Great game all around!,5
Fun time waster that you can play with friends. Controls in movement are the only thing that gets a little frustrating but its not game breaking. Gatcha chance for ssr characters are crazy as usual but luckly you can make do without them to progress in the main story and events. GBF and FateGO players will be familier with the essense cards system & party side stories. It even has some town building/management elements.,4
Decent way to pass time,4
Outstanding,5
Great game right now it's my favorite,5
Great game just don't like the controls IAM more of a Dpad buttons,5
Game takes too long to download additional files. I left it alone for 30 mins on a 5Mbps connection and it only got halfway,1
Amazing!!!!!,5
Is a very good,5
Simple controls great graphics awesome game,5
"It's fun so far, if draining a bit on the battery.",5
Good,5
It is a very great game I love it,5
Amazing game easy to understand easy to play love the game,5
It's Fun and Entrancing,5
Not bad,5
Remind me of my first time playing a jrpg game. Love it!,5
Cool,5
Good game. Developer communicates issues and addresses them quickly. Rates on summons could be better.,4
This is my game right now,5
"Good game, not the worst gatcha mechanics",5
Quite a good title from Nintendo. People need to give this new IP a chance.,5
Some movement mechanics can be frustrating but overall it's basically like playing a Manga! They have lots to do to keep busy and the prizes and events are really fun and fair! Nintendo did a great job in my opinion. Some of their apps have been money hungry but this is pure gameplay! Just what Nintendo should always be known for!,5
It's quite a fun little game,4
So fun. Very cute designs. Love the game.,5
"I love this game so much! I'm so glad you left it open to be able to change the VA language because I find the English dub a bit lacking in perceived authenticity. I really love the soundtrack too, your partnership with Daoko was a total payoff! This is my favourite mobile rpg (the only game of any sort that beats it is Mystic Messanger and that's an otome) <3 .•°`\(=^_^=)/`°•.",5
Great game play. I enjoy this game a lot. It's a nice game to play when I need a break from doing homework and work.,5
It is cute. Has a nice story line and is easy to follow along,5
One of the best games I've ever played on android beautiful graphics and great game play,5
Really good,5
It's a very well made game with good graphics a good story and plenty of content to play. Grinding for loot isn't easy but it isn't tedious either,5
Hey thats pretty good,5
It sucks more than a vacuum,1
Awesome,5
It's so fun but there seems to be a lot of wind types,5
Well done with story telling and adds a new flavor with games.,5
almost good,5
"It's has a lot of potential to be a fun game, only cut short heavily by absurd and restrictive grinding, difficult controls, and UI that I just can't get used to at all.",3
It stop downloading when it's in 99.98 percent and can't download that's gay,1
I have a feeling that Nintendo is going to take over mobile games in the next 2-3 years,5
One of thr6ee best games I've played!,5
Great graphics but hard to control movement or attack.,5
"Control is a bit clunky. But, after all, this is still a very well made game in other aspects. Definitely worth your time.",5
so far so groovy keepnup the good work,5
"Awesome and addictive, really fun to play",5
Graphics look great and does help pass the time,5
Im installing now so we see later what i rate and problems i have (should work good and there are a few other people that use this model phone),3
Fun enough if you know what your getting into. Progression seems a good pace. Very polished. They are very good at addressing bugs and patching them,5
"Failed to extract resources needed by Il2CPP error, won't start on Nexus 9 tablet",1
Great game very addicting,5
Great action RPG with co-op. Characters are well designed and written and are fun to play. Might be the best game on mobile.,5
Excellent game through and through,5
"When you hear them speak and move and fight it has passion. You can literally feel the people in the game the heros spirits. It just so amazing how well done this was. This game reminded me of the good old days Of Zenonia 3 and 4. This game is beyond my expectations and probably even beyond everyone else. This game is one that you can never find anywhere and cant be duplicated, it's a one of a kind. I hope to see more story's and cool things to come from this game. That k you so much for making this amazing Master Piece. 😁",5
Pretty good way to kill time. Nintendo teaming up with Cygames is a team made in heaven. Budget and quality of Nintendo and the mobile game know how of Cygames,5
Pretty interesting so far. Looking forward to seeing more.,5
Expensive if you choose to pay for extra but fun and cool summons,5
it's a nintendo published cygames game... what more do you want?,5
Character progression has been made less of a chore and they have been good about QoL changes. Clearly they play their own game or at least listen to the community.,4
love playing this game,5
"Very fun gameplay, nice story to get into, with a long list of characters to love, and an awesome soundtrack. On top of all that, developed by a team that cares about its playerbase.",5
"A great Gacha game by Cygames, as always. Very generous as well, and so far hasn't had any stupid ideas that keep getting out of control (like Fire Emblem Heroes). The controls could use some work, but it's a blast so far. The best part is everyone is viable, and the devs listen to feedback. It used to take a lot longer to grow your units but they've made many improvements based on our feedback.",4
AWESOME GAME,5
"Excellent graphics, awesome story that I've seen so far, engaging combat, easy to learn/hard to master upgrade system. Finally a mobile game I can enjoy for a long time!",5
"It's a great game that's easy to get into. The game does have low rates, but it's not absolutely terrible to the point that you have to pay to complete content. Devs are open to response and any errors the players report are seen and they work towards improving our experience with every update.",5
"Fun, well crafted, designed and written.",5
"This game is pretty amazing, and this comes from someone who hates systems that involve slot machine summons. I'm pretty impressed and looking forward to more!",5
"Awesome graphic with a lot things to keep you playing for long time. The game it self is easy to understand but take time to master all your characters. It a must DL if you fully like adventure, dragons, and awesome looking characters!!!",5
"Decent game, should of had more gifts for players during the release. The one hand game play is a good idea, but needs work. Like with most Gotcha/Dungeon raider game the UI is very clustered.",4
"Was amazing at first.... Then it became grindy and so expensive... Five star wyrmprints are such a let down. Now the game fails to connect to the server for over 24 hours despite removing cache or uninstalling/reinstalling... Goodbye forever, Dragalia. You had so much promise.",2
Best game ever!!,5
It's a cool fun and awesome game 🎮,5
"I really enjoy the gameplay. It's pretty smooth, and the character art is very nice! Well made game so far!",5
Not very good. You cant play it for a long time. Gets boring,1
a lot of action very good,4
It's a fun game with good graphics and and the controls are smooth,5
Amazing design.. great story and tons of things to do,5
decent so far,5
I stinking love this game,5
Glitchy when network is congested or weather blocks the signal. Needs a data handling upgrade for all platforms,4
War games and Nintendo yay,5
Good so far,4
Few hours in. Awesome so far.,5
It's got a really cute intro music and my son loves to watch it play out. The story is very good for an Android,5
Dope game,5
So far my favorite game on a mobile.,5
It's so much fun!,5
Amazing!,5
The game its great! But it would be even better with controller support,5
I think it's a really good game but their is a lot of text dialog wish more of it was voice acting,4
"Great game couple errors but for the most part, a great game",3
Too much storage needed,1
I love the artwork and the game and I love the play through I just really like the,5
I expected nothing less from a Nintendo sponsored game,5
Dooooppeee,5
It's fun adventuresome and challenging also in love the little chibis,5
"An addicting game with wonderful characters, beautiful art, and staff that care about catering to the fans. Great whether you're F2P or a whale.",5
Awesome graphics,5
It great,5
"Love it so far, good voice acting, good story and overall fun.",5
Great Game,5
"This game is awesome! The graphics, the storyline just outstanding! 😃😆😃😯😂😄",5
This game is amazing!!! I think it would be a great 3ds game or Nintendo switch game as well!,5
"Been really hooked and enjoying the game so far,awesome!",5
Sometimes the character attacks in the wrong direction.,4
Pretty game so far you,5
Love it Very fun and addictive Story is very intreaging,5
"Hm, seems interesting.",5
Bad azz lol,5
"Lots of fun. Buisness model is fair. Story is kind of average. Gameplay is too easy from the start, but it picks up a bit.",4
Loving the game so far! No problems yet on my new Samsung Note 9! Game has a very arcade feel to it as if I were at an arcade. Controls are simple and straightforward. Not to many toggles. Although it can be very difficult to dodge enemy attacks without something such as a separate dodge/evade control mechanism. Good thing for healer roles!,5
Cool game,5
"This is hands down the best rpg/gacha format for modern mobile games. I see people posting here saying it's extremely pay to win, but I've not yet spent a single cent from day one and have had multiple multi-summons. It's made possible by their frequent events and the amount of ""gems"" they hand out during them as well as login rewards. The mechanics can register poorly at times and they're not very deep by any means. But the game and it's characters are very fun, even if at times you're pushing out a grind. It takes some time, for sure, but it's definitely not p2w. Especially when if you look in your inventory I'm sure you'll find stamina boosters out your ears after a week or so. Overall it's simple and fun to play.",5
Pretty fun. Like Secret of Mana meets Brave Frontier. I haven't unlocked co-op yet but I imagine that's when the real fun starts. Still fun solo. Story seems like it could get good but too early to tell.,5
"Amazing, very polished.",5
I like it,5
"Super fun, simple combat.",5
This is very similar to Ff7 style of play....Very addicting...great story line....if you like mmorpg's you will love this game...I cannot emphasize enough that this story line is amazing!,5
Not bad and the story pretty good,5
Game is easy to learn and detailed. Simple controls.,5
"Great story and gameplay, I would recommend this game to anybody that loves action/adventure games.",5
It supposed to be killing dragons,5
Definitely going to be a really fun and entertaining game. Only just started but I am liking the story a lot (which seems to be a big part of the game) and the combat is fun. Graphics are also pretty cool very large download though,5
"Fun and easy to play. Good graphics and cool characters, plus you get to become a dragon....what else do you need?",5
I do like the game and all but I can't always keep it on my phone. LOL. There's always some game that I want to replay again. XD but this game is pretty good too!,5
Easy to play and better than most RPGs,5
Games was so work get weapon and stuff to higher up,1
Great game. It's really fun to play and it has a nice story. I only have one real problem and that is how bad the AI is.,4
Pretty entertaining. Though I personally don't like the movement system but that's just me,5
keep on saying doesnt have internet connection whereas im already connected to a stable wifi. need quick fix🙅‍♂️,1
Great game great story easy controls,5
"I just started playing this tonight, but I love it. The art is beautiful and for a phone game the battle system is pretty fun, dialog is great. It's such a huge game. There's a lot to it for it being a phone game. Love the cut scenes and voice acting. Super addicting and fun with a great storyline.",5
Two thumbs up!!!!,5
"It has one of the best devs, who are always transparent with bugs, provide quick feedback and fixes, and care deeply about their player base. This would be enough for me to rate this game highly. The fact that it is such a great well polished game means I am more than happy to support and share it with friends.",5
What could be a great game is ultimately marred by shameful exploitation of summons through a proliferation of undesirable pity-rate breakers (Wyrmprints).,1
use too much battery.,1
Better then what Diablo eternal will be,4
"One of the best mobile games I've ever played, the controls are a bit of a pain due to the size of the screen, and the game is quite large for a mobile game, but it is extremely fun and better that a lot of consol games I've played.",5
"I got a really good gatcha pull with the starter rewards, so now I have to play the game, lol",5
"Required multiple downloads upwards of five minutes with nothing to do while waiting but watch a repeating video multiple times. The graphics aren't nearly as good as I hoped, they look pretty boring to be honest. Slide-to-move controls that are hard to work with. Also has a very bland text display, and you have to wait for them to stop talking to hit next on the text.",2
Awesome game.,5
Thanks Nintendo. Good game,5
"Great quality for a mobile game. Nice cast of characters, the gacha is definately appealing in this one",4
"The game is very fun to play for an hour or two each day. Cygames continually improves the game based on player feedback. If you like action RPGs with an anime style that's well polished, Dragalia Lost is the game for you.",5
I think that the level should be a little bit longer before you get to the boss other than that it's really good and I can't wait to continue playing more and I don't usually leave reviews on games even on some games I like but it's really good,4
Awesome,5
Game is so addictively fun!,5
"Fun concept, good graphics. Runs choppy on my device and drains my battery. Uninstall.",3
lt is asome i knew it when I saw it,5
"Aside from frame rate issue during some sections, the game gives off an good first impression",4
I love the animation and coloring of this game. It's just what I've been looking for.,5
"This is the coolest phone game I have ever played. And I hate most phone games. I have two, and one is this one.",5
The downloading takes a very long time before you can play it again,1
It is one of the best anime games in the world.💎💎😘😘😘😀😀😊😊😻😻,5
"Very fun, addicting game. Gameplay is nice!",5
A fun time waster with an RPG story and endless upgrades. Be warned the story leaves off on a cliff hanger when you finish the main campaign.,5
I like but the only thing is you have to download data every mission,4
Love it,5
"Never short on content, good response from the devs about community feedback, and great graphics",5
I like the game so much many going to play it now,5
It's lit.,5
DL is awesome. Very fun and easy to get into.,5
"After the first day it got really boring to play. And then they added the new pack of people, and it didn't help with the level of boring",1
It's awesome and addictive,5
"I love it but the app is so big if I have to keep downloading any more things I will run out of data. Please please please make the game save more data. I love the game , really. Please please please make it save more data, please.",3
"Haven't been able to access the server, tried several times on different occassions. You would think that two major companies would be able to accomplish something that even indie developers usually manage to do, but I guess not. Expect bad reviews if you release a game before it's stable and bug-free.",1
This is a fun gacha game. The devs are pretty transparent on fixes and currently they are pretty generous.,5
The reason I gave it 4 is because in the beginning it takes WAAAAYY to long to load. Overall very very good.,4
I love vertical game screenplay. This one packs it and more!,5
"This is absolutely wonderful. The art style, characters, back stories, main story, combat, it is just amazing. I had to delete it before the new campaign update because my phone is terrible and worse with storage or I would continue to play.",5
I just love Nintendo and Cygames.. I love how the team is working so hard on making the game greater :) Its always good when you listen to us and you guys are very generous!,5
Nintendos games are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Loved it,5
"This game is amazing in every way great cutscenes, adventure, easy controls, music with vocal lyrics, overall visuals and great leveling system. My only concern is the Gatcha could be better percentage. The only downfall of the game is the stamina system, shouldn't be there for this type of game. I think it should be open, Nintendo could even make a paid version to get rid of all that just like Mario Run. Final Fantasy Opera Omnia, does that it's completely free and they doing great still a popular game to this day with no stamina system, I believe that this game could be too. Overall addicting game.",5
Its cool,4
I downloaded the game and almost played it... Then I realized it's a mobile game that seems free until you get to end game content after weeks of playing then realize you stand zero chance unless you spend actual cash on the game. Respect yourself and don't play mobile games kids ffs.,1
My Review for this game Please Read this if you are a fan or work for the company. I've been playing this since the release date and so far it is a very fun game what makes this unique is the main menu I just love the music and the character animation and voices but probably my biggest complaint is that the summons are kinda difficult to get going because playing for hours you are not guaranteed to get any good character I just wished that it was a bit easier also what I really want to see in the future is a global chat room to talk to players about events/summons or even a guild option to make other then all that I highly recommend giving this a try it has gotten a lot better then it was on the 1st day my rating will be 9/10 keep up the awesome work and bring us more events and maybe collaborations 🙌👏,5
I love it I like to see some anime characters in there like Fairy Tail and ther dragon's,5
Awsome,5
downlode is to much. and take to much space,3
"Pretty damn good and fun game! Very clean graphics, nice sfx and music, easy controls, beautiful artwork and a nice mixture of both action rpg with kingdom building. But, takes up A LOT of space. Expect every new stage to be a download. Small at first, but with all the events and updates, it starts to take a toll on you. Especially if you have other games of the similar type. It makes you decided which ones to keep or delete.",4
"It's like having a triple a rpg in your pocket, interesting characters and fun game play can't wait to play more",5
"Gacha systems, yes, but very smooth gameplay, amazing follow up on feedback from the devs so far, and nothing has been difficult to the point that you feel like you have to pay to keep up or anything.",5
Awesome,5
"This game is awesome, I just wish the awkward, clunky system of downloading cutscenes was different. Uses a lot of space on your phone, but if you can get it to work, it is a pleasant experience with fun progression.",4
The graphics are great,5
Fun so far,5
It's going great,5
Can not recover dara,1
"It's nintendo they make great things, you really can't go wrong",5
Wonderful music and intricate gameplay,5
I never know what to say in these reviews I always think if I wriye something short its gonna seem fake lol. I do like the game though its fun all your characters have special abilities and you can play it with one hand. The game does however require additional downloads after the initial so just make sure your playing around Wi-Fi,5
Shallow diablo like. Nice if you like throwing money at nintendo.,2
"Incredible voice acting, easy controls, and easy grinding",5
Amazing addicting game,5
Love this game,5
I love the graphics and the gameplay is easy enough. For once a game where I want to read the story instead of just skip ahead!,5
"One of the best games I have played on mobile. Devs are very receptive to the community, and compensate well. It has no where to go but up.",5
"I havent even played, BuT I love dem dragons.",5
Great game. 😁,5
This game is great by qaulity and peformance and somewhat challenging,5
Great game so far looking forward to the rest,5
Too many downloads that take hours to complete.,2
SUPER GREAT GAME,5
"If you see a mobile game with autoplay or battle, it's not a game. Don't waste your time on this.",2
so far i am liking the game also it seems like the developers actually listen to their players so that automatically makes the game better,5
"Figured out the co-op server issue on my own. The worst thing about this game is the pull rates on heroes and dragons, BUT if you are willing to invest resources, you can upgrade heroes to 5* anyway. Even if you don't, you should have no trouble completing current content with well-upgraded and well-geared characters of each element, or even just heroes in the fire-water-wind trio since light vs dark is a double-edged sword.",4
Not into the whole typical jpn made dramatic material entirely. To much effort placed in area's that dont really count as an actual game. Cinematic's although a good show can be enjoyable but when you make a game with overly exaggerated cinematic's it becomes apparent. Jpn made games these days don't always seem to be anything than a horrible dramatic show for the worse generation ever.,1
I think it's amazing n every one should try it out,5
"Great game! A bit slow in some cutscenes unless you turn down the graphics, but overall it's an amazing game.",5
Please make an anime from this game,5
"I love it! 😍❤ the voices are awesome!!!! But I wish you could make the characters more like in the video, realistics!!!! Please!😫🙏❤ awesome Dragons! ❤🐲",5
Really fun game,5
pretty good game,5
Good game with lots of polish,5
Really the way u can control your character and evade im looking forward to playing more,5
More fun than playing with my dong,5
That game is great and story is simple yet fantastic fun and funny graphics and controls are simple yet great. This is a must download for rpg fans.,5
Great game..,5
Not bad mobile game controls need abit of tweeking fun overall,4
Loved it,5
Humans and dragons...pactbound once more.,5
"Fantastic game play, super addictive. A must play game!",5
🔥🔥,5
What the heck anymore one,1
In the early game the story is broken up by tutorial bits and the game requires a lot of downloads for each and every little bit but that keeps the game file from being clunky.,4
I feel the creator's could have layered in all character getting dragons equipped to them. A mid or late stage unlock at highest levels. They get incorporated into every character too quick. All of my heroes had dragons before we fought the first one in the quest and I didn't even have the starting dragon in my optimized lineup.,4
The movement controls are slightly annoying but it's otherwise very enjoyable,4
great to have you in my life,5
"This game is not bad at all, art work is fantastic as expected by Nintendo. I feel this game has very much room for improvement, if anything a good way to get an outlook on future mobile device games.",5
Pretty addicting,5
"Great game but large memory eater and you can't even transfer the game to your DS card because when playing co-op the game gets stuck in error. Regardless, a fantastic game.",5
"I belive this game deserves 5 stars easily. Tight controls, fun combat, and a good story.",5
Excellently designed game,5
Amazing game and story!,5
Beautiful graphics,5
I lof it,5
"The story is good so far and for a mobile game it seems to have decent depth, just can't stand the thousand different currencies for upgrades and buying things and stamina and all that, wish it was a little simpler in that regard.",4
Amazing game!,5
Good,5
"10/10 amazing. Will play again, great gameplay. Recommend",5
Hella good game,5
Try it. It is such a breathe of fresh air from every other hero collector. And the devs actually listen and implement QoL improvements very quickly. You wont be disappinted. The only mild con js the chibi art style but the combat more than makes up for it as well as the awesome arts flr each hero,5
Very cool game,5
My friend told me about this game and it is very good.,5
Very fun game.,5
A special kind of Gacha,5
Doesn't even let me in the game. Lol,2
Awesome story great game,5
Takes up a lot of space but it's worth it,5
So far great game love the voice overs and story line. There's always new content. I would have given 5☆ but you can't sell off equipment you can only hold 100 and it fills quick. How can I get rid of the things I don't need? Just unbinding them will only work so long. Please fix or tell me how. Only other thing is takes so long to upgrade castle because of raising over all level first. But that is minor issues really. Besides that nice flow of gems to buy things. Love the special events so far. Keep up the good work.,4
Great Rpg. Graphics are epic!,5
This game sucksssss,1
Terrific graphics and upbeat music. Intriguing storyline.,5
Another great game from Nintendo.,5
"Incredibly well polished RPG Gacha. It excels in giving the player a multitude of things to do making it an engrossing experience if albeit a bit grindy. You'll find yourself forgiving the game for its shortcomings as you lose yourself in it. In short, it is definitely among the most polished mobile games to date. Kudos to Nintendo for publishing another mobile gem.",4
good game ! lost one star for conextion pb :(),3
Fun combat and nice looking. Dont bother if you dont plan on dropping some cash.,5
Good game if willing to put effort in,5
Nice,5
It is fun because you can fight as a human then shapeshift into a dragon to protect yourself and the empire you trying to save it is a cool game.,5
Wowza,5
Pretty fun get rid of the energy systems though!,5
Its fun really fun,4
"Crazy good game. Classic Nintendo to put out quality, not quantity.",5
Quality of production the like of which we rarely see on mobile.,4
My game crashes every time I open it.,1
Great five stars,5
Love the music and graphics!,5
"So far, so good!",4
Great game. Would 5 star but asked for rating to soon.,4
It's an ok time user. The daily rewards are good,4
I like it.,5
"Filled with character, cooperative fun, and free to play friendly. :)",5
It's a great game,5
Great graphics! Though wish this game didnt take up so much space.,5
"I like it, the story is good, gameplay is smooth and the anime transitions between cutscene is pretty good",5
"On my home network, my connection was ""too weak"" to run the game. I don't know how it played, I couldn't play it.",2
Dragon Adventure,4
It's probably my favorite mobile game since kingdom hearts union x,5
A very grindy Gacha game with an unfinished story.,2
It kept restarting to the beginning and saying it needed to download new content each time,1
Fun,5
"Game just exits if you have a slight connection issue it just kicks out of a raid, no opportunity to reconnect",3
"Fun game, but I kinda wish I had a joystick or dpad to maneuver around",4
"it's enjoyable, to a extent. repetition will get you to stop unless you love it.",4
Its a fun game so far,5
This game is super easy to learn and play and it also has great graphics.,5
Great game really entertaining,5
"Still early, but seems fun with out money. We'll see Nintendo... we'll see.",4
I didn't download the app,5
"One of the best gacha games on market. f2p friendly; turning the typical, exploitive nature of gacha games around for the better. Other gacha developers should take note of Cygames' approach to the players and community. Awesome game and well deserved 5 star review. Will be playing this game for the foreseeable future.",5
"The game itself is fine. The controls when moving around while not to big of a problem is a bit of a pain at first. Fights are nice and action packed and feel good for the control set up double swipe to roll tap to attack. The game is nice and fun for a casual game and it does take some grinding at some points. The art design is nice and the story is cute and simple evil forces, fight the bad guys, happy ending. My nephew is five and enjoys the game and understands that he can't buy stuff and will fight the same level to level up guys and doesn't bother him because it's fun. In short good game I like it, he loves it, dragons are cool.",5
I hate the fact that you have to download everything every time,4
Really good game and easy to use controls and game mechanics,5
I think the game is great,5
It would be better to have a four way arrow move system. Just a controller. Other than that I like the game.,5
Its the cooles most greatest game i ever played in my life i love fragons so so much,5
"I like the game, but the controls could be alot better.",4
"Great game, and definitely one of the best mobile games. Amazing job Nintendo and Cygames!",5
Wish i had a newer phone to really enjoy this game at its fullest,5
It is fun game,5
Great Gatcha game. Great music and great art. I recommend if you enjoy anime and games like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.,5
So far I enjoy this game,5
It's Nice l 🍎,5
"They have you link your game to your Nintendo account to safeguard your data. Cool. So when I had to reset my phone to factory settings and reinstall the game, I wasn't worried. Except... When I tried to relink the fresh install to my Nintendo account to restore data... It gives an error saying that account is already linked. No @$*!. There is literally no other way to restore the data I can find, and Nintendo's ""customer support"" sent a very unhelpful form message.",1
"You know every other gacha game has the regular currency you get in game and the BS currency you pay for? The ""regular"" currency has the same drop rate as every other game's premium currency. Also do you want characters? Too bad even if you get a ""guaranteed 5*"" it has a high chance of being an item or card instead (high chance as in about 3-1 items to characters)",1
"It's pretty decent but not what I was expecting, still a great game if you have some free time.",4
Good,5
This is AMAZING a must play,5
The game and soundtrack so far are just down right amazing. I'm really hooked and look forward to playing more of the story,5
"The game has been fun so far, it has great graphic, the characters have English voice actors, and so far the story is pretty interesting, combat system is a basic tap repeatively but the flashy combo effects make it fun.",4
I tried and liked it good job,5
Great game loving it so far,5
"It's actually more fun than I originally thought, I'm enjoying it very much!!",5
"Game has potential, but the controls aren't that good/great and the game is too slow pace in my opinion",3
Amazing,5
The music is hot keep up the good work!,5
Having a great time,5
Fun game,4
This game is way too much story and not enough game play,1
It was awsome took up to much space on my phone but still loved it,5
Best game graphics and story.,5
"This games brilliant love the story and characters, excellent graphics, controls are good they just take a little too get used to as far as attacking while moving goes... Other than that this games great.",5
"Amazing art, really good story and very nice game mechanics. I definitely recommend this to any rpg fans.",5
"Fun game, love the cute characters.",5
Probably the best mobile game ive ever played and im very critical and typically hate most of them.,5
"Be warned, this game is massive, data wise, close to a full gb of space. For a lot of people this will just be too big an app to invest in.",4
"Loved it more than I thought I did. Love the art, and story. It's quite refreshing.",5
"I'm impressed with how well this is put together, and that's coming from someone who has never shown mobile games the time of day.",4
Really fun so far,4
This is an action rpg game where you have city building elements added to it. If you like dragon and fighting and town building this might be for you. Great music and the presentation is very well done in my opinion.,5
"So far, the controls are intuitive and the writing - though basic - is enjoyable. I can see it becoming a grindfest, but until that wall is hit, I am having fun.",5
Amazing Nintendo with minimal micro transactions,5
"Good gameplay and stuff, will check back and update after more time",4
This game is so fun that I cried because of the story! No spoilers though. You'll need to find out yourself on this amazing game!,5
"Amazing graphics, weird controls, and an extra 2gb they don't tell you needs to be downloaded to play the game. Not worth it.",2
Type,4
Different from other games ive played and the pity system makes pulls seem decent.,4
Music is catchy,5
"This game has an unnecessarily low score on here. Having Nintendos name on this game brings harsher criticism. But compared to most gacha games on the play store, Dragalia Lost is superior. It rivals titles like Fire Emblem Heroes and Fates Grand Order.",5
"Really nice artwork and audio but overall the concept and play style are on the typical side , I had play a few of the exactly same play style ,so it's a bit on the bored side for me. Nice music thou",3
big download to start and another download for each area come on kill the experience right there and uninstall .,1
Is fine but is even bad,3
Loved it,5
Great game great graphics easy controls,5
EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME ITS SO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNN😍😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂😂,5
It's a great story in a fantastic world. The designes are awesome and the voice acting is great,5
Rhey,1
Exceptional gameplay,5
"Fun Dragon, Powers",5
It is great.,5
I love RPG'S they have that great storyline like this game good job,5
Its good,5
You should tell people that it takes up almost 3 gigs in game not a few mbs,2
"Feels like an old school Tales game, but portable!",5
Cool,5
"Well made game. However, its *3 part gacha literally killed it* who thought it was a good idea to summon for 3 different things, a part from having abysmal rates? Sure the 10 fold helps out, but it's literally just a huge tease when all you pull are 3*. And sure, 3* are viable but what about the inevitable powercreep? And don't even get me started with the God awful grinding, just because Grandblue Fantasy did it doesn't mean it should be a staple on other games. Having a relatively busy life severely hampers this game's value, unlike other gachas.",1
good,5
I think about no one being here,5
"This was a cool concept , I liked it but it was not excecuted well. Still gotta give em kudos",4
Really fun so far just the pauses to download the next mission are kinda annoying,5
The takes too slow,1
What is up with tese God dam questions,4
Love the voice acting and graphics controls are a small learning curve but other then that a GREAT game!,5
Simple but with a lot of depth,5
Awful rates,1
This is the most amazing phone rpg I've ever played!,5
It's a very good game and Nintendo has a reputation to protect and let's be honest Nintendo most times makes great games,5
I could not get it to start,1
Really good takes up a lot of space but it's worth it,5
Awesome controls beautiful graphics. And seemingly not pay to win. :),5
Story confusing and the characters are not lovable and your thrown into the story so you don't get any true motive or answer for what's going on,2
Most def to have on the go n spare times😎😎,5
"What I expect from a Nintendo made game. I love the story and characters, and the gameplay itself is pretty good~",5
Fun with good voice acting.,5
Game is amazing,5
Visually excellent fun to play,5
Game is advance for new players,5
This game is good enjoying my time with it,5
All the dragons are so cool!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😃😃😃😃😃😃😅😅😅😅😅😁😁😁😁😁😁,5
"Very clean, well made game. Got some lucky items that is making the game fun, can see why so many people are picking this up",5
Very flex,5
4000 dollars to roll a desired 5 star. 2gb data to reroll. Disgusting. Pretty though. Real shame.,1
I like it,4
"Looks great, controls are really weird though and a lot if it is pretty standard gacha fare. Its Nintendo though, so the polish is there, and gameplay besides the controls is engaging. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try - after all, it's free!",4
"This is basically a copy of Rune Story, but with worse controls. Attacking has a lot of end lag, and you can't even roll out of it. Also, it'd be nice to have different gachas for different things, so we're not forced to get things we don't need",4
Fun game with a decent battle system. Good voice acting and good story. Excellent character design.,4
Great game,5
It's so cool,5
"Good game but the dungeons are too short, no challenge in them",4
Very nice story so far,5
The game is really pretty and is really fun to play. I'd recommend it.,5
Fun game,5
Gameplay feels smooth and the music is nice,5
To big of an update,3
Amazing,5
"Stamina, gacha based unit AND equipment system, also expensive cash shop only banners for holidays? This is as phone gamey as it gets",1
Really 😎,5
love it,5
I think its good but I don't like the fact that it kicks me out after a amount of time,5
This game is hella fun,5
Having a blast trying out the game tonight,5
So far so good,5
It's so amazing I mean eallut amazing,5
"I've played plenty of phone games and this has got to be one of my favorites. We get a fun game with solid gameplay mechanics, a slowly unfolding rpg scenario full of lovable characters, a seemingly steady update of new events, and a partnership between Nintendo and Cygames. With how they've handled the game so far, I feel like they actually care about making the players happy, owning up to issues that the community finds as well as generously compensating us more than most other gacha games I play. Maybe the game isn't perfect yet but I have a feeling the devs want it to be, and I'm down to support them while they get it there.",5
It good,5
I'd like to see the fluidity of this game improved. It's well designed being a Nintendo game so I feel that it should be just a bit more of a higher tier of game and thus the gameplay should reflect. I'm new to this franchise so I don't really know to much but I like this game so far.,4
Very good story,5
"This game is a blend of dark cloud 2, chrono cross, final fantasy 9 and a few others. You'd think I'd rate it high but... It was too dumbed down. Too easy to win. As if this game was tailored for small children instead of real gamers. A game that's too easy like this gets boring fast. No matter how beautiful a game, without challenge, a victory over an opponent, doesn't feel like anything big.",1
Great so far mid ch.1,4
"I love this game. The music is so catchy and keeps me sitting at the main menu just to listen to it. The characters all have great personalities so far. But I would have preferred a premium price over microtansactions so much more. The gacha feel is still there and it just ruins the experience ever so slightly. I would still recommend this game, however.",4
Finally getting around to play this game. At first I wasnt expecting much. Because it's a mobile game. But I'm really impressed with it. It's a great game. Love the Dragons and Characters. Also being a Nintendo game makes it even cooler. I cant wait to see what comes out of this series. Maybe even see some of the characters show up in Super Smash Ultimate.,5
It's awesome and easy to control,5
Pretty good,5
Love it,5
"Cute graphics and the music is abosulte adorable and super catchy. Enjoying it so far, hopefully doesnt become a ""pay to win"" mmo",5
Great game fun to play,5
Fair gacha for f2p devs generous with free summons and even low star units useful,5
太肝,3
The AI is REALLY stupid; I can never turn on auto-play b/c my team will just keep walking into spike pits & geysers until they die. Barely rewards you for coming back for more.,4
Nice,5
This game is the best game i played so far on my phone,5
This is very different from other rpg games... It's interesting and fun. I am completely enthralled by every element of this Nintendo game!,5
Too many downloads.,1
It's good,4
Pretty damn entertaining!,5
The game is so good and I hope y'all make more!,5
Love it,5
Great gameplay and easy controls,5
Haha the character on the logo looks like meliodas from the seven deadly sins,5
Fine,5
Everything about this game is great except for the fact I have to download additional files after every quest.,3
Yeet,5
"installed game, ""please download 500MB more data"", 10 minutes later, played first level. Took about 3 minutes. ""please download 1.06GB more data"". Why do i have to download each level as i play, and why are they so huge. uninstalled game",1
"Great music, amazing story, nice voice acting, and great gameplay",5
Awesome graphics and action.,5
Very fun and easy,4
Game with cool charcters and a cool story it's super fun too!,5
I dont want to download every time I do something. Literally. Thats stupid.,1
This is an amazing game that everyone should at least try it has a grinding aspect and has no content that is trapped behind payment and is completely free it also has a great campaign that helps develop the characters,5
"Pretty fun, story is kinda cool too.",4
It's fun,5
Love it! Intensive hours of gameplay have helped me conclude this game is the mobile game of the year!,5
Stunning graphics and smooth animations so far enjoying the game experience,5

"I love everything about this game! The only thing I don't like is the fact that everything you try and do, SURPRISE! You need to download something, this became more and more annoying for me and I had to delete this game because it took up so much space on my phone.",4
At first i did not like the game but over time it just got more interesting,5
Recommended by a friend. It's a nice game. It's a little rough saving for tenfold pulls though. It would be nice if it was a little easier to unlock more units.,4
A fantastic and fun game with a nice story. The micro transactions are small and unobtrusive.,5
"Summoning hoping you get 5 star character, Ha!! Best of luck just to see your hope for a great character just to cry in despair cuz you only got a 5* wyrmprint and 300 duplicated characters..is no bueno. Blah",2
Love the dragons 😁😁😁😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 and I think there is a gacha feature 🎲🎲🎲🎲🎲🎲🎲good luck,5
Love it excellent game :),5
Idk it takes so long to load and takes all my space please fix the loading part,3
I'm uninstall in this game way too big for my phone need the extra gig for my phone I'm sticking to PC and console gaming if I were you. Playing MS2 Instead.,1
Fun,5
Great game,5
This game is so much fun. I've never played a game like this before. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised that every game that I played that was made by nintendo was fun.,5
Good,5
"So far this is a pretty good game, no complaints here",4
"This game is a blast. It's addictive, cute and has an amazing soundtrack. It's sad I almost missed it due to its rating. Yes, it's a Gacha game, so I can understand why someone looking at a Nintendo game could feel cheated. Gacha games aren't for everyone. But as a long time fan of the genre, I can say this is one of the most polished, complete gacha game out there. Also, it's a fresh of breath air to find a Gacha game where you can clear content without super rare drops. Sure you may he sad to not pull your favorite 5 star, but it's a great feeling to be able to progress without them.",5
"Waste of time, game play is ok until ch5. Very difficult to get 5 star. Game use up a lot of data and power. Maybe ok to play for a few day but lose interest very fast 👎👎👎",1
Very nice looking game,5
This the best game,5
"I loved it until a recent update produced an error preventing me from opening the app. After reinstalling it and re-linking my Nintendo account, it failed to retrieve my save data and had me start over. I had such good rolls and most of the Halloween items, so I'm discouraged at being forced to start over.",2
It's amazing for a phone rpg. The best by far. Great story gameplay and graphics,5
This is really well done game!,5
Awesome graphics,4
Amazing game,5
The 5star is suck,3
Awesome game,5
"early on, good actual rpg for a mobile. still some things to see, some relationship to internet and friend usage. hope it stays this good throughout.",5
Love this game fun as ever,5
"The gameplay is amazing and it has a very well developed story. The initial download takes pretty long but the following downloads are essentially two seconds. It has well established the standard of RPGs in this style and very much looks and feels like nintendo quality, even with the normal ""restrictions"" of the quality of mobile games. Whoever made this, ya did good.",5
Amazing game. Great pass time with decent level system totally recommend!!,5
Its amazing,5
Nice,5
Love this,5
The main complaint in 99% of the negative reviews is the ridiculous gacha system. The latest update added a garunteed 5 star charcter for $30...If you want to play a game where it cost $30 in the hopes of getting one good usable non duplicate high tier character who is only good against a specific counter then this game is for you. Everyone else should stay far away.,1
"Been playing since launch, the devs have been great with updates to content and mechanics, with a significant fix to dailies to help F2P players like me. Yeah getting 5* characters are low odds of obtaining, but you honestly don't need them for most of the game and there's ways to upgrade your lower rank characters into them. Its still a F2P phone game, but its easily the most skill based and forgiving phone game I've played in a long time.",5
The music is entrancing. That's all I can say about the game. Good soundtrack. That's it.,3
This game is dope. Enjoying every minute of it. Nintendo does it properly as usual.,5
I love it just need to improve the controls that all,5
"Kinda awkward controls, and not much content for a gacha game. The grind is truly absurd, later on.",4
All around great game,4
Cool concept needed better gameplay,5
I love it so far very smooth like I'm watching and anime,5
Good,5
I just hate that I have to download much,5
Awesome game but horrible controls,5
Fun characters and intuitive controls,5
This game kicks as@ totally love it,5
Awesome!!,5
"The game is a lot of fun, but the music is just boppin. My one issue is the start is slow",5
It is really fun and reminds me of anime,5
Nice,5
Excellent,5
Great chill game. Green friendly 4 surezies.,5
Amazing game play. So far everything about this game is great. The story really draws you in,5
"The graphics are definitely nice, and the music adds a very charming touch. Long tutorial, but very thorough.",5
I think is cool but its surprise ing that it was made by Nintendo,5
addictive,5
This game is so good. It's like mobile phantasy star,5
I love the story plot and the amount of characters there are that adds a very healthy amount of diversity,4
Hard to get at first but a lot of fun afterwards.,5
I think this is VERY COOL,5
Garbage,1
Amazing,5
Game don't work,1
Havent played enough to see the content available,3
Awesome game love it,5
Dont get why it has to download each chapter but it does a good job passing time,4
Awesome!,5
this is awesome,5
Adventurous,5
"The game as a lot of potential but is currently held back by the overly punishing waits and grinds to be able to do content in the game, and unfair event boss designs and a pretty greedy gacha system. Because otherwise it has great game play and good audiovisual and decent storytelling.",3
Bored,1
It can get hard latter on,4
I awesome,5
Just a big grind,2
Hated it.,1
"Really enjoyed it in the beginning. Catchy music. Enjoyed the multiplayer aspect, however started to become a little too grindy, and as with most games of the genre, a little too beholden to the gacha. Having raids where someone was consistently under powered became a bummer. Can't deal with games anymore where you feel like you have to spend 24/7 playing to feel like you're keeping up...",3
JUST A G0SH DARN BLESSIN,5
"Best game on mobile, but don't forget to try FEH. Cygames are the best game company ever in the world because I like the fact they listen to the player base making the game a better place for us nerds and they are awesome",5
"Rather fun, good story with a fair currency so it not a pay to win like others . Which is a good thing too.",5
Hell yeah busted a nut playing lost no nut November UwU nibba,5
Too many downloads and takes too long to download.,1
Super awesome! Easy to get into & great graphics.,5
it so badass,5
It's one of the best moble games i've ever played and the plot is great too,5
Good game. Controls are a little too touchy. Story lines are captivating and music is catchy.,5
Ok,5
Its pretty interesting never thought I enjoy another Nintendo game,5
It's a pretty fun and unique gacha game with some rpg elements mixed in.,5
"Good game. Nice graphics, and story.",5
"It's fun at first but getts really grindy, I think to push you to buy premium currency to buy items that get your characters, weapons, perk cards, and dragons to ther final tiers of power. Thats fine, and you can get everything from grinding for it and/or in events that the game has regularly, so if you like the game have fun. I just didn't like that aspect, the controls, and how your stats started to matter more than your ability to dodge and attack.",3
"Well,I can't download it,too much bytes,but it looks amazing,please make this game cheaper for bytes!",3
Awesome,4
Good story so far and good gameplay.,4
I love dragons and the game,5
Another banger from nintendo! Everything is perfect except the scenes do get a bit choppy from here and there.But overall this is one of my favorite mobile games so far!,5
Not usually my sort of game but I'm actually enjoying it,4
"You have to pay big time, I understand is business, but kind of too greedy. Don't think it will last that long",2
BS rates and cash grab. Fun idea but poorly implemented. Hard pass for me,1
I was excited to play this game but the characters only showed up as shadows. At first I thought it was an art style because it was a night scene. It oddly worked for the scene but then I realised it was going to remain that way.,2
160错误,4
Awesome art and storyline is interesting. But I think the game control could be smoother,4
great,5
Awesome!,5
Creative game Band new way play rpg game,4
The biggest downside for this game is you have to download every level to play it along with having already downloaded the core content,3
Loved the game but to many downloads so I ran out of storage and couldn't play maybe make it have less downloads,3
I recommend it is a great game I've been playing for couple of hours great graphic good story fun to play,5
"Overall amazing game, really enjoying it so far",5
It is very addictive,5
The effects are amazing,5
"I was really excited for this IP and rushed through the available campaign as soon as possible. But most of fun ended after that. The gameplay is fun as a 3rd person hack and slash style game, but the controls could use some work, esp. in the rolling and force break mechanic. The companion AI is essentially useless for actually helping you, with no sense of self preservation nor significant damage output. The item collection is short lived fun. Collecting things is nice, but the grind to upgrade and make things useful, especially weapons, is more work than I want to put in. You're forced to swap between 2 menus several times to upgrade a single weapon, which is really inefficient. Also the overall experience between switching different menus is slow. The graphics are nice, but even with a OnePlus 5T, a fairly modern phone, it still feels clunky to move between the menus. Finally, the Gacha aspect is as bad as it gets. The gamble is to be expected, but it feels worse in this game. Overall, I'll be better off without this game. I'm glad I haven't spent any money on this game as the value, even as a free to play game, just isn't there for me.",2
Love it 🐉🐲😍👍,4
Tis fun,5
Blatant cash grab.,1
I haven't been able to play alot because it has to download a huge file just about every time I open the app and I really dont have the time to leave the app open while it updates. But from what I have gotten to play i can tell that it's a well developed game,3
"The OST is great, characters are great, but the battle controls are a bit wonky to me. Wish it had a on-screen directional pad.",5
Was doing the prequel story and was fine with the original update upon starting... but another 1gb update after the beginning was a bit much for me to invest in a game that I may not end up liking in the end...,3
i love Dragalia lost because its a game that has a unique game style and isnt a cliche gacha game. its one of the games inplayed that i have actually enjoyed spending hours on. Thanks Nintendo!,5
It's pretty snazy,5
I'm in ahh right now,5
Too preditory,1
Great,5
Fun,5
I love it even though im a big weeb,5
Good,5
Good so far,5
"This game would be an excellent introduction of Gacha games to a fan who hasn't played one before. The game is very fair in the content offered, even for purely free to play users.  However, in a recent update, the developers arbitrarily decided to restrict certain devices from playing that were previously allowed, resulting in many players being unable to continue playing, even after spending significant money on the game. For as fun as the game was, I think it's too risky to play when your access can be lost with a future update.",2
"Enjoyable game experience in itself. However, character progression is frankly a fairly punishing experience. Even if you gather enough material to promote a character, they need a significant amount of resources to be effective. Those resources are essentially behind a pay wall in that in order to obtain them you need to either buy them, have a stable of characters that are capable of exploiting elemental weaknesses (which you won't have unless you pay or grind hard) for raid and boss events, or just grind grind grind your phone battery to death. Honestly, the art is fantastic and the music is great. I like the gameplay itself, just wish it didn't punish you into paying. Tossing players some free stuff every once in a while would go a long way to getting some traction as well. Tldr: has potential, pay walled/abnormally grindy character progression.",2
To many downloads and slow progression.overall not worth the time.,3
Nah brah. Just not for me. It's not terrible but it's not good either.,2
I love it,5
Controlits kind of hard to control where you are going other than that the game is great 👌,5
This game is so much fun in the graphics are cool and the controls are fun to play,5
"To be fair it's excellent. Not excellent qualities include the over lapping amounts of download after downloads. That part kind of stinks, but other than that it's great.",5
Nice,5
"I love the ability to shapeshift into a dragon, its awesome.",5
The game games mechanics are kinda of average and the characters bland but the game does have a charm to it that you can't deny. So if you come into this game expecting revolutionary mechanics and story look elsewhere but if you've come to have a relaxing game you play on your free time then it's not the worst choice in the world,5
you can be a dragon enough said,5
This game is so fun to play and the controls are easy to learn.,5
I loved it!,5
SOOOOO UNOYING. Ahhhhhhhhh f################ck damn it mother f###ers🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕,2
Fun to play.,5
Great story and very addictive. Good Nintendo game.,4
The big download is well worth it,5
pretty cool game so far,4
Yes good stuff,5
I don't even know exactly where or how this series started but I love it!,5
"The music is bumping, graphics are amazing, and the characters are super cute! Besides getting used to these controls I say this is a very fun game.",5
Really enjoying it..... even rerolling 5 star units will elude you.,5
neat,5
its fun.,4
Standard nintendo faire. Not that thats a bad thing. Great quailty. Little pay to win with a GACHA system,5
Good so far let see where it goes.,4
Its neat,5
Love it,4
"Very Immersive, slightly p2p. Not overly excessive on p2p",5
Fun time waster...,5
"The game wont load. The second I open it, there is an authentication error",1
The game has potential but the rates for 5 stars are way too low considering you have to compete with two other categories besides units in the summon pool.,4
Awesome,5
Neat,5
"Wonderful voice acting from the Japanese cast, fun game play, easy controls, and great story and graphics.",5
fun game!!,5
Its a Interesting game I can see myself playing this game from time to time I like the Storyteller an intro for this game concussions are pretty nice I found an awesome that you can transform into a dragon controller for his game I'm not a fan of it I wish it was more like a commercial pad instead of tapping on the screen of direction that you want to go this game needs a controller setup am giving this game 3 stars its an ok game not bad but it can be much much better,3
Love it!,5
Gg,5
"Very good game, I love it but can u please find a way to make it work 2 handed for combat not just one",5
Its cute fun game to kill time,5
Great game. Unique experience and fun combat system.,5
Good,5
"This game is addicting, fun, and engaging. Besides the stamina this game is perfect!",5
This game is amazing it's very captivating and enjoyable,5
I like it,5
Excellent game good story,5
5 star because of DAOKO,5
"While this game has a fair share of issues to be ironed out, the devs are by far the best I've seen in any gacha. Almost all of my problems from launch have been addressed promptly and been handled great. Hope to see this continued support from these great devs.",5
It has great graphics and the controls play good.,5
An enjoyable game and story. Only complaint is downloading stuff every mission and that I have to play it with my phone vertical and not horizontal.,5
best game ever lol favorite now show it everywhere,5
Not so far,5
Grate swords but has wired stuff sometime,3
Love it,5
It could been better for lower tablet Androids,3
I love it,5
Amazing story and unique gameplay that requires skill. Just having the best units doesn't guarantee success.,5
Wonderfully addictive game. Love the gameplay and controls. Tends to lag a bit on higher graphics but other tgan that wonderful game.!,5
Super cute chibi rpg. Very high level of polish. Coming from FGO so nothing in the game is new to me except how much I enjoy it. Would prefer regular horizontal layout since fingers cramp up playing vertically. Wonder who thought that was a good idea...,5
This games great but please increase the pull rate for 5 star units or give more wyrmite pls,4
Love the music love the story love the gameplay a must have on your mobile no joke,5
It sucks,1
Needs WiFi but is fun and simple. Easy controls and beautiful graphics,5
It's bad,3
I couldn't even start,1
Why dafuq do I have to download each level one by one separately?,2
I like the RPG style and 3D models in this game! It's just an extraordinary game!,5
I love it,5
It Nintendo so I love it immediately,5
Nice,5
Love it❤!!!,5
I only played intro but it seemed really amazing wish I had more phone memory,5
Fun,5
The drop rates are rough on 5* characters and you're competing with a drop pool that includes useless 5* items.,1
their is a lot of downloading and it takes a long time but I love the concept of the game AND the graphics,5
"I'm one of the early players of the game after roughly 2 months, and I still greatly enjoy this game. Plenty to do and continuous events keep things interesting. There's always something to grind towards and the developers are always listening to player feedback and trying to make improvements for both old and new players. For a Gacha game, they have been generous on giving out good units and resources to help summon. The co-op nature of the game is a ton of fun too. Definitely recommend giving this game a try if you're on the fence. Story and Characters are all well written and the gameplay will have you hooked as well!",5
"Fun little dungeon crawler, if you get lucky with your gacha rolls it's an easy fun little game. Might be more challenging if you don't have strong heroes, but I got a 5 star, so I can confirm you steamroll your enemies in the beginning.",4
Epic style,5
Very cool game.,5
Graphics could use a touch up,5
"Most amazing game I've played in years,and the story mode is amazing!",5
It's an overall great game nothing is really wrong with it,5
So far so good,5
Best mobile JRPG on the market,5
Addictive,5
Good game the gacha hell is so real it hurts though,3
"The game is great! The graphics are awesome aside from the occasional view obstruction. If the controls were a little more aptly placed, that would help alot.",5
It's honestly really good. I was very iffy about it when I first downloaded it. Nintendo did a good job. No time based fighting. Love it,5
"A great story, good music, and addictive",5
Pretty cool,5
My favorite take on the mobile/collectibles/jrpg genre I've seen so far.,5
Decent,4
A fun rpg with a compelling story Only thing i'd say is slightly annoying is that it has to download every time you progress in the story,5
"So far this game is looking like it's gonna be my favorite mobile game. Controls are amazing, especially with a note 8. Its a shame the stylus doesnt work in the menus but thats easily forgiven and not a big deal.",5
It sucks that you have to download nearly every mission.,3
Keep it up,5
It's Ebic,5
Deff a good game like the rpg types of games so this one is a deff yes but the movement could be a lil better but all in all a grate game,5
Amazing game,5
Pretty good so far,5
It's like watching an anime and has some good voice actors. I enjoy a good cutscene here and there too. Enjoying it so far can't wait to progress more in the story. 😱,5
"My favorite mobile game so far. I can tell a lot of effort has been put into all aspects of this game. The developers even listen to player feedback and respond quickly, which is crazy for a gacha game. I can see myself playing this for a very long time!",5
"Rated 1 star because Nintendo sends me an email to receive cool looking wallpaper like 2-3 days ago, I go to get them, and they aren't available anymore :\",1
Make this into an anime. It would be dope af,4
I love it so much!,5
"Definitely loving it, easy to reroll and the nods to other cygames titles are great",5
Great game to play lots of upgrading,5
Great game will recommend,5
Awesome game,5
Free? Worth it. Graphics nice. Gameplay feels good.,5
Addictive,5
"Pretty Deece tbh, quick n fun and good time-filler, plus pretty.",4
Not what I was expecting at all. And thank God it wasn't. Greatlyb enjoying this game. Good story great graphics for a mobile game. Well done developers,5
"Super slow almost dead stop f2p only progress after a certain point, great art and okay gameplay shame its ruined by greed and terrible gacha rates",1
Dope game,5
"Great story and graphics, marvelous controls. It's all the package",5
"Great graphics and music For those who complain about downloading after chapters, you can bulk download in the options>system menu Coop tutorial currently freezes the game, so hopefully that can get fixed so I can progress",3
Lol,5
it's a really great game!,5
It's an adventure,5
great game.,5
"For a mobile action RPG it has pretty good production values, catchy music (you'll get one or two tracks stuck in your head) and the art style is gorgeous. Haven't played deep enough to get an impression of the gameplay mechanics yet.",4
"A fun game with a lot to offer, but it requires a lot to download and can be slow and a bit much for some devices.",3
I love it! Pretty awesome game.,5
Great time killer,5
"Very addicting core gameplay loop, Cool story and setting. Not too sure about needing to download every level. It gets a bit tedious so make sure you have a good Wi-Fi connection when playing but other than that I have no qualms with this game",5
Game is great. Just wish it had controller support.,5
"I wish there was the virtual joy stick to play, but other than that, everything is perfect! Thank you Nintendo!!!",5
Dargons I love Dargons,5
Very awesome game,5
absolutely the best phone game I've ever played I hated phone games until now and it's by my favorite gaming company Nintendo oh how I love Nintendo and how I love Dragalia lost 10's 10's 10's ACROSS THE BOARD!!!,5
SO COOL!,5
"I had to uninstall, the game itself is fun. Unfortunately Dragalia Lost keeps disconnecting and saying my authentication is wrong despite using the same device and wifi, it got so bad that it crashed my entire internet multiple times while trying to play it.",3
Great game,5
I love the stories this game tells and the plot is great,5
"Nintendo made it, cash cow but pretty good",5
"The fact that I have been playing since launch and got 0 five star adventures. I thought you had a system that helps me get them, but instead it resets after wrymprints. It's a game, let it be fun, you know we want adventures to play with so why make it impossible? Be a game that actually rewards you for playing. Otherwise people will stop playing like me.",1
Its just an all around good game i really like the controls but the story is really good,5
I love how you can transform into a dragon and how you can make them better,5
"Very fun, enjoyable world building and story, fun characters, animation canceling attacks/movement, skill gaps AND equipment collecting, fanservice, and finally, you can turn into dragons. ...pretty neat-o lol 9/10",5
I like the story,5
You guys did a good job. I can't stop playing it.,5
predatory gacha system beware,1
really disappointed with gacha,1
Really Fun To Play So Far I Will Continue To Play It! Story Line is Keeping Me Engrossed!,5
Needs work on cut-scenes. Besides that everything else is very enjoyable,4
Really fun and easy to pick up,5
"Good game, but too many bugs. Server connections are horrible and co-op is essentially broken. It is infuriating to try and play only to join a group and be kicked out for connectivity problems.",2
Overall all i love the visuals and music it really good rpg so far.,5
Quite well done,4
I love this game,5
It's a great game for me and. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😁😁😁🇨🇴🇱🇷🤩,5
Great story,4
This is a great progression game that you don't see a lot of on phones.,5
Ok,5
Really fun game and worth the large download. Fairly decent story.,5
I really like the game! It's just really large for a Phone game. I would REALLY like it on 3ds with maybe instead of the Friends menu Streetpass/Spotpass.,4
Good dragon and character matching. Graphics are are pretty cool,4
Very fun amd addicting,5
Edit: cash grab,1
Amazing game,5
I love it all has a wide character list and I just love it!!!😍,5
For some reason I can't update it and NO it's not data. I have room I just can't seem to download properly it's STUPID,2
Great game play and awesome rpg mechanics. Graphics are amazing and the cut scenes are beautiful.,5
Its a great game but could you get it to were there is more game less waiting for it to download,4
Only about an hour in and the game is smooth and fun. Gameplay is quick and easy to pick up. Graphics are really nice as well. Story is pretty good too. But the grind is where it gets really addictive. I can see myself getting sucked in for hours.,5
Lot better than I remember.,5
Epic7Seven is better like it has better graphics and this game graphics sucks it lools like a two year old draw a anime but worse so ya nintendo sucks and ps4 is better so suck it,1
"I've been unable to join a co-op game in days, literally dozens of attempts and everytime the room is already full. Matchmaking needs serious work.",3
"The best gotcha game, I have played since brave souls bleach. The graphics are crisp. the music is really enjoyable and normally I don't care for the music and anything, but this games music is really nice. Love the design of the menu as well but it clearly takes inspiration from Persona 5.",5
"Neat almost like an old fashioned rpg, graphics are cartoonish but done rather well, if I could find a way to download each mission before I unlock it that would be peachy because it's rather annoying to download addition content every single mission in a chapter, due to my location.",5
Doesn't work. Keeps saying to upgrade,1
If you love old school RPG with a hint of humor this is for you,5
To much downloading like you have to download every lvl,4
Really fun,5
Excellent,5
This Game Is Good Cant Wait To Go Further into The Adventures!!! Thanks For Making a Great Game!,5
Had to stp and restart downloads multiple times to get the game to work,3
Great game great graphic and great controls what else can one ask for,5
Game won't login. Keeps saying something about network errors. Can't give a good rating if the game won't even load.,1
Still needs a little work but I think it has the potential to be great,5
So far so good but I'll probably lose interest soon enough,3
Very cute graphics and fun gameplay.,5
"It's good, I could say. But the only problem is; with only two gigabytes on my phone left, it takes up too much space.",3
Great Gacha game with an incredible devs that are actively trying to make the game better,5
A great game one of the best phone games I've played,5
BEST GAME IN ALL TIME,5
Fun!,5
"Completely unique from all of the other mobile games out there!!!! Totally awesome! Love the gameplay more then the story, but even the story is amazingly well done.",5
"I love this game, great story, characters, music, AND THEIR MOUTHS MOVE WHEN THEY TALK!!!! Also love the cut scenes.",5
"Good gameplay and controls, love it",5
This game is amazing make more like it please,5
I have tried downloading this game to give a try and everytime i do it doesnt let me play by either a problem with download or no internet connection when i clearly have perfect wifi connection so until i play you guys get one star,1
Fun Fun Fun,5
"Its a great game to just waist some time with, the levels feel less linear then other ""action rpgs"" on mobile, the controls are simple and the graphics are great and the game runs amazingly, the voice acting is good and the story is actually kind of intriguing this game does not feel like a cash grab like other mobile games as the summoning currency comes in plenty and the game gives you great characters for just playing the story",5
Great game!,5
It is Nintendo so you already know it's good.,5
It crashes way to often,1
Very enjoyable with lots of quest and other objectives to keep you busy,5
It Nintendo so so u know it is good,5
It's fun,5
Pretty well made good graphics fun to play,5
Hands down my favorite mobile game!,5
Is this a pay to win game?,3
Its fun,5
Polished and fun.,5
Cool game,5
A ton of fun! I love this game,5
"I freaking love this game, I have been on the hunt for a not extremely confusing rpg that has easy controls and I've finally found it! I love how it works and it is easy to understand!",5
"Im enjoying atm, recommend everyone try it out",5
Its entertainment for now need to play more then I'll change my review,4
Sick game play unique controls and items,5
Funny voice acting,4
"Great game, needs a big storage.",5
"Very fun an addictive RPG. Deep gameplay, engaging story, and character development.",5
This is addicting,5
So far this game has been easy to get the hang of with a rather enjoyable story to boot. I will continue to to play to see what happens to our young hero.,5
"This is definitely the best game I've ever played on mobile. Graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun and the story is incredible!",5
Definitely one of the better games on mobile right now. Really loving it right now.,5
Amazing all around game,5
It got a good story line,5
Would love to see it on Switch,5
"Good game and great music. Story is good as well. Only complaint is the summoning rate for actual 5 star characters. Yes I got lucky and got 2 5 stars but when I looked at the % rate to get them, I was amazed I even got a single 5 star. Th % rate for a 5 star character is ridiculously low compared to all the gacha games I've played so far.",4
It's an awesome game don't play many on my phone but this is a great app,5
A good games I think,5
This game is amazing. I absolutely love it.,5
I love how unique the summoning animations are keeps it fun. And sound track is songs I heard before good touch,5
Overall enjoyable with little commitment necessary and steady progression,5
LOVE IT! The only thing I would change is putting an actual virtual joystick in place for movement instead of the current movement.,5
"Wonderful presentation, decent story and gameplay.",4
"Great game. Gatcha mechanics seem fair, game's a lot of fun with others, and the music is amazing. Nintendo done good.",5
Its fun,5
Very fun! 10/10,5
Sick,5
Needs more summons but great game,4
Impressive,5
Its fun!,5
Fun and addictive,5
It's a lot of fun! Enjoying the gameplay 1 hour into it!,5
"I like the game but, why all the downloads? It would be nice to have more fight control.",4
"Pretty fun RPG. I wish it was a little more challenging, but I like that you can upgrade your characters and such.",4
Ots fun,5
"Really fun so far, the quality is really up there for a moblie game. Plus really enjoying the story, all the lore and the wonderful soundtrack/ voice work.",5
"A fun rpg title, just dont support the microtransactions.",5
Nintendo Magic,5
I'm having a great time with this game so far.,5
I Love this game!! It has dragons and beautiful manga characters plus great art!!,5
Awesome animation,5
Much better gameplay than I expected from a mobile gacha game. Skill level makes up for unit pulls and the devs are constantly communicating with the community to fix their issues,5
"Pretty good, nice action, can dash to avoid attacks, use a burst damage skill, use supportive abilities, etc. Cute graphics.",4
it's a game alright,3
Good game so far. Willing to invest a few more hours in it.,5
"I can't give this a 5 because the data devoured my phone :( I just don't have gigabits of space even after removing a lot of apps from my phone. I played though the first part and I love it, but I just don't have that kind of space on my phone.",4
"Holy cow, a game where all the music is stuff from famous Jpop star DAOKO? It's so surreal playing a game where all the music is stuff you've listened to countless times already. Oh the game is pretty fun too, play on wi-gi.",4
"After a couple weeks, it get super boring",2
It won't let me play the game,5
Meow,5
I like it,5
This is a hack & slash game with rpg elements and has a good storyline,4
As great as Fire Emblem Heroes if not better! Has the best story and voice acting I ever heard!,4
Great game,5
I loved it,5
Fun,5
The all beast looks like from naruto,1
I really like the graphics and voice acting.,5
It a. Good game,5
Really fun game. Nintendo does it again.,5
Dope little RPG,5
GOOD,5
Nintendo's first original mobile game is better than I expected. Good story and easy controls makes this hard to put down.,5
Yep! This game is awesome.,3
A lot of downloads for every level but as long as your on wifi it not to horrible of wait for the download,5
I found a bug that the golem went off track when he rolled,5
Omg the music its awsome good job,5
it is good but you need to download something else,1
This is awesome,5
Cooooooooool,5
Good game,5
I just downloaded this game and I can't even get on. It tells me that connection failed. Everything else that uses a connection works!,2
Amazing! Having a lot to do makes my day. The graphics are great too!,5
"Character movement has been glitched since release. No attempt to fix it has been made to date. Character tries to fight the controls and do his/her own thing while I try like hell to get it to do something specific like stop swinging and go grab a barrel or dragon statue, etc.",4
The characters were all black.,4
"I think this is a really fun game with some minor glitches nothing major, it would be nice if it had a better communication options in coop,and ways to trade with players. But other than that a really fun game and you should pick it up!",5
"Fun, and beautiful",4
This is a great game,5
10000000000000%good!,5
This game is just awesome!,5
Many ways to get stronger for free.,5
"Fairly solid fun, more than I expected from a mobile game, I hope microtransactions do not ruin it since I am just at the beginning",5
"The controls can be a little wonky at times, but great graphics and really fun to play. I like the mission set up and the balance of free and store.",5
"I could go on about the really expensive iap's, the paywall you are going to slam into, or the lowest drop rates outside of Vegas (less than .5%). I could also tell you that the game does look and play pretty damn well, but the truth is none of that matters because the game isn't really that fun. For a game that needs to be always online there is no guild, no PvP, no chat, only basic co-op. There are your typical grind event quests, a story mode with static cutscenes and a LOT of upgrade micromanagement. After you beat story mode on normal (which only takes a day or two) there is literally nothing else to do but start over again on hard. That's not fun, that's punishment.",1
I love the game and can't wait for more chapters of the story to be released!,5
Ehh,3
"While this is a gacha game, I'm having lots of fun by playing F2P. The core gameplay is very fun and each character has their unique story. Not to mention the songs !",5
It's kinda laggy and takes too long to load but abousoluty beutiful garaphics for a mobile game,5
I liek it,4
Good game.,5
Dope,5
I love it soooooooooooo much,5
I love this game. I've played it for hours at a time and never get bored of it. ☺,5
Saga,5
"Nice game, good for mobile devices",5
This game is really fun!,5
"Absolutely love the game. Its very fun, the ost is great, the characters are very lovable, and I could just play it for hours. The only complain that I have is that you have to download MB each time you do a mission or play a story event. Its not much but it does add up eventually.",5
"Really enjoyed the first hour of play. Controls are smooth, story line is interesting thus far and graphics are tops. My only concern is there being a need for storage on every chapter. My phone doesn't have memory big enough to continue playing.",3
Great game,5
It is fun and entertaining and characters are bite sized whats not to like,5
It's on Pont,5
Addicted,5
Sawadikap mot moi,5
"Alright, so the game is overall beautiful. Great graphics and storyline, but I had to quit early because of how much storage it took up, making me download lots of stuff, making me not being able to continue because of all the storage it took.",4
Fun I guess,5
Very grindy and eventful.game love it,5
The story and gameplay is amazing and keeps me playing,5
Awesome game very addicting,5
Best up to date nintendo game,5
It's actually kinda fun,5
It is the best game ever,5
Great voice acting!!,5
It's so good,5
Dope!,5
"Beautiful game, great music",5
"Great game!! Super fun with unique movement mechanics!! Ofc there are things that need to be worked on, but still worth trying!!",5
Well made,5
very nice...i liked it.,5
THE Game is awesome you need to make more games like the GAME! .😎😃😗😁😏,5
I love this game very much for Its story and its unique characters.,5
"The game us fun and I do enjoy the story line. Using a finger to control everything is a little hard but it's a phone game, so really shouldn't expect anything else lol",5
I love this game so far it's very interesting,5
Nice graphics and fun game,5
Best game I ever played,5
"Really love the game.It's just as fun as I thought it'd be if not more. Glad the co-op is fix too now I can process threw raids and story. Now their just a minor bug where vocal turn on when I have it set off when I restart the game. This issue occurred after reinstalling the game. Also (might be asking a lot for a mobile game but..) It would be awesome if the english dub was 100% voice seeing as Japanese is. Other than those though, I'm satisfied.",5
Great game. Super in depth. Lots of fun music and sounds.,5
This is the best game,5
Awesome game and characters,5
It is a great game with an interesting storyline. The mechanics are smooth and satisfying as well.,5
It's really fun and I enjoy the character art and choices.,5
Pleased,5
Its amazing i can quit GBF coz this,5
The game keeps telling me that I need to update the app even though I have the latest version and even trying to update it manually does nothing. It's a pretty major bug if I can't even play your game because of an infinite loop. Even uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work,1
Make this console game series!☺,5
"The ""wall of pay to win"" isn't nearly as present as many think. Due to the many things that can be upgraded and how easy it is to get those items, anyone can freely play forever. The stories each character and dragon have give them so much personality and are so fun. This a fantastic game.",5
More more,5
Cool,4
"I really like this game but there are some small issues that can be fixed pretty easily. The controls are pretty intuitive but sometimes around the edges of the display it won't pick up your inputs. Also sometimes when selecting a facility at the castle it immediately cycles out of the menu making you have to select it multiple times. An added feature that would be nice is to include in the co-op selection information about other players already attempting to start a co-op game. This game is fantastic though, the weapon leveling system is delightful and the story/characters are pretty good too.",4
Says to update when I just downloaded the game. Can't even open it to try it out,1
fun game good storyline but the controls are horrible,4
It's a playable anime,5
Needs more audio voice for telling stories,3
Cute Awesome Nintendo Game by Cygames & Criware.,5
It's a good game.,3
Constant mandatory updates and downloads.,2
Better then I expected.,5
Good game,5
Enjoying it now that I can play it.,5
Great game,5
"Fun combat, good battle system. Since you aren't playing against humans, real money purchases only speed up the game, not necessarily put you at a competitive advantage. Devs are very vocal about upcoming changes and are very generous with thank you items.",5
App not loadding,2
This clearly isn't for Android users since it won't load the in game character models during the tutorial at all.,1
"220 pulls, not a single 5* hero.",1
"Do you like waiting around and loading screens? Then this is the game for you! It is great when you actually get to play it, that just isn't often enough.",3
Best game I ever played,5
Dragons n cute girls,4
I love fantasy so this fits right in for me.,5
Goood,5
Lots of fun but the movement takes getting use to.,5
Wouldn't expect anything less from Nintendo!😃,5
Super rad game,5
It's amazing!,5
"Very cool, dragons are always a win",5
"Awesome graphics and control, well worth the time",5
Awesome,5
I love this game so much .,5
Good,4
This is honestly one of the best RPG games I have played,5
"The latest arc as of 11/15/2018, A Wish to the Winds, had a nice and relatable story about a sister caring for her younger brother. The developers put a lot of thought into character development, which we see with every arc.",5
"The controls can be a little difficult to get used to, but the game is engaging",5
I like it a lot,4
This is fun,4
A surprising amount of meat on its bones for a mobile game. Pretty good overall.,4
Good game,5
Love it,5
a lot of focus on story and a fun gameplay style. gacha rates suck but game is fun to play and you don't need special characters.,5
The game itself is very enjoyable but the gacha is the only thing that can tick someone off... I need Eldwater to rank up troops but when a 10 fold summon gives 10 Cards with no doubles you just wasted a free ticket or bunch of gems,3
I love Niddhog!,5
I really like the gameplay and story of the game it self,5
Meh,3
So far it's an incredibly fun game Update on 11/15/2018: yup still alot of fun,5
"Great story, fun characters, good gameplay. Coop experience makes this game stand out above the rest. This game would be 5 star rating if not for the following: 1. After two weeks I'm still not able to purchase anything from the store due to a bug. 2. Controls can be inconsistent with certain combos (force strikes in particular). Aiming is sometimes completely unintuitive and sometimes wont even activate.",5
"I really love this game! But one small thing that annoys me is when the army veteran said a swear word. This is a Nintendo game. It just, bugs me. And also, this is too similar to Dragon Ball Legends. Summons. Consecutive Summons. Dragalia. DRAGON. LOST. LEGENDS. Can you catch my drift?",5
I LOVE ANIME,5
The characters are so adorable ;p,5
"It was fun. A lot of work was put into it, the different fighting styles are all mostly fun to use, and I really like characters and their designs.",5
It's good,5
Love it,5
Fun time waster.,4
"my game is stuck on the tutorial and won't progress the story. (the tutorial regarding events.) EDIT: tutorial finally progressed after I googled it, and reading that you need to turn off wifi and power saver....",5
Games pretty lit I deff recommend it,5
Good,4
"Pretty terrible, downloaded just now and game says it requires an update and to please go to the app store. I click update to go to the app store and there is no update. Only open or uninstall. No troubleshooting is working.",1
"Very addictive, love it!",5
Nov 15 just dl and won't update. Caught is update loop. Fail.,1
Game is great. Rates are a bit rough but they are generous.,5
"For some reason it only worked bc I turned off my wifi and used data, otherwise it's a fun game/story.",1
"The game told me there was an update when there wasn't, and didn't allow me to enter.",1
It's a very good nintendo game!,5
"Fun for a little while, but it quickly gets repetitive. It's very focused on the story. The gameplay is a bit grindy, which I often like. Not so much this time. If you like doing the same thing over and over and over, give it a go.",3
IT'S AWESOME! It has amazing graphics and an interesting plotline. It also lets you link your nintendo account so you can get bonus rewards!,5
It's amazing,5
So cool,5
Great game,5
Fun game,5
"Great graphics, cool original story and pretty simple game mechanics. Fun game.",4
Very anime,5
"For a free app this is great. Super polished. Obviously it follows p2w m models, but still fun for a mobile game.",5
"The controls are a bit buggy, but other than that amazing.",5
Good game. But ridiculous amount of downloads.,4
Good game,5
"The load times are terrible and completely ruin the game. I have gigabit at home, so I know it's a problem on their end.",1
Love it,5
I love it,5
"Installed the app, linked to mi Nintendo account, but it keeps askimg me to update to the latest version and sends me to the Play Store but THERE IS NO UPDATE!!!",1
Loved it,5
Amazing slow download though.,5
Amazing game. Good job Cygames.,5
"Love the game, just two things I want to see ; allow for multiple devices (in able to play on my tablet, then shut that down and switch to my phone) and gamepad support would be great.",4
Its just....I love it,5
"Be honest, the drop rate is crazy low.",3
Very well polished game. The most important thing is how much attention the developers are giving to player feedback. Updates are impressively assertive. Keep doing the amazing job!!!,5
"I love how the game plays and the great story... my only 2 complaints are that getting into a co-op mode crashes alot of the time, and the character movement is very janky cause you have to stop walking to change directions. i wish it had a joystick i could use to direct my character.",4
"Fun, an actual game not just automatic, and good production values.",5
Very cute character designs!,5
If your an anemie lover like me its for you,5
"I love this game, it's so good and has a great story behind it.",5
Is a very good gacha game.,5
Love the game.,5
"Game literally won't work. Tells me to update but when it takes me to the Play Store, the only options are ""uninstall"" and ""open."" Reinstalling does nothing and support gives a useless canned response.",1
My favorite gacha.,5
"This game is top notch!.. Really have no complaints. Always something to do it seems.. Graphics are great, gameplay is awesome. Simply put.. I love it.",5
Don't trust poor reviews. Fun game!,5
"Wyrmprints having a higher rate of appearance than characters or dragons. No other way to obtain X character other than summon. You have to whale really hard to get what you want and even then, you still won't get it. Drop this game.",3
Love it fun and good story base game and lots of intresting characters,5
Ya Ya Ya Ya,5
"Targeting goes out of control when re-positioning, game targets enemies furthest away instead of closest and attacking, enemies have unavoidable attacks because inhumanly fast or rolling in the game is terrible. End game is suffering more of the same raid type ordeal that led to that point cept harder cuz you bring your 3 potatoes to CC hell with you. Event hurdles are beyond investing time for family. Farming for leveling mats and gold especially sucks and Cytendo loves wiggling those daily 2x boosts, resource bundles, and skip tickets in front of your face.",1
Awesome game share almost the same mechanism as GBF,5
"Good graphics, lots of fun!",5
"Good graphics, smooth gameplay, lots of things to do, grindy. Quick feedback from developers with updates and bug fixes. I highly recommend this team friendly game.",5
It so Bad,1
This game sucks events waiting takes too long and the stuff you have to do.,1
This game is so addictive and fun the voice acting is flawless and even tho it takes up a bit of storage it is completely worth it the main story is amazing and perfectly done to truly appreciate this game you need to play it,5
Awesome work here!,5
The game is great but the amount of storage should be less,4
A fun little hack-and-slash romp that still requires some motor skills.,5
I now have a phone that can handle this game and it is AMAZING.,5
Make this a anime on Netflix,5
"This game is awesome, but I believe the concept should have been used to make a full fledged console game for the switch.",5
"Amazing game, but i wish they could do something about the materials in the game, it is sooooo hard to grind all day for it.",5
Excelente juego lo recomiendo,5
"This is the highest quality produced mobile game I've ever seen. Devs listen, are responsive, game is fun, easy to play as a free to play, easy to play as a whale. I can't recommend this game enough. It takes most game Dev years to deliver half the features this game came out of the gate with. Amazing job Dev and management team!",5
"I lost my favorite character, Karl, the second time I downloaded it!",5
It is very good you'll never be bored if you play this,5
Fun game,5
Good game but being disconnected so many times while co-op with others players is so annoying. Hope you can fix that.,5
"I love this game but don't have the time to describe why now, 58 hour a week job does that to ya",5
when I saw it was nintendo I got excited. but it turned out to be another generic gattcha game,2
Can not believe I wasted a day on this child game psh,1
I love it,5
Simply amazing. Just wish I had more stamina to play constantly.,5
Awesome,5
Fun time killer,5
Litty,5
"10/10 best mobile game I've played recently. Responsive devs, and no ads!",5
This game is extremely well crafted and it's tons of fun to build up a team. There are tons of characters each with their own story to tell. I also love the multilayer aspects with large boss raids,5
"This game is really good, the music is amazing, and I'm liking the game's story so far.",5
"It's a fun game that keeps getting better thanks to the great devs! A lot of grinding though, but I live for that kind of stuff.",5
Enjoyable rpg base,4
"Pretty standard mobile game, has amazing amounts of polish",5
A little cheesy story but good game,4
Good game but needs improvements,5
"Don't be fooled by all the reviews complaining about gacha. Point 1: Of course you are gonna have bad luck at some point, it's a gacha. Point 2: Five stars are NOT essential. You can get through all content in the game just fine with 4 star characters. Power is important but your skill is much more important. This is a great game people missing out on if you are a fan of anime style games.",5
Great story lovely graphics and easy to jump into. Generous with rewards and good to F2P players,5
"I picked this game up from a YouTube video but I ended up REALLY enjoying it. For it being Nintendo Mobile game I was actually surprised. The music is awesome, the characters are fun and quirky, and while the gameplay is simple and easy I don't ever find myself hating it.",5
"Overall this game is fantastic, I'm not a big mobile gamer but this really is a fun game. The IAPs are a bit expensive, though they aren't needed to have a good time and progress at a steady pace. Tons of updates and great breadth of content. Check it out if you're into action RPGs.",5
It's fun,5
Pretty Good Game,5
Great game,5
Its good too be new compared too so old and borin gamez....,5
Best developers and a gacha game that is actually awarding. Skill based also!,5
Says update needed and sends me to play store but play store has no update.,2
Keep it nice :thumbsup:,4
This game is so fun. I love the storyline and the little side stories. I highly recommend this game.,5
Melee sick,5
How is it this good,5
One of the best mobile games I've ever played. Very fair and fun. Definitely recommend!,5
"The precision of the controls and the time it takes to load definitely need work. But all in all it's a pretty solid experience! I love how well the game commits to all of the characters. Everyone is so unique and lively. I've never connected with a hero as much as I do with Euden (well, maybe with Link, but shoosh).",4
So far so awesome,5
5 star developers,5
"So far I'm enjoying it. Not sure about how ptw it will be, but so far it seems to be pretty giving with its rewards after each quest. The voice acting is done well and the story has been engaging thus far",5
"Downloaded the game and it keep asking for an update, sending me back to the google store for nothing. Cant even play the game.",1
A+,5
Extremely high quality game and a dev team that truly aims to please the community. Been playing everyday since launch.,5
To simply put it this is one of the best games on phone,5
"Amazing music, beautiful art, addictive and fun. Havent been hooked on a game like this before.",5
Cute characters. Generous free rewards. Frequent updates and reasonably attentive developers. Pretty cream of the crop for games of this genera. Easy to stay free to play.,5
My cup of tea and fun,5
I am having connections issues would rate higher if I didn't have that issue,1
Everyone must play this game,5
"Great rpg, loads of fun, addicting, play with your friends, build a team, the possibilities are endless!",5
Dope,5
"Good time killer. Devs listen to the players and are constantly adding new content. Yeah you can spend money if you want, but it's not really necessary to enjoy the game.",5
Alot better den most games you can download for the frizzle,5
"Great game. Only bad thing is the summon rates are terrible. If they would put the units, wrymprints and dragons. In there own summon pulls it would be better.",3
A gacha game I actually enjoy!,5
Play it its good,5
Good,5
Good graphics and good story line so far.,5
"Great game, amazing storyline.",5
Great game,5
Super fun.,5
Gets to 100% then says network error on OnePlus 6 Android 9 (oxygen 9.0.2),1
A good rpg to pass the time. They also have great leveling events about every 2 weeks so getting leveling materials is easy.,5
"A RPG lovers nostalgic dream. When playing this, you're given a full blown Mobile RPG that was on handhelds and the GC, bit now its a rpg that goes right back to the very roots where Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest once stood. Simple combat, simple controls, with even harder team building. This game mixes up with certain elements of the normal rpg tropes and fuses it with today's modern RPGs such as collecting summons of dragons, monsters and cards while using a bit of gumball machine mechanics. The game is never cluttered as everything is VERY straight forward. But for veterans, its complex as well",5
Day dragon doe,5
"Is a fun game but the few complain or suggestion i have is 1. we need higher limit for stamina and and wings. Especially later mission need like 25 stamina or three wings a try. 2. We need mana gather mission, we have gold star and ruby mission but no mana gather mission. 3. We need higher gathering missions. The current ones are too low and gather too few materials. Fix these issues then it will be more worthwhile to play.",4
This game is super addicting!!!! Love it!,5
"Great game, getting 1500 wyrmite can be tough though",5
Great game,5
"Best game and storyline I ever played. It's free to play unless you want to pay but it's very unnecessary. Graphics and gameplay is amazing, I'm 100% excited for the next storyline",5
"Great graphics, music, and some voice acting. Gameplay is decent, not amazing or bad, but serviceable. This is a Gatcha game ultimately, but the Gatcha hasn't been too but important since the story and events offer you characters and items that are pretty good. Needs more content and a higher flow of Wyrmite per day. End game feels grindy for just improving a couple characters by meager amounts like .5% HP.",5
"It's fun once you can actually play, it takes a very long time to download and then more updates before you can do anything. Some of the tutorials take forever to unlock and could be a little bit more clear. The story is interesting with lots of room to grow. It reminds me of a game called Kings Knight but with better dungeons. The graphics are very nice.",5
Fun game and no adds is a huge plus,5
"VERY well done game for what it is. Very impressed, and wish to see more to come!",5
"Silly, fun, addicting",5
LOOOOVEITPOGCHAMP,5
I love this game. Cygames deserves all my money,5
Although it is ever expanding. It is the best game I have ever played:),5
This is the best,5
"Great devs, that's enough said and a very polished game.",5
Excellent,5
Awesome,5
Awesome thank you very much,5
I love it so far.,5
Amazing game,5
Fun time killer,5
Developer is super responsive to the feedback given by the community all over the world.,5
"Fun game, cute characters!",5
Amazing per registered amazing on a 4k display,5
This game is the best game ever :),5
its a good game feels like watching anime. reminds me of Legend of Zelda Wind Waker. for some reason and I like that hope to see more,5
"Devs addressed most of the launch problems. Gacha rates are sucky still, although the 3* & 4* are very serviceable and oftentimes cooler than the 5*. The characters are cute, and the game is translated well.",4
Nintendo using gambling rates gacha that includes multiple entities...most are useless? What? Family friendly? BS... Was fun gameplay at first...downhill from there.,2
Best mobile game ever,5
Fun game all around,5
I love it,5
Very fun game,4
Awesome game,5
Dragalia Lost cured my gambling addiction.,5
Love it an everything it an the short sense they have like a mini show great graphics.,5
Very good,5
Nintendo has finally created something I can't put down since I played Golden Eye 007 on the N64. Well done Nintendo! I recommend this game to any and all game lovers out there.,5
"Love the gameplay, characters and the music. Really entertaining and the developers have really made an effort to support the community and improve the game",5
Excellenté,5
It's fun so far,4
Graphics are great and the story line is very good! Gameplay is very easy too.,5
"THEVART IS SO CUTE! Menu ui/ux is a little dense, thats common in Japanese mobile games but this one is slightly easyer to navigate and you get used to it.",5
Well polished and fun!,5
Devs that actually listen to feedback. SSR game!,5
I've never played a better mobile game. The design is really polished and the developers are really responsive to feedback,5
This game is simply amazing !,5
"The developers of the game have continued to listen to the community about outstanding problems,issues, and ways to improve the game and have shown tremendous effort to improve the game by providing players with constant updates and announcements regarding the game's status. I hope to see this continued willingness to listen to the community moving forward.",5
Great game 5\5 really nails the old dragon fantasy well and breaths some new life into it.,5
"The art, music & combat style of the game is a breath of fresh air compared to most gachas on the NA market. They don't skimp on much on this game & has a great hook of a story & in depth characters that doesn't feel like the shallow kiddie pool of other mobage storylines ( I'm looking at you Fire Emblem Heroes ). At the current point in the game the ""need"" for 5* adventurers is lesser as the power of the 4* character is fairly comparable which is nice to see. Though time will tell if Cygames & Nintendo decide to keep up this trend. To top it all off, the developers actually reach out to the community & listen to our feedback. This recent update today stands as testament. My only qualms with the game is how rare Eldwater ( a resource that lets you upgrade your units a * ) is & well the current gacha rates. But as stated above, the need for a 5* is not so much though appreciated. In all the game is a blast to play & I've already sunk so many hours into it to the point I'm neglecting other mobages.",5
"I would love to play it, it has amazing graphics! And a nice story, but... Every. Single. Stage. Needs storage. If you have huge storage, sure, but I just... WHY? EVERY OTHER COMPANY DOES THIS RIGHT!? BUT NINTENDO, THE BEST GAME MAKER IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, CAN'T MAKE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD EVERY SINGLE STAGE!?!?",2
The progression in the game feels amazing. The music is amazing. The characters are cool and the rates are not bad at all. The gameplay is fun. And most importantly the devs actually listen to the community.,5
Very awesome game. Love it,5
A joy to play.,5
Great fun. Don't let gaga rates deter you.,5
Some better more in depth tutorials would be helpful. Otherwise very nice game so far.,4
"Best communication from Devs on any mobile game I have ever played. Fun story, easy controls that are improving with every update, this game is worth the time to try.",5
Very fun! It's a great battery eater too. Make sure you have plenty of battery before playing,5
Love it,5
Good game,5
Solid gacha game.,5
The graphics and characters are amazing the controls are a little out of my style but I can manage. Other than that I love this game,5
Fun game random thing don't work but when it working it's great,4
"Extremely polished, fun, and fair real-time action rpg with a developer that actually listens to player criticisms and implements fixes quickly. Everything about the game excels over other mobile hero collector games. All the music is so upbeat that you can't help but smile as you go in an adventurer with the characters of Dragalia Lost! I highly recommend giving this game a shot!",5
"Great game, love the story and characters, just need to get a new phone to run it smoothly",5
The first in the next generation of summoning games.,5
官方肯傾聽玩家意見,5
Fun game with great developer communication. Feels the game creators actually care about feedback and try to improve.,4
This game is addicting and amusing. Stories and characters are appealing! I love it so much,5
Excellent updates so far Cygames!,5
Top,5
It's a great addictive and fun game,5
"Not only is the gameplay and visuals top notch for a free to play game, but the story is actually compelling, and all of the characters are fleshed out. There's no feeling that you have to spend money on this game, because every unit is usable as long as you put in the effort toward building them. And to top it all off, the creator is extremely vocal with what he wants out of the game, and is constantly rebuilding it based on the feedback received from the players. In short, the game is amazing, and the person who made it is very in touch with the player's opinions. Absolutely spectacular.",5
"Was 1 star, but they've been updating the game and now it's waaay better and more enjoyable to play",5
Really fun so far... fyi zoom out makes it easier to see with your finger in the way.,5
help I did an update and everything is now in Japanese!! Update now it seems ok weird glitch I guess,5
I LOVE IT SO MUCH😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,5
Really fun game with the co-op stuff. The devs are actually amazing as far as these games go in terms of addressing player feedback.,5
"This game is so much fun. I love every events they provide and easy to kill time 😂 I play while at work sometimes, just do Auto Enable. Adventurous Story! Awesome and addictive.",5
It's a fun game.,5
Really is a fun all around game. The events really give a sense of progress,5
Best part is the Farmville mode.,4
Glorious. Utterly glorious.,5
"Gameplay feels fresh, enough events and free items to shy away from micro purchases.",5
"Great game, cygames is receptive to feedback and many quality of life issues are being addressed quickly. Events are fun and loyalty characters are a great.",5
Best Dev staff for a gacha game by far. Amazing gameplay and generous pulls really help make it worth the time. Constant improvements and bug fixes.,5
Pretty good game. I had my reservations but its definitely worth it. Keep up the good work.,5
Best waifu game,5
It's fun so far. Just kinda weird it tells you you're downloading data for every level. But it only takes a second or two.,4
Moar dragons please,5
Love the game,5
I think u guys should do an HD version for the Nintendo Switch 👍👍🙏,5
"Awesome game and loving the QoL changed made by the developers addressing complaints, keep it upp!",5
"I'm hooked, really fun and easy to play.",5
Great game Nintendo like always,5
Amazing!!,5
It's aight. So far. Hoping it gets more interesting.,4
"For a hero collection game, it has a well crafted story and a great overall all effort. It certainly is worth trying out.",4
Its a fun RPG adventure,5
A fun addictive game. I only wish I could play offline.,4
"Great game, just make sure you have storage on your device.",5
Fun af,5
Awesomeness,5
Good,5
Not ur average mind less mobile game good story and best of all it lets u play instead of watching it play itself good game from the pros,5
Its fun,5
Ethan,5
awsome,5
This game is a amazing game. It is fun to play it and the story is interesting. They are adding stuff often and are working on the story too.,5
It's awesome but take a lot of data almost like a full console game.,5
The quality we have come to expect from Nintendo. The story has the potential to be a console game.,5
Gr8,5
"I love the game but I would like the option to be female like instead of being the prince and be the princess, there are a few glitches with the animations but I really like this game!",3
Trash,1
Its good but a bit slow...thats cause of my phone though,5
Great game,5
"Pretty good gameplay, you can easily make any character good with enough time",5
Lit,5
So fun! Dungeon crawly chibi Diablo,5
"Great game, but it keeps asking me if I want to quit a mission while I'm in the middle of it without hitting any of the buttons, and if I'm hosting a group, it kicks everybody out of the group",4
"Fun game, easy to play",4
Movement is a bit clumsy,4
"Smooth gameplay, satisfying 4 player coop, beautiful art, decent gameplay loop, lots of events.",5
Awesome gameplay wish this was for the switch,5
Solid game with a good story and no ads from what I can tell so it's already a winner,5
I think the game is a great mobile game but I wish there was something like it on a nintendo console I want to explore more of this world on something with a controller,5
"While the 3D chibi style and some songs are not my personal liking, gameplay, systems, voice acting and 2D designs is good enough to make me continue and enjoy this game.",4
Love it! Great story! Would make a great anime.,5
Nooooice,5
Lame,1
"Amazing game, fun way to make time pass by, would definitely recommend to my friends",5
Interesting and pretty.,5
Fun game!,5
Awesome Game 5*****,5
Good.,5
It's a fun game,5
Perfect,5
Great time waster✊🏾,5
Overall great. The gacha is a bit painful because wyrmprints arent compelling or interesting and have the highest drop rate,4
It's good,4
It is fun to play with .,5
"Good game, a combat takes some getting used to to, for me anyway, I like the whole system tho, upgrading and whatnot is done well. I don't really care much for the story but there is one, and that's super cool.",4
Its a great game its addicting and you need to play it your self,5
Authentication Failure!,3
Great Music!,5
Good,5
great game,5
I like this game but the amount of time you have to download things is quite exhausting. Its very good tho.,3
Honestly way better then it has any right being. I usually hate phone games but this one is fantastic,5
One of the best dragon games so far that I've played,5
The fact alone that they were able to make a dungeon crawler of this quality on your phone speaks volumes alone. The fact that it's so much fun speaks even more. Love this game!,5
"Fun, I don't think i've hit the pay wall yet though.",5
Full of story line which is a nice change for a mobile game.,5
Great,5
Cool concept game. Great graphics. Overall great game.,5
"Game is great. Although I'm a little tired of the ""draw cards for team members and level them up with items instead of gameplay experience,"" this is better than most games who use that concept.",4
It a fun game though I wish it wasn't a game that has stamina,5
"The controls are simple, easy to learn, hard to master. The story is engaging. You can clearly tell everyones personalities by the way they talk. Even the art style is fantastic, better than a lot of modern PC games.",5
👍👍👍👍👍,5
Amazing game. Pull rate are some of the worst I have ever experienced in a game,4
Great game that is pretty generous with resources,5
👍,5
Great game,4
Pretty good so far. No complaints. Looks good plays well.,4
It's awesome,5
It's a very fun game I love it a lot!,5
"Nintendo's continued branching out into the mobile market is paying off. While it isn't very deep, Dragalia Lost is a complete RPG experience on mobile. Its simple acton gameplay is satisfying for a quick fix and is a breath of fresh air in a market of copycat match-3 RPGs and card battle games.",5
Fun time killer,5
Really fun and interesting to keep unlocking strong characters,5
Good,5
very good game,5
"I thoroughly enjoy this game.The gacha elements may be a bit daunting to people new to the genre, but you'll get used to submitting to RNGesus. The game is well put together, the soundtrack is amazing, the characters are (mostly) well written and there's always something that keeps you playing. I've had this game since Day 1 and I've logged in every day since then. I highly recommend you try it.",5
"The controls and gameplay are really fun, but the pity rate for a 5 star is extremely low, and the game is pretty laggy in general (though that might just be me)",3
"Very fun and nostalgic game. Love the animation, the game play, music. Pretty great though memory heavy.",5
Good,5
"Leveling up your characters doesnt really matter. You need special items to level up your equipment and you have to combine them at max level in order to get to the next tier. The items are farmed by using in game currency to buy a limited amount of them, three to be exact, each day. Stupid.",2
"Vary fun game, controls will take a little bit of time to get use to.",5
Awesome,5
"Lot's of handy performance features, and many stories woven into every aspect of the game.",4
Great game enjoying the storyline and the characters amazing graphics keep up the great work Nintendo,5
Pretty fun,4
An excellent game,5
Great game to come out for mobile as a game designer this one is good,5
nice game,5
This game could have been on the switch and it's only the beginning,5
recieved a user authentication failed report. if this can be fixed I'll change my rating,1
"Everythings good but its annoying that you have to keep downloading almost every level. Ig you have limited space, be ready yo delete some stuff off your phone",4
Just started this game and I'm already hooked. The controls are a bit difficult but otherwise everything is great.,4
Really like everything so far. Just wish the UI had all your characters across the bottom so you could just tap an ability to cast it or tap a character to control them. Slowly scrolling through your party one by one to get to a healing spell in a pinch is killer.,5
One word or two LOVE IT!!,5
Its the awesomes Nintendo game I played,5
Feels good for the most part. I really enjoy it gives you a summary if you wanna skip story stuff. Menu feels laggy but overall good game for mobile.,4
It's a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Pretty graphics and great story!,5
nice,5
Awesome graphics and I like the story so far. Its alot to download but worth it tho. I'll update often,5
Very well made for free,5
Amazingly polished game. Can't wait for it to evolve!,5
People are going afk during raids. Need a way to report them please.,5
Best,5
The story is very intriguing. I like it,4
Z good but short,5
I love this game. Another one of nintendo's masterpieces,5
Very Simple and fun to play,5
"I really loved the game, eventually it got repetitive and I tend to get bored with games that are long and repetitive. But a beautifully well made game all around",5
It yo boi me give me Nintendo switch please,5
PLEASE HEED MY WARNING the game was soooo boring I was bored about three minutes into it and I got so tired of the flipping game I deleted it right after. Please don't waste your time downloading this heap of actual garbage.,1
"Very fun gameplay so far, great graphics",5
I love it but only prob is the constant downloading takes up a lot of space,5
Very addicting great graphics,5
Good game!!!!!!!!,5
Good story and completely satisfying for the standards of a phone game. Only thing is very large file size,5
"I keep having disconnect issues when trying to play co-op, game runs just find when i play solo. I know my inyernet isnt the issue, my in home wifi isnt 5-star bit it runs everything in my house without issue, and no other game suffers like this on my phone. I wonder why this keeps happening?",3
Beasty ass game yo...,5
It's Divine,5
It is excellent game to play,5
Fun game,5
"Lots of downloads, is a little frustrating.",4
Love this game,5
funfast paced with interesting characters and abilities. Definitely worth a try.,5
The game is really fun and really addicting.,5
"Great game so far. Beautiful graphics, interesting story and easy to learn controls and gameplay. A little grindy, but better than most games. However, there are a few small issues that I would like to address; first, the controls are wonderful, but need to be more sensitive. It can be difficult to turn and dodge. Second, the game lags even when connected to wifi. Especially during co-op. Some stability improvement is needed. Lastly, the gatcha system is dangerously leaning toward all those money hungry gatchas from other games. I would suggest either lowering the summoning price, making wyrmite more easily obtainable (in small quantities) or raising the chance for higher starred characters/new characters that the player doesn't own. Keep up the good work, Nintendo! Don't become like all those brands hated for their greed and your loyal fans and customers will stay loyal!",3
Keeps giving me an authentification error 400 every single time I open it.,1
This a perfect game that is amazing.,5
Can't stop playing 😃,5
Great and fun,5
Amasing game,5
It's a great game with a great story and plot,4
I'm loving it so far,5
Dragons are litty,5
Great mobile rpg almost feels like a console game,4
By far one of the greatest mobile games i have ever played and whats even better is the fact that its an rpg.,5
It could be better if it didnt take so much space,5
It's a fun cute game,5
絵も可愛いし、ゲームもかなりサクサク動くので快適。,5
Love it! Great graphics and wonderful voice overs,5
Its pretty good,5
Its too big for some phone's,5
"The one bad thing is it use alot of memory, but I love playing this game. I wish i could find more games with graphics like this.",5
Why do the levels download why?,4
The game is very fun to play,5
"Fun game, well done. The biggest complaint is the difficulties in navigation. Aside from that, great title.",5
Its great but you have to download every time,5
Cool,5
"Good game, an immersive storyline and tons of cool features",5
Great,5
love it,5
Gg,5
It's very good,5
My balls itch. While i was playing the game my balls were itchy so i rubbed the a lil bit and then my dog with his bagging pecks deleted the app so ign rates my balls itch out of ten its no nut november,4
Amazing game,5
"A quality game, a nice mix of skill and modern ""summoning"" systems.",5
Only drawback is the stamina but I guess that prevents people from playing all day ;) Fun and cute!,5
"I love this game. Granblue Fantasy 2: Nintendo Boogaloo was already fun to me when the game launched, and the fact that Cygames has done a fantastic job addressing issues and fixing them, including retroactively handing out stuff that should have been given out when they fixed something. That's fantastic support! I know they can be counted on to keep the game running, as I play some of the other games they run. I feel like the premium currency is too expensive, but the game is completely playable F2P as I've only purchased the welcome pack and have been able to clear all content so far. It's a bit grindy and kusoges aren't for everyone but those that enjoy a little action packed gameplay with a steady grind will feel right at home.",5
I wont load up it sux,1
Love the game,5
"Fun, nice story, you can tell they put a lot of details into making this game",5
It's cute and combat system is very responsive.,5
"I absolutely love this game!!! Great voice acting, an interesting story, and amazing graphic is everything I expected of this I hope this gets a console release with an open world and all that cause this is a great game.",5
Make a better game Nintendo,1
"Very lovely story, even though it dies take a lot of storage space..",5
"First impressions are good with this game. I am entertained, and will update this review as I spend more time in the game.",5
A very fun game . Good graphics . Good story . In app prices are good . Over all my only complaint is how you move the characters around . Also space . This app eats space like crazy so be prepared to sacrifice some things . None the less great game .,5
S'dope mah dudes,5
One of the best mobile games I've ever played,5
"Great game,great story",5
Great game as expected from Nintendo,5
Pretty fun you might like it if you try it,5
Great and addicive!,5
So cool,5
Its good but i cant get my account back and i was playing this game nonstop please help me get it back,3
A challenging 3D game,5
Great graphics,4
"Controls are awkward, pull rates for 'good' heroes/dragons are abysmal, the story is mediocre and incomplete, and events are massive grind fests. If you have nothing to do it'll kill time, but even doing an entire day's worth of tasks to get rewards will require you to play multiple times a day or purchase stamina recovery items.",1
Good,5
I love this game so much I hope you make an anime out of it keep up the good work and good luck,5
Loved it,5
I like the coop mode,5
It's a fun game where you build up your team.,5
One of best mobile rpg I've played,5
Dragons cooooool,5
Good story and graphics,5
Great gameplay and fantastic story really brings this game to amazing gaming experience,5
Very nice,5
I really enjoy the game is very fun and I love the colors and the graphics the only problem I have is sometimes the downloading is really slow,5
It's awesome,5
Love it! Yay Nintendo!,5
Lol,5
This is for all you digimon pokemon nerds out there,5
"Runs well even on an old phone, good graphics and controls, and an interesting story",5
"Its fun for a while, but the separation of free and paid currency feels bad. They also add a type of equipment (wyrm prints) to the gatcha which dilutes the pool and feels horrid when you get a 5* and it turns out to be one of those.",3
Really great mobile rpg. About what you would expect from Nintendo and Cygames.,5
Good stories well put together,5
"Much better from the launch, controls are much smoother and gameplay is simple yet fun and addicting",5
Dragon lost is sp cool and realistic I like it!,5
It is very well done and the music is amazing. Voice acting is really good for a free mobile game.,5
It's not for everyone. The dev team has made some improvements since launch but outside of the first few days events you're trapped in a loop of grinding the same maps in order to improve your character and in event you're trapped in a loop of playing the same map over and over for rewards. The story is generic anime but there's a lot of it so it's not overall terrible. Can't talk about the music since I haven't had sound on.,3
Fun game. Hope microtransactions don't get in the way soon. The,4
"The game was okay and kind of generic, but the data restore is broken. They tell you to link your game to your Nintendo account, which I did. But then when I switched to my new phone, all of my data is gone. I've tried to talk to their customer service for over a week and I keep getting the same dismissive answer that they won't do anything and next time I should link my game to my account. I've told them over and over that I did already but they refuse to help. Worst customer service ever. Don't waste your time or money on this game because they will steal your money and try to force you to start over again. Edit: they still keep trying to blame me for their system failure. I've continued to try to get them to help. They don't even ask any questions or try to troubleshoot on their end. They just keep telling me that I must not have linked my account, even though I've told them again and again that I have. I'm just going to uninstall and give up.",1
They keep deleting my review of this game because it was negative. Can't handle criticism and a 2★ rating... pathetic.,1
It's the great game,5
"ATM best game. Its in it's early stages so there are minor bugs and tweaks to be worked out. The game is pretty generous and you can TRULY be a F2P player. So far so good. I highly recommend you give this game a try. The 4* rating means that it's a good game, just not perfect... Not yet. On a side note, if you love multiplayer games this a great way to group up with 3 friends and tackle missions/ or Raids.",4
SO MUCH FUN,5
Solid multiplayer PvE game that would benefit from better community hubs or tools like guilds.,4
Pretty good,5
"Finally, a game that's not hypersexualized. It's so cute! The music is great, and the devs actually listen. 10/10",5
This game is good. Need to adjust the co-op mode so you don't have to constantly relink with your party,4
Beautiful game,5
This game is nothing but a bunch of loading screens and downloads I realy don't hate on games but this one was just kinda annoying to me but don't let me stop you from what you like,1
I love everything about the gameplay and design. I don't love how big the install is and how it gets larger and larger the more you play.,4
"The story is original, the game play is fun and the graphics are beautiful. I'm hooked",5
Pretty interesting. I like what they implemented from fire emblem and other games,4
It won't let me click anything so I can't even play,1
Super fun and addicting!,5
Cool game to play,5
For a mobile game its pretty amazing. Its easy and fun and i feel the world has a depth i have yet to unlock.,5
Cool game 😍😎,5
Nothin,1
"I don't know what all the upset reviews are for. The game is great! Haven't spent a single cent and I've done about 7 or 8 x10 summons and a load of event summons. Only been playing about 10 days. Fun, interesting gameplay, great variety of characters, and really charming stories. Barely any glitches, which is really impressive for such a young game. I'm having a blast!",5
Rebecca Wliilams,5
Fun to play and pretty good story,5
"Difficult controls, but other than that i love it",5
It working really well and is really fun to play this game has alot of potential so dont mess it up please,5
"Fun. Sometimes the controls feel a little cramp but fun to play otherwise. Great graphics, and music.",4
I found this game to be very enjoyable and I hope you do to,5
The game is very fun! The controls are easy to get used to and the story is very good.,5
It's fun,4
Its p good but kinda overwhelming at first,4
Rates are the only problem solid game besides that,4
Love the graphics. Very entertaining concept,4
"Fun, charming, and lovable character designs. Not to far into the story but its immersive so far.",5
I like it... and I am very picky on my games if that says anything.,5
Great voice acting great production value and animations but I personally don't like the chibi look the rates are really bad and there's only one weapon that doesn't feel clunky and actually fun to use in this daggers.,4
"Great game, excellent graphics. Would be perfect if the download sizes weren't so big and it didn't disconnect all the time",4
I hate wymprints. I'm trying to get dragons and units and the game throws a thosand wymprints at you. Its kind of annoying. I really wish the wymprints either had their own summon banner or was gain some other way.,3
Havent even played it yet 5 stars if its nintendo its 5,5
WHY DOSENT IT LET ME USE MY PEN TO TAP WITH MY J3 PROME SOME PARTS OF MY PHONE NEED TO USE THE PEN AND THE GAME WONT LET MT ITS SO ANNOYING!!!!,1
Not a big anime fan but the gameplay is legit,5
It's ok so far,3
"Pretty damn good game, I will definatly wasting my time on this.",5
It was fun I definitely loved the game,5
I loved it good graphics,5
Can you combine the story cinematics with the mission or let us skip it without downloading,5
It is cool,5
Amazing! It's originl story and platform quality game play are more than anyone could ever expect from a free mobile game. Masterfully done. Secret of Mana-esque gameplay and a choice for Co-op on pretty much everything. Single character and full team for raid bosses! You should try it out ASAP!,5
It everything I thought it was!!! RPG,5
Is Gucci,5
Just started playing and it's a great game so far. Great graphics and awesome voice acting. 10/10 from me.,5
Yeah you're the best Titi in the world you're the best teaching in the world,5
Great game and story line. I like the fighting style. Just the download every chapter,5
Such a fun game. I play alot of console rpg/adventure games. So finding a phone game to hold my interest is rare. I gove this one 10 out of 10,5
"Game is addicting, looks great and love that you can play in portrait mode! Story is fun and systems can be a bit complicated, honestly slow it down and read all the tips, you will get the hang of it!",5
"Unable to play on a OnePlus 6, really Nintendo!?",1
Awesome game,5
"Great anime inspired game, recognizable casting and great graphics and gameplay",5
Good game glad I pre registered,5
Just started but great so far. Obvious that this game has a ton of polish. No issues running it. Action combat is fun.,5
Super Fun.,5
Love this and the story,5
"Very fun with a great art style. Good job, Nintendo!",5
Good game,5
"The music is the best part about the whole game, the graphics are nice and everything else about it is fantastic. THE MUSIC IS WHAT I LOVE HEARING THOUGH",5
Its a great game and i love it,5
I enjoy it. Art style and story she perty noice.,5
Play kingdom hearts,2
Its Nintendo so its amazing,5
I love this game and the songs,5
Great game if you are interested in ARPG combat on the go!,5
Great job!!,5
"Fun. Graphics are good. Just started, so I don't know how deep the Pay to Win goes. But so far it's good.",5
nintendo makes great moble games,5
This is a very good game the graphics are good and the story is great,5
This is one of my favorite mobile games ive ever played would recommend,4
Great gameplay,4
I love the GAME thanks for the good game,5
"I really enjoy the individual character stories and not needing a lot of in app purchases to play the game! I also like how there are stickers to communicate with other players and no chat. It takes away the annoying parts of an online game that I don't like and focus mainly the stories and game development. I also like the free motion of controlling the characters in battle than doing the turn taking battle. Very well done, great music and graphics!",5
Simplistic but fun. Gacha system seems fair and I see no need to spend money if only to support the devs.,5
Super,5
"Well if you're looking for something to replace GS,BF, Fog, Feh & exvius then this is it. Trust me, it's a step up especially if you're F2P",5
Yes,5
Best anniemey game 😇😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎,5
Noice,5
Game game game,5
It was and is a great game very fun new rpg style game but for me it was far too large a game for my phone,5
Its good,5
"1 word, Awesome.",4
I love this game Thanks,5
A Wonderful Fantasy Adventure,5
The developers quickly adress problems and show care and compassion to make this game stand out amongst the sea of mobile games.,5
"Grindy and highly repetitive, for all it's charm it is yet another life-eating gacha game that relies on the Skinner Box to keep you playing.",2
It has a update every load,1
It's pretty fun so far,5
"Do you know how much it cost to fully develop one single character? A LOT! That’s why I hate F2P gacha game, and this game is even worse!",1
It's still too early in the game to say it's good or not. I'll keep playing for now and see how it goes.,4
No Reinhardt. Game is too graphicy,1
Good gane,5
10 out of 10 would recommend,5
Very fun game,5
Great game play need to get comfortable with controls,4
"Corny, boring, and unoriginal.",1
It's a great game I could play hours at a time,5
It's a fun game and story is good gg Nintendo,5
"Amazing music, story and characters. I love the castle building aspect of it and the gameplay is solid. Super addictive I can see my self been stuck on this one longer than the Fire Emblem gatcha game that Nintendo has.",5
This game is WAAAAYYYYYY better than I expected it to be. If you like chibi art style this game is beautiful. I can't believe that the game is actually voice acted as well,5
It's a good quality rpg.,5
Cool stuff,5
"Game is actually fun. Wow this isnt what I expect. High quality Mobile game, for real!",5
Excellent story and writing from the creators of Shadowverse and Granblue Fantasy. Incredible music from the very talented Daoko. Gameplay is entertaining enogh to keep me playing. Very welcoming and helpful community and develepora determined to make the game better for everyone. I'm very excited to see what Nintendo will do with this new IP and I have very high hopes for the future.,5
"Cute and fun game. Good music and graphics. The controls when running around the dungeon could be better. I'd prefer to have a joystick that appears wherever you put your finger down so I can see the screen and move better. Other than that, no issues with the game so far. The character art, graphics and music are good. In game currency is easy to obtain and it's easy for free players. This game has a lot of of downloading but there's a batch download button in the settings. The gacha rates are as low as expected from a game of its kind. But the free currency being easy to obtain helps a lot",5
Awesome game,5
"Love it, best mobile game I ever played, i would recommend everyone to play this game, It's really fun.😜",5
Really good but too many loading screen time,5
I like how live it is its a new kind of game in console if it were to come to console.,5
"""you have been disconnected from the host"". EDIT: they fixed it. You no longer get kicked out of the battle when the host gets disconnected. Thank you. EDIT 2: yeah i was wrong. Please fix it. Goddamn it's infuriating to be kicked out moments before you beat the boss only because the host leaves. Stop it now. Let it continue.",4
Its awsome,5
"Streamline progression systems, enjoyable gameplay but feels a bit broken up by the longer story segments. Enjoyable if you're looking for a laid back escape!",4
Good,5
Good game,5
Good ol Nintendo. Itll hit you right in your nerdy bits. Its good stuff.,4
"The raid battles are honestly the best part of this game, the events are free play friendly, and we get a chance to summon 10x for every event!",5
Love the music and aesthetics of the game. Worth the time to try and really play it. Yea the gacha is kinda unfair... but overall a potential game that will get better in the near future!,5
Nice,5
Little bit more work,5
my game is crashing,5
That was awsome,5
Wonderful game but would prefer a joystick like option instead of a screen drag and stronger lobbies so i stop getting random support numbers.,5
Good game,5
Very fun,5
I like it because the add for the games is true to what it looks like in the game,5
Cool beans,5
Pretty solid game gameplay and controls are decent good gameplay story as I love dragons so this is a plus has some rpg story element feels,4
Good game,4
So far so good. Yet to be determined,4
Fun,5
I love the story it makes me feel good and the controls are good just make it were you can make it full screen,5
Love it good details and it has a great story.,5
A quick and simple dungeon crawler with elements that let you dive deeper into building your characters' abilities if you want.,5
It's a mobule game alright,3
So much fun,5
Easy to play and good graphics. And good story ^^,5
So far so good,5
I love the game! The graphics are amazing and the story develops so fluently!,5
I think they should add more to the game so we can keep playing this incredible stoey,5
Coooooooooool!!!,5
Oo,5
"This game is amazing in depth and gameplay. 60fps gameplay is wonderful. The gacha needs work, as you can get really unfair pulls consistently, but other than that its a lovely game.",5
"Fun, but not a huge fan of the gacha system.",4
Enjoyed the game play and story. Wonderful graphics.,5
"This is a very addicting game, great graphics and good story mode. I kind of have trouble controlling the character's movement to fight though. Other then that, 5 starz! Good job Nintendo.",4
Very fun,5
A great worker makes a great game and you are a great creator make more games like this,5
Hard to move,4
I 👍,5
"I adore everything about this game. So many heroes, so many dragons, and the fact that you can see the weapons you have equipped on your character is awesome.",5
This game is great! Thanks Nintendo for another amazing game!,5
So far so good. Decent stroyline fun gameplay. The only thing wrong is the dialogue doesn't exactly match the speed the text is on.,5
Love this game it's so fun and beautifully desgined,5
It's very Interesting and cool,5
Terrible rates. Polluted gacha pool. Asinine amount of bugs that aren't getting fixed. End game is boring. Bland characters that all play the same for their weapon type. I tried to like this game. It was supposed to be great. It's a shame how it turned out.,1
It can be fun at times amd the co-op is great but the AI of followers and the auto is so awful that I wanted to give this a one star. They stand in attacks they die and never pick up loot. If you dont play as your healer then he/she will just get melted by the bosses attacks. The bosses can be really freaking hard to so it just stinks to lose teamates to when they arent in your control. The drop rates and the amount of wyrmite you get is also terrible but the gameplay is what. Saved two out of the three stars. The other star is because changing into a dragon is just too epic.,3
I have seen some needed fix but game just feels limited because there is not much to do after reading the story and repeated same event stages and the presetup makes it so its always the same fight the only difficult thing is having to control your character as the patterns as simple to tell. Needs more content,3
A cutesy and fun rendition of the rpg genre. Easy to play for short and long periods.,5
Great fast gameplay and short so I can do other things too,5
Awwweeeesome,5
In a word SWEET,4
Great game has great graphics especially for a phone game,5
"Nice and fun, but takes up SO much space on your phone",4
Great,5
The graphics are awesome and the story is gripping.,5
"It's an amazing game with great graphics, control, and story",5
Love this game keep up the good work you should also make a beta program for this game,5
Best phone game I have played in a long time.,5
Good,5
"Very awesome, it's the only Nintendo app I own but still the best Japanese/American mobile RPG yet!!",5
Great time killer,5
It's a good game but on the wrong device. I think it would have been better to make it a full ds game instead of a game that uses up a huge chunk of space on a phone,3
Love the action rpg feel,5
"Awful summon rates, greedy with currencies, terrible controls, and basic, decent at best, graphics. Takes 60(!!) quests at 25 gems each to do a single 10x summon and that's for a 0.5% chance at a 5* character. Super lackluster game and even more so coming from Nintendo. Don't fall for the big-name brand appeal.",1
"If you spend money but don't link your account and end up having to reinstall, they WILL NOT be able to help redeem your account or even refund or replacement the items bought onto a new account. THATS BS",1
"This game is very fun, was searching for a fun, gacha game and this game was the perfect one! Would definately recommend this to others",5
This game is so much fun!,5
"a lot of fun and i loveeee the soundtrack. controls feel a bit odd but i may just need to play so more, so far its pretty good!",5
Fun,5
"Very Nice Game, Good Story As Well I Would Highly Recommend Playing This Game",5
Pretty good. The controls could be better.,4
Its a good time killer with a fun story.,4
Fun easy intriguing story,5
Intriguing so far.👌,4
Amazing game cant stop playing,5
Fun game,5
Fun and less of a freemium feel to it than most other games of this type,5
It is a thing,3
I enjoyed the game very kuch,5
Good,5
I love this game so much. Great story. Fun. Cute.,5
I love Dragalia lost it is amazing for a Nintendo mobile game.,5
I'm fustrated because of the controls. Please make a joystick option. But all n all the game is amazing,5
Gr8! Combat dodges and follow up attacks is similar to dark souls minus the repost,4
I FREAKING LOVE THE ANIMATION AND THE WHOLE GAME IN GENERAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
I lived it nintido pls make more like this but free on phones Ps. Thanks for making it,5

Controls are a little laggy But every thing else OK,5
Yay anime,4
A fantastically well_put together gacha RPG that is improving all the time.,5
Overall a very great feeling game to play. So far has a decent story and it's quite generous with the premium currency.,5
Great co-op gameplay,5
Pretty good so far.,4
Why doesn't it work?!?!?!?!?,1
Best time waster around. I don't put any money into it and it's still rewarding,5
Is gr8,5
Awesome game with easy controls and great graphics,5
"I enjoy the game, though sometimes the directional controls can be a little difficult .",4
This is game is fun,4

Awesome game add more quests to the game very soon,5
I will always play this game forever really loved it,5
Great game,5
It's preety good wish the controls were better,5
Transform into a dragon... sign me up!,5
"It may be a mobile game, but it's a beautiful and amazing game with a compelling story. Exactly what you'd expect from Nintendo. I applaud everyone who worked on the game, as it's my favorite mobile game of 2018.",5
Love FE heros 2,5
Damn good so far,5
It's got good graphics and I love the one handed system but I don't like having to download every time I want to do a chapter wish it was one big download then your done,4
I love this game.nentendo really outdid it's self this time.the garaphics in this game just puts me in aw!,5
"In an age where mobile online dungeon crawlers exist. Nintendo has failed to grasp the fundamentals of fluidity in mobile gaming when it comes to gameplay on a touchscreen. You'll find yourself awkwardly running and trying to attack, fighting against the stiff animations and disjointedness of moving and attacking m",2
Good game but the character's are black and colorless plz fix,4
"Looked at the total download, it said 80+ meg. I downloaded it. 800+ meg for the tutorial and another 1G to actually play. Don't have that room on my device. Uninstalled the game :(",1
I like the graphics and art but I think their should be more harder battles,4
Awesome,5
Best phone game on ftp market,5
Dragons and Japanese dub cutscenes. My kind on game,5
Dragalia Lost is EXCELLENT! Really enjoying it. I especially love the character design and catchy music!,5
Fantastic ARPG with some of the best gameplay in a mobile game ever!,5
Great game,5
Since they fixed the sensitivity for using force strikes the game now feels like it controls really well. The company seems to really be listening to consumer feedback so that's a huge plus as well.,5
The music for this game is too hype. Please keep it goin',4
"Quite a good game, interactive and let's you move around on a map, the sound is crisp as well.",5
"Love it! If i was to give critic, the controls could be a little bit better.",5
F2P friendly with generous developer. Can clear game content with 3* and 4* adventurers. Very rewarding grind.,5
It is a basic hack and slash with the occasional dragon transformation.,4
Great game just started playing and it's so fun,5
"Bad rates and combined gacha (for 3 things no less). Controls are bad and auto is quite terrible. Just all around repulsive to someone who has played any other other game in this genre. The only good things are the art and ost. Sorry, but this really missed the mark.",2
Good action rpg mobile game. Gacha system can use improvement but at least heroes are pretty balance so you can f2p no problem.,5
Awesome,4
Pretty nice that I can play with other players,5
It'd be nice if the full game was downloaded at once instead of chunks right after installing it,3
Good I like it. One of Nintendo's best.,4
It's a really great game and I love the story,5
Lovin this game,5
Great job! A mobile game with Voice Actors! Great gameplay as well!,5
Amazing game would reccomend,5
It is awesome.,5
Honestly if this game was a switch game or 3DS game I wouldn't mind spending 40-60 bucks on this because it's just been a really enjoyable experience. Controls are really good (when you consider it's a mobile game) and the fact there's even multiplayer makes this a complete package. Playing with friends is a good time,5
Great game,5
It's a bit slow at times but a very good game.,5
Addictive and fun would recommend,5
It's not working for me anymore. I was having fun untill it gave me a error. I had to uninstall it😢,1
I like the fighting style of the game and its smooth game play,4
"Addicting action rpg with a lot of good elements from other games. Examples are resource management/income from buildings, weapon crafting, and events. The developers are also listening to the community feedback and making really good changes to the game.",5
Very solid mobile game. Great art. Interesting story. Don't know why it's getting poor reviews.,5
It has music from daoko 10/10,5
Noice,5
"Amazing character art and simple mindless gameplay... great for relaxing and wasting the time, you know?",5
Quite amazing it takes a nostalgic classic Nintendo RPGs and turns it into a modern expensive story that's very immersive and fun to play good job on this one Nintendo,5
"Love it so far! Not sure why there are so many negative reviews? I've gotten a ton of wyrmite from just playing the game and I've gotten two 5 star dragons the gacha is fair. Also love pretty much everything else, music, graphics, story, gameplay is also fun. Great job Nintendo! Can't wait for future updates.",5
663 MB needed to download???Too bad!,1
"I'd push my rating back up, but I haven't been able to log in today or last night",1
It has a really good story and the controls are easy.,5
FAN-FLIPING-TASTIC,5
"incredible that two game companies with so much experience making good mobile games could make such a disappointing one. controls horribly, abyssmal gacha rates, unbearable and constant load times, poor functionality in every facet, slow progression, and to top it all off, the dragons that are the main selling point dont even show up much. you can pretty much only ever summon 1 of the ones equipped per quest and since its always going to be your strongest, the others might as well not exist.",2
Fun and addictive,4
Love it,5
The hardest boss in the whole game is DAOKO....that OST tho,5
Great mobile game from Nintendo. The story is rich enough that you feel no pressure to rush or grind. If you think this is a grind you've never played a Korean MMO. Really like the way they developed this game.,5
good,5
Lots of stopping to download. Can't flip screen so hard on the power cord of phone for gaming,3
It good,5
Great game,5
"I would appreciate a number on the space this thing will eventually take up. It makes you download more about every mission, but as long as you are on Wifi it's no problem. Absolutely amazing game. Much more advanced than most mobile apps",5
"While the swipe controls are a little wonky, it's very easy to play. As expected of the makers of CyGames, the game is full of beautiful art!",5
"Love it. If you make it more better, I'll love it more.",5
It's a good game,5
Movement controls are the only thing I have to complain about.,4
Great game going to get it on the switch!!!,5
The developer has been listening to feedback and making great improvements since launch. Most of the launch complaints have been dealt with or are being dealt with.,5
Another great Nintendo mobile game.,5
Control need improvement hard to dodge and switchbetween characters,5
Addictive gameplay. Way better than Diablo can hope to be.,5
I'd suck this games dick,5
its a fun drag and tap game good story and gameplay,5
Its great I never played an app game like this before,5
Very well made and fun!,5
Game is fun But the summon rates are horrendous. I've been through 4 banners and have yet to get 1 five star unit,3
Awesome graphics and easy to play,5
Fun,5
Fun way to kill time,5
I love it hands down my favorite Mobile game of all time. Thanks Nintendo!!!!,5
Great fun collecting stuff game. My favorite part is feeding my weak dragons to my powerful ones for experience.,5
I loved the game but i didnt get super far in the game because it made me download so much my phone would crash everytime i tried to boot the game up but other than that its an awesome game so if you want to play it you better have a lot of storage on your device 😀,5
"I love this game! Hands down the best mobile game Nintendo has put on the play store recently! Very well made game, with some great story to it. Controls are a little iffy, but you get used to them for the most part. There are in app purchases, but it's entirely doable to play the game and have a lot of fun with it without spending money, which I respect a lot.",5
"Wow I only got to play the first stage and it was great. This was the closest thing to a legend of the dragoons present day version I was ever going to get, but requires just a bit to much memeory for my phone. Not holding that agenst you either. Really wanted to see the chocabo I got from summoning in action, sorry roc. Talk about a demo game didn't give me any trouble, lost 2hp, don't remember anything hitting me. All in all hope this is a game on switch so I can play it.",4
The rates are horrible and watered down with what are essentially accessories. Sub-1% for 5 star characters. They can afford to be generous when the rates are horrible.,1
Lost the ability to buy gems so and after 3 weeks of going back and forth with support decided to reinstall and lost my save,1
Intrigued since day one,5
It was better than I expected.,5
I love the game. The story is compelling and the controls are easy to understand. However make sure to have plenty of space on your phone.,5
Fun great game,5
"Controls feel like ass. Far older games that have better graphics and controls that aren't Nintendo. Plays in long way which isn't a problem until you have to move to sides in which case camera sees absolutely nothing. Biased but majority of English dubs are terrible, this one had some characters that weren't awful but main character was. Yet to find 1 decent mobile game from Nintendo yet truly disappointing.",2
"Terribles rates. 3 pool in one banner. Characters and Dragons are 0.5% while Wyrimprints (Basically Fate Grand Order Craft Essences) is 1%. Pity system is nice until you get another Wyrimprints. So unless they change future banners where they all have seperate banner, the game gatcha system is trashs. Controls are trash because there is no landscape mode. Everything is vertical so good luck fat fingers (like me). Music, Arts, and Graphic is neat. Which is the only good thing about it. Also it take lots of space 2.6gb and can warm your old model phones. Invest if you got nothing but stay away if you already occupied by other gatcha games. Edit 1: It been a month and this will be the only gatcha where i change my score. Control is way better than before but force strike mechnic is clunk. Rates are still trashes. The biggest change for the scores is that the DEV listen to feedback and are willing to improve. This in my book can make any 1 star into 5 star.",4
No no,1
Very high quality game and devs listen to the community to constantly improve the game.,5
Would be better if not as many down load points.,5
A lil long for loading but love the game over all,5
Really fun jrpg app,4
"I have to admit I genuinely like and enjoy this game. The visuals, coupled with the vocals and rhythmic soundtrack have me hooked. Thanks for the game.",5
Great support and quality of life changes by the dev team,5
Hmm it's great but I'm picky,5
Artwork is nice and gameplay is pretty fun. Downloading can be buggy at times and the rates of rare units seem pretty low but right now I'm willing to give the game 4*,4
Fun so far! Only two days in.,5
Great storyline voice overs and gameplay fluent. So far so good keep at it,5
It's okay,5
Great game,5
Im having fun,5
Great fun like it alot,5
Great game! Nintendo hit a home run with this one!,5
Not bad,5
Great story vary entertained,5
First time playing this and it's a good game,4
One of the best app games I ever played Nintendo did it again,5
Couldn't even update it. Every time at 100% update fails,1
Three Life,5
Its ight,5
Good game but the controls are bad. This was really made to be played with a controller,4
Very nice,5
It is very fun.,5
excellent game,5
This game is awesome!!,5
Short lvls mean quickly getting into it. It reminds me of (breath of fire) games! I friggin loved those games!,5
"Just downloaded it a few days ago. So far, not bad.",4
Great game except for the multiple downloads you have to go through and you also cant attack and move at the same time. Still a great game in all.,4
Good,5
Great game,5
Dope,5
Really fun love the transformations,5
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5

Awesome keep up the great work,5
Good so far,4
Its great,5
Super fun game,5
I loved the gameplay,4
Because it good,5
"Very fun, cute. Reminds me of the final fantasy crystal chronicle games x fire emblem heroes. I love the music ! Plays well! I'm enjoying it thus far!",5
Just download it I will give more feedback when I get a full on approach of the game.,5
The only thing dragalia lost is lacking is more decorations for the halidom.,5
"Aside from the massive downloads that aren't really mentioned up front, it's fun, functional and a potential classic. The graphics are great, and the layout is super clean.",5
I LOVE IT It's So FUN!!!!,5
Good all around,5
Very fun so far,5
10/10,5
Great Story,5
BEST GAME OF THE YEAR,5
Good,5
Its awesome and legendary,5
This game is addictive and it is impossible to put down. It feels almost worthy of being a console game!,5
This game is a lot of fun,5
Good,5
Great game you should try it.,5
Fun game can't stop playing it,5
I think it's a really good game and you should add more to it!,5
I love how this gameplays I like the storyline and when you turn into a dragon,5
That the game is very good at quality,5
It is a cool gomenit runs well with your phone,5
"This is a great game but like any gacha game out there they make it too difficult for those who can't afford to spend money. It's really incredible to farm the currency to do one pull and then the rates are so ridiculously bad even with a pity meter. They tell people about the pity meter to make them think you'll eventually get something good but in reality they fill the gacha with so much useless garbage you may proc the pity meter and get some useless 5* card. Not a character, not a dragon but a damn card.",2
Fun and characters are unique.,5
"Great game, and a beautiful job by nintendo, but i have only one complaint. The teams AI is so bad at dodging attacks in dragon fights, but theyll dodge traps perfectly. Please fix this, as its hard to get all three fleur de lys when my Cleo decides to eat zoidarks poison breath.",4
Very fun and addictive,5
Cool game,4
".5% Featured rates, yeah no. Funny they somehow made something even worse than Fire Emblem Heroes. Wish Nintendo didn't aim to include every toxic mobile design choice.",1
"It's great,but the frame rate is really bad and slow. also the slide to walk is not working that well and after the characters talk before the battle, it stays in the text for a long time. also I really love this game.",4
This game is,3
"This is absolutely one of the best cell phone based RPGs I've ever played. The stories can take up a bit of time, but the gameplay is easy and realistic. There's a lot to learn about upgrading, but once you get the hang of it it's worth it.",5
Standard genre tropes for a jrpg summoner game. Shame there's no black people. But why would black people exist in mythical worlds right?,4
"Nice graphics, with good gameplay.",5
Great game. Keeps you interested.,5
Great game,5
Dragons are cool in this game and it is awesome.,5
Far too much dialogue. The download sizes are massive which is unfortunate. Love the combat system.,3
Amazing!!,5
"It's a relatively simple RPG, with Gacha mechanics at it's core. Really not much else to say. Quite grindy, but I wouldn't say it reaches extreme levels and so far isnt pay to win in any way.",4
Great game!,5
Best game I've played in years,5
"Such an awesome action combat game. This gets my vote for best mobile game. I've played a ton, but they all last a week or so, at most the best have lasted a month, but this one has surpassed that. I recommend it. Has a great team working behind it attending to the community's feedback. This deserves a way higher score than the 3.9 that it currently has.",5
Awesome,5
"It's overall pretty funny and a good time consumer, it's only the first day and I can't stop playing it",5
Freaking love it beautiful graphics and gameplay,5
"It's a really good game, I look forward to continue playing",5
Awsome game and fun to play,5
Amazing,5
Good,5
It wont start,2
With the beutiful animation and stunning story as well as in depth gameplay this an enjoyable game on the go,5
Pretty great new Nintendo on mobile,5
It's real good and fun,5
Cool,5
This game is awesome,5
When i saw the slide show i thought it was an anime no cap,3
I FREAKIN' LOVE IT!,5
I love the game,5
It's a great game and I would like to continue but I can't get past title screen it says server error please fix,3
Amazing,5
I think it could save time by updateing all at once rather them 1once every few ep,2
Amazing game good job,5
Great game!!! Love the graphics and everything!!!,5
"Game is amazing and truly worth 5, but the character skills lack depth/diversity. Pretty much every single character in a weapon class is the same minus stat differences. The game need characters with unique skillsets/synergies to make the game more strategic. 2stars until this is addressed.",2
It keeps saying failed to extract resources from ll2cpp,1
I FREAKIN LOVE THIS GAME!!!,5
Have to download everything and it takes forever,1
Love this game. Great story. The best thing is they have dragons. The graphics are great. I was not expecting this from Nintendo. Contact me Nintendo I have a friend who wishes to help you achieve something great. Although i think ur company is going for extinction but she wants to work on VR stuff. I believe VR is the next way for gaming so start making vr mario styles.,5
Cool game,4
Awesoooomeee!,5
Issue with freezing when collecting mission rewards and when i reload the game awards are gone? Luckily its been early game awards but vary annoying,4
Good storyline. Also good characters.,5
Love the adventure thus far,5
It is a ok game,5
Overall its a great game but i really wish it was a sidescroller,5
It's a great mobile game. Easy to pick up and it doesn't take up too much time.,5
Great mobile rpg with no pressure to spend money,5
Great game,5
Awesome game. Just wish it didn't have a download every flipping stage,5
Visuals and gameplay are incredibly addictive.,5
It's visually pleasing paired with an amazing story structure.,5
Couldn't even play it because I can't get it to download on my galaxy tab,1
I'm loving it,5
I love it,5
It's very well polished. The gatcha system is a little strict but maybe it lessens up a bit further you get in. Decent game overall though.,4
"It's a really good game, but it takes up a lot of space. I had to delete the game to make room for other important applications.",4
Omg the best game I've played in a long time,5
I think its cool and i really like it😜,5
I would rate this app higher but I can't even get into the dang game it keeps giving me a error code 400 whatever that means im going to keep trying for another day or two then im just deleting it ill update this review in 2 days,1
Events are too short so you miss limited heroes. Only way to keep up is spend money. Bad play nintendo,2
Great,5
This game is great,5
"It's A Great Game for us. But there's slightly problem. I can't play because of Internet connection error, if you can fix in the next update.",5
Its good,5
great game,5
Cool awsome and amazing,5
It's really detailed and really good with the grafics I totally recommend it,5
Loved it. It was a game especially for me.,5
Crafting tree is pure garbage. It takes forever to get to the last tier in crafting 1 weapon.,1
Love it,5
Amazing,5
"Amazing story, graphics, and characters to play as",5
This game is awesome!,5
Ever since ive downloaded it i have not had a chance to play more than a minute and its not due to lack of free time... in game download after in game dl. Dl a 400 mb thing. Play a minute. Dl another 500 mb thing... too much downloading and not enough play,1
Fun,4
"It takes way too much memory. After the initial download, it required an extra 600 MB before I could even start playing. After the opening chapter, it demanded I download an extra 1 GB of data before continuing playing. Nope. Uninstalled after just 5 minutes. It's a pretty game, so this was pretty disappointing.",1
Addictive game to kill some time. So far no major issues or bugs yet but just started.,5
"Error 3002 constantly. Way too many ""disconnected from host"" issues. Makes the game unplayable.",1
"Amazing Game, Sometimes update wont load and screen will just show up as a black Pixel, But its still good!",5
"Everything is amazing in this game.Its got good story, characters, mechanics, and really great plot twists",5
Just so cool,5
Das is gut,5
Very different and fun,5
Solid mobile game.,4
"It's fun, creative and cute! Music is awesome",5
"Addictive, feels like a classic. Great mobile jrpg from Nintendo!",5
My favorite game!!!This is the best anime game ever,5
Too many data downloads.,3
Make a second one please,5
It's a great game with an awesome story and fantastic gameplay. One thing I think could be improved the the controls for when you try to fight an enemy.,4
Best game ever,5
T was the best game ever acept for pocket mortys,5
Awesome game so far,5
"Absolutely TERRIBLE moving mechanics, walking continuously doesn't work and will just throw off your path into a different angle. Could only play through half of the tutorial without getting yet ANOTHER update download screen. Spent a day just trying to download the game data whole and who knows how long it'll take for all the updates.",2
👌,5
Really cool game.,5
"Surprised at all the negativity. There are p2w aspects but it doesn't impact the game nearly as much as other cashgrab games I've encountered. Very grindy - similar to fate go in those respects. As a result it's satisfying to upgrade things. Controls are so-so, not the greatest but definitely not so bad it warrants all the hate here. Drop rates seem abysmal, probably my main complaint. Banners should feature more than one new 5* adventurer/dragon, feels like a huge waste to dump a ton into a banner for one new adventurer. Overall fun game though. I'll continue to play as long as I see the developer's continuing to address things as they have been. Attentive devs that listen to the community is what makes games like these thrive.",5
Wow it so good I have no word from it is,5
"I'm very addicted to the gameplay, graphics are fun, and it's just pure entertainment. Just onnnne little problem...can you please make a landscape version? Like allow me to play it as most phones are meant to be held while gaming? Plleeeeassee? Love ya forever lol Portrait version is killing me",5
"Good time killer so far, do enjoy the graphics",4
It is better than I thought it would be. Not turn based like others. Story is nice and characters are fun too.,5
"I enjoy the game's gameplay, music, art and the little comics they include. I'm enjoying the raid event. I'm biased though because I follow cydesignation and adore their artists. The gameplay is great and I enjoy the raid mechanics so far. For anyone starting out, I recommend gamepress's guides for some tips. I leaned a lot from using more resources than I'd like but I'm not that bummed about it that I'd start all over. Play the game and have fun",5
Great game,5
It is awesome,5
So far so good. Fun and pretty easy to get the hang of although I am sure the strategy will kick in soon,5
OMG ITS SO SO so. not that great takes so long to download a file just to download another so bad game,1
Teri Bale lol its really good,3
Its dope,5
I think this game deserves a gold award winning medal and love!!!!!!!😎😎😊😀☺️🙂🤗,5
The best game ever made in this world,5
"I believe the game has the best gameplay, controls, and gets to let u and let's u have a choice of your graphic. This game just out did itself. One of the best mobile games I've ever played",5
Amazing Awsome Best ever Cool,5
Its in all a pretty fun game and gets decent views on youtube!,4
"I lve the game overall, but I'm having an issue here. Recently I upgraded my smartphone and for some reason it doesn't let me go in co-op, but I can play the game in solo the problem is only in co-op tha a message of error 13 keeps pooping up, and hence I havent been able to finish the event nor play with my friends. I hope you guys help me out on this, because It wasn't doing that... No until I upgraded my phone.",5
Game is good but is brought down by continuous downloads for everything...i spend more time downloading mission then i spend playing.,1
I've enjoyed every second I've played this game. It's fun and very easy to pick up. Hard to put down. I can't wait to see what else this game has to offer!,5
Great game. Feels like Secret of Mana. Love the way the controls work. Story is captivating so far. Hoping the micro transactions aren't ridiculous. Haven't progressed enough to know for sure,5
Pretty cool,5
Good game,5
Very well made very fun an interactive....only thing I've noticed is a few spelling an grammatical errors in chat lol. Not very far into it but its grabbed my attention.,5
"Controls are the only thing that needs work, and you can learn to cope with them. Primarily Moving and attacking: -If you drag your finger too fast from one swipe while moving, it causes a sharp turn instead, which breaks momentum. -You also dont attack enemies you tap, just the ones you're facing, which is annoying. Other than that, the game is an absolute blast. Highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a good Mobile Action RPG Experience",5
"Good game, smooth controls, BUT! It's huge! And it continuously needs downloads. I'm going to have to delete it because it's getting ridiculous. :(",3
Amazing graphics and story line with amazing sound effects,5
MMMMHMMMHHHMMMM.......Anime😎,5
Sulute,5
Can get slow but it keeps you busy and has a great story,4
I love this top number one 🎮 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
Fun fun fun,5
"This is a really fun and cute again, the controls are a bit anoying",5
pretty good!👌,5
So far I love the game no complaints so far the only thing is the movement control needs some fixing. I go move straight then the character will all of a sudden go another direction sometime.,5
Cute fun little game. :),5
So far so good. Will update later if anything changes,5
I love this game on iOS but android I have been experiencing a problem with your game it can't connect to the server,3
Cool,5
Just try it its best if you see if you like it yourself for me I like it,5
GG,5
Solid,5
Cute and fun,5
It so fun,5
Sure its a gatcha game but the story is great!,5
It's a great rpg. The are just a lot of down loads,5
Best lil game i've found so far. Keep up the good work I'm hooked I'm a fan!,5
Really nice game,5
"Fun game, take a kot of data though",5
Good stuff,5
This game is awesome!!!!!!!!,5
"Cygames does it again! This time with an ARPG. What I love about this game are the limited events they release around every 2 weeks (maybe less). These aren't your time to spend money or else I don't get anything from this event, but rather actual content with fully voice acted scenes and challenging boss fights. I do recommend this game to everybody, but we need to talk about some issues in the game. Now I know the rates are low but I actually like it. It makes 5* pulls actually rare, unlike in other games where you easily get copies of Super Super Rare characters. Sure it's disappointing not having all the 5* champs, but that's what makes the ones I have so special. Also many 4* characters are viable so really it's not a big deal. One issue I have with the game is the controls. I'm a little used to it now but I still find it irritating in specific occasions. Like how when you try to move a tiny step it causes you to dodge. Here's a tip: try disabling the quick 90 and 180 degree quick turn feature if the controls feel wonky to you. The last issue i need to state is lack of content. True the game is new and yes it is adding new content at an incredible rate, but when compared to other gacha games, there is still currently not much to do. But knowing Cygames and their great reputation of free, entertaining, substantial content, I'm looking forward to seeing this game grow.",5
Don't know why this game isn't rated higher. Incredibly polished mobile RPG with actual good gameplay. Leaps and bounds ahead of the mobile gaming market. High quality game in every aspect. Much respect for the effort put into this game. This is the only mobile game I've ever bothered reviewing because it deserves it and I regret avoiding it for a month due to low ratings.,5
Great game its a little glitchy and has shut down randomly a few times. Nice to see something from Nintendo on Android os.,4
No,5
"I like the game, but how many time that game have to Download to process every time again and again. I am tired wait long time process download is make me boring waiting.",1
Great game but would be nice if it didn't take so much storage every time I get to another level I mean our phones all ready take enough storage just to update a app eventually leading to buy another phone but I'm sure everyone already knows that.,4
"Another wrong move by Cygames again. Game itself is good, Story is pretty okay but it too grindy.",3
It's been good so far hope it stays good,4
Noah,5
"Perfect RPG. A team with interchangeable, upgradeable items. Multiple characters woth multiple abilities. Controls are amazing because you can start where you want, its recommended to start on the bottom so you can see, and move in any direction. Play graphics are amazing and story art is better.",5
"For casual playing, you need to accept you will be discriminated by the game For intensive playing, you will find that you need to play more intensive....",3
"Playing it for a while so far I like what I see the characters are great, story is interesting, and the comic strips are adorable. It is a pretty good game",5
Yes,5
Pretty good,4
Simple and fun.,5
Great game. Love the Co-op!,5
Nice game,5
Great game Just what I've been looking for. I recommend for anyone that played Nintendo games growing up.,5
T h i c c a n i m e b a b e s,5
Yup,5
Awesome app,5
"Takes up much space(1-2GB when attempting to download EVERYTHING for Dragalia Lost), gameplay is simple enough to need only one finger, graphics are decent but I had to switch to an emulator for smoother gameplay.",5
I cannot see the characters. The actual characters are completely blacksmith no details.,3
Voice acting and animation is on point. I wish there was more 2d animated parts though. Otherwise the game is really fun.,5
My bro is obsessed with this game. Waiting in patiently for my game to work so I can play with him Xd great game!,5
Amazingly addictive game. Never played a mobile game like this before and I'm glad I tried it!,5
So fun,5
I love the graphics and the controls are as smooth as butter,5
Best MOBILE GAME EVER!!! Thank you Nintendo!!!,5
Stop sending me ads its,1
It's very adectibg,5
Nintendo..... I never thought you'd top pokemon.... thank you...-Shaun aka a Nintendo fan since birth I appreciate you highly,5
good... I enjoyed the story.. and the characters are awesome,5
Gg Nintendo and partners,5
I love it ! It's really good and amazing! 😁🏹,5
So much anime detail it's awesome especially the voice acting story and controls I'd kill for this game and let's not for get the karaoke music,5
TAKES LONG TIME FOR LOADING TO FINISH....But it's a good game,4
If your stupid ads were a actual depiction of the gameplay animated then I'd be interested. Stop falsifying your advertisements,1
"The game has criminally low 5 star rates, and the game will bury you with 5 star buff cards that are put into the gambling pool strictly to dilute your chances of getting what you want. Good gameplay though, with a responsive developer team.",2
The game play is fun and the story is interesting.However the text scrolls really slow,4
"Its another one of Nintendo's successes out of all of their successes and I encourage you to make another dragalia. If you want my segesston, it should be called ""dragalia world""",4
It's ight,5
Powerful,5
It is incredible and should be played by many more people.,5
The graphics and the game play of the levels are great. I find the controls kind of weird since you have to stop moving before you attack.,4
So far I love this game the controls are smooth the graphics are amazing and the story is fantastic pre register for this game because I knew it was going to be amazing,5
Download another 600megs to play! 😡,1
It's pretty good its F2P friendly,4
It was cool,3
It won't even load,3
"The movement mechanics are very choppy. Having a better, joystick type circle like some games do would greatly improve it.",4
Amazing and addicting,5
Is there an anime of this I'm asking cause I say a few adds that had clips that looked like there from an anime.,4
"Dragalia Lost is an amazing game that you should play! The game mechanics are simple to use, and easy to memorize. There's so much to do, like quests and events! And you can play with others players in missions. This game DESERVES 5 stars!",5
"Great game, easy to play, addicting, and fairly new to most.",5
It's good. That is all,5
One of the better games on the app store so far,5
It won't let me even play fix it,1
Its ok,4
"Can't give it more then a one star. Installed the game only for it to tell me I need to update, but there's no update available. Tried reinstalling multiple times but there is still no option.",1
Really enjoy the game hope to see more,5
Its awesome,5
A little power and memory hungry but good so far,4
well it keep telling me to update when i cant find the update buttin...,1
I like the story of the game,5
Awesome game!!,5
It's cool,5
Awesome,5
It has a lot of storyline and reasons for everything that happens,5
"Good story, nice graphics, smooth gameplay",5
Great game fun to play. Great time killer. Haven't had any problems with game yet like some of the low comments.,5
Game is super fun but the gacha is awful and mostly unrewarding.,4
Its an amazing game about collecting,5
Good game,5
Great story and great visuals.,5
"I think this game is great, but I just have a glitch where I go to gifts to give to dragons and it just shows bread rolls where four leaf clovers should be and the numbers 123 on the bottom.",4
I love it its addictive,5
"Nice graphics fun game, but it sucks to have to constantly download everything, every mission, takes forever",4
This game crashes most times I try to open it. When it does open it tries to download additional files. This download always fails with a network error.,1
its good i like it.,5
Get ready for loading screen simulator 2018.....,1
Device not authorized to play this game?,1
"Dispute some bugs, game quality is triple A",4
It's great,5
Great game,5
This is decent for the genre. Easy to play and control,5
Way too many downloads...,1
"Great game, only problem I have with it is the download time at the beginning and for the batch download, other than that, it's a solid 8/10",4
Needs more old buff bearded dudes,3
"Wish there was a way to just use an analog stick to walk around, but other then that it's a fantastic game can't believe it's free",4
I love the dragons in this game,5
"A run-of-the-mill RPG but I like it that way. As expected of Nintendo, everything from the graphics to the music has been carefully formulated for never ending entertainment. I say this is a great first step for anyone who wants to enter the huge world of RPG's. My only advice is to turn off the 180 and 90 degree turn since it gets annoying when trying to maneuver.",5
Love it,5
I need more space,5
I am truly enjoying this game! It is totally awesome sauce!!,5
Having lots of fun story is interesting,5
its awesome,5
"I'm thoroughly enjoying this game. Wish I would have picked it up on launch. Combat is fun. Art is amazing. Graphics are great. I think the dialog is better in Japanese, but that's just my preference. It can feel a little repetitive at times but for this type of game I'm ok with that. The cost for 10x pulls is more than fair when compared to other games. I haven't spent any real money on this game and got close to 10k in-game currency in just a few days. TL:DR Great game with a great story. Def worth the download.",5
I just love the game.,5
It's fun but character control isn't too good. I'd like to see the addition of a joystick pad to make movement easier.,4
"Meh, the game brings nothing new to a crowded genre. It's beautiful, but wasn't engaging enough to keep playing.",3
Interesting game definitely fun and well polished for me,4
Great game a lot to do,5
A refreshing mobile action rpg with a lot fairly tale cartoon charm,5
It's a fun little game. Not for everyone for sure. But I suggest you at least give it a shot. Might surprise you like it did me :V,5
It's Kool,5
The best game ever The best game ever is this game Dod af dood,5
The graphics for the game is just beautiful never seen better in my life.,5
Its interesting,5
"The combat is be fun and engaging, but has some issues with its controls. This becomes evident when you start using force strikes. I would say this only works half the time. Sometimes movement can be slightly jerky also. The gacha pull rates for this game is simply atrocious. They have to implement a pity system for some reason, instead of you know, making the rates acceptable. However, the characters are great. Fairly diverse and colorful bunch of characters makes the experience better. The story is serviceable, abiet mostly generic. I would say the best part of the game is the co-op. Co-op for the trials and raids is a ton of fun. If this game didn't have co-op, I would not play this game at all.",2
To much to download,3
It's a great game,5
More depth than I thought an app game could be,5
The game will only use my cell service. Won't recognize my Wi-Fi and requires constant downloads.,2
Stuck in update loop. Can't even play it Edit they fixed the issue. It's pretty good now. Music is my jam,4
Super cool,5
"Is is good. Graphics are great, story is awsome, movement is okay, voice actors are phenomenal",4
Great story line,5
It won't download data,1
This game is amazing great music it does repeat alot but its so good you can listen to it for hours and I love that there is a good story to the game not like other games just puting you against enemies and not knowing why overall great game,5
Very good rpg game that's f2p friendly. Don't need newest units to progress.,5
"Download after download, I gave up",1
Amazing,5
I think its great because its got such great plot and good graphics,5
"Just downloaded and trying to play but it's saying it needs an update. I just downloaded the most recent file, how does it need an update!? Will not go past title screen. Uninstalling.",1
Fun interactive gameplay! Quick and easy to learn,5
"Deleted it because it kept asking me to download something to keep playing, not worth my storage space",4
Good game,5
Love it,5
"For a mobile game the graphics though, a little bit old are very pretty and colorful. Also, I haven't even started the story and I've already fallen in love with the characters and the gameplay.",5
Best mobile game ive played in awhile,5
The story line and sub storys,5
I love the content,5
"Well my tablet broke not sure if it was because of the game or because the game was lucky enough to be the app that my tablet broke during. Had my tablet for around 9 months, just finally got a replacement tablet to update review. Gonna keep my review at the current star rating because of the bad experience and I don't feel like trying the game again but thought I should update my review.",1
Good,5
"The game is fun my only problem is for someone who has already gotten all wyrmite from co_op and story, there is no other way to get this currency besides the daily missions which only give 50 thats FAR to little! Which is very bad since wyrmite is needed for summons and your castle It should be 200-300 from daily missions!!!!!",4
It's so litty,5
Gameplay is fun but the worst summon rates in recent memory bring the experience way down.,3
"Nice gameplay and some funny stories along the way however, after innumerable updates, it's about to outgrow my device.",4
Overall a really good game but it has too many downloads and the menus are a little confusing. It is a very fun game for sure though minus those 2 things.,4
Great graphics and amazing storytelling i would like to play a second version of this game,5
Neat,4
"It's okay don't get me wrong but,I think I'll just stick to FE Heros",3
"Simple to pick up. Easy controls with subtlety. Lots of places to go, but chapters that are short enough you can do a few and move on, or keep playing for hours. Very good.",5
Really great game love it Its so cute,5
"Runs and plays very well, but I don't like how much downloading is required for each level",4
"The materials required for a 10x summon aren't hard to collect, you can get them everyday in small quantities, but there are a bunch of quest to get them",5
Dragons,5
"Soundtrack is very catchy it's by Daoko look her up and support her. Gameplay in this gsme is easy to play has fun dodge mechanics and rpg elements, people rating this game low soely because this game has ""gambling"" are dumb. It's expected for all mobile games cause how does hardwork get paid. This game is free and doesn't ask you for money the option is there at your convience. Life does not come free buddies. Anyway the story and lore of this game is a fun and entetaining.",5
Seems ok so far,4
Cool game.,5
Will to start its grate u can create ur own name even change it make ur own team pr use the optamized for the best results and its fun too....tho ran in to a problem sofar its during the campaign theres this glitch tht kickes u off the map sometimes u r still on the area but no monsters and all u can do is run around in a circle and u have to abandon the mission or getvl out of the game to fix it happened to me often on campian missions,5
Cool.,5
Well done,4
This app is amazing! It has a great company that listens to its community and fixes a lot of things that people want in the game. Download this game its amazing!,5
Fun game and addicting,5
I like it,5
Good Stuff,5
All my yes belong to this.,5
First off don't take too much stock in the bad reviews. Biggest complaint is their not getting high lvl characters easy..and they have to work for their progress. I find the drop rate is fine. The game is a touch bit on the grindy side but the story element if you actually follow it can help break up alot of that. Also events have been alot of fun although it would be good to have more styles of gameplay. This game is very new and it's obvious that this game will grow and improve. I never have trouble grouping in co-op unlike alot of other games. The only major complaints I have is the weapon system is way to involved and you have to make the same weapon way to many times to get a third tier weapon. also I dont like that smithy cannot be leveled up to lvl 4 which is needed for 3 star weapons untill main castle area has had 100 facilites upgraded. which is a major amount of work for your base 3 star weapons. But all in all it's a very addictive and fun game and you can switch between characters and skills which is great. also the dragons are alot of fun to use. definitely worth playing and I'd suggest playing untill you unlock castle area to give it a chance to unlock most features before deciding if you will continue. by that point I was hooked.,4
I like the concept but the space it needs is so stupid,1
The game is fun and the devs really listen and communicate with the community but the draw rates are TERRIBLE. Saving up to do 6 10 summons not to get any 5 star units or prints really kills the enjoyment of the game. Ive tried to have hope for this but this is one of the most unsatisfying games ive encountered.,1
very fun gatcha game. I havent made too far yet but from what i can tell the game seems to be very polished and seems to have weekly updates for content.,5
This game is amazing!,5
"Took a star away from my beloved Nintendo, whom I happily throw money at on the daily, because even though the game has an awesome story, easy to play interface and beautiful graphics, this game is unnecessarily GIGANTIC of a download. Its much appreciated that you can switch from the cute chibi 3d models to the beautifully done 2d artwork, but it still feels like a disadvantage because I'm missing out on a lot of content this way.",4
I'll give it a 5 star once it gives me my favorite Dragon Agni and less wyrmprints.,4
Freezes without fail when creating a room for an event. The most infuriating thing is that I cant ignore the introduction to enjoy the other features.,4
Great game. Newest update wouldnt download. Had to uninstall and reinstall the entire game. I lost all my dragons and some very good summons and all my paid gems. Ill try again to enter my account but not happy right now.,2
Controls are wonky and can't see the action past my finger.,3
"Poor summonning chance, inaccurate and unfair",1
Great game and the graphics is awesome but I have to do a ton of this downloading stuff and I don't wanna waste my time just downloading than actually playing the game. So if you guys can fix this up a lil bit that'll be great!,3
I really like this game but don't have service everywhere needs offline mode,3
Good game,5
For a phone application has a great story and has me awaiting what's next!,5
Good gacha game to FTP,5
Great but the coop tutorial wont go away and the whole mode wont work for me.:/,5
Good,3
"Awesome game, loads of fun, with a great story and beautiful graphics.",5
"I like it. It's a decent action rpg. See alot of complaints about grinding, however hand not had to grind anymore than any other game of this type. After about 2-3 hours of play I was able to get enough in game currency to play the premium x10 draw at least 4 times. And I got some good stuff out of it. Not bad just starting out. Make your own judgments, but this is a game that is not going to just hand you everything. Overall, it's an entertaining game",4
"A free to play action rpg that doesnt make you feel like you need to pay 2 win. Great events, cool crafting and character progression..it even has lore",5
"Fun, action based gameplay. The devs are responsive to feedback and events are frequent. We've also gotten quite a few free summon pulls already. Highly recommend at this time!",5
It's badass,5
This game is fun but its always asking to download stuff it should do that from the start,5
I love the game play it almost reminds me of the 7 deadly sins except with dragons.,5
Best game ever,5
music so good,4
"Enjoying the game alot, could use some form of guilds tho",5
Other gacha games need to take notes. The devs are the best. They actively listen to the community and fix problems. The game is inherently fun and HAS ONE OF THE BEST SOUND TRACKS. like music is so good. Oml. 11/10.,5
Very nice Nintendo release,4
It is a fun game to play and it a nice game to play all day and at night,5
It's a great game,5
The sound track just screams ur gonna have a good time with it just as I expected from an Nintendo game with cygames,5
Game wont even update.,1
Geese,5
Fun good animation but it lags alot on the home screen of the game,4
This game is great so far. Love it!,5
"Love It, Short stories to understand a character's background, Co-op is fun and acticlve, Always new bug fixes and Events! 😀",5
Very fun and addictive game,4
"Game is really good. Clear plot and story line, along with graphics and gameplay. Really good game, but takes up quite the amount of storage.",5
"Great Mobile RPG. Gameplay is easy but, in my opinion, a little expensive to have all the fun. Money is not needed but like all games like this cash makes the world spin faster.",4
It's a fun story based game I'm not going to get into details but basically it's about a prince and his sister and fairy going on a quest it's fun and I recommend it,5
I wish it was made into an anime,5
I love this game i just wish there werent any DAMN TIME TRIALS,5
Keeps telling me to update the game and won't let me play,1
"Simple game play, interesting characters, original concept, well written story. A must for Nintendo and RPG lovers",5
"Great game so far, a lot of updates. Definitely want to have a wifi connection to download, play, and update. All in all I think this game is well worth giving a shot, if you're a fan of action RPGs.",4
Best game,5
Yay!,5
It is a awsone game there should be more games like it,5
Marbelle gang,5
Amazing,5
No,1
Great waifu gacha rpg game.,5
Such a cute and fun game!!,5
Nintendo dinosaur,5
"Great game But I cannot get the new update for some reason, I have enough space, but it won't work, however great game",5
Cool,5
Fantastic game from a very active development team!,5
"Love the graphics, its different but i like it",5
Great game fun to play kills time when bored good back ground music my kid dances when it comes on,5
The gameplay is really fun but the rates for 5* adventurers is really low.,5
"Great,fun,addictive",5
"Graphics are excellent, gameplay is pretty deep despite the simple inputs. The story and characters are charming and occasionally well written. I don't really like all the grinding, but that also means there's a lot to do. But, the standout thing is the quality of communication and iteration we're seeing out of Dragalia. So far they've added Options that improve controls, quality of life improvements (hold to jump the the castle, auto picks up chests) and ""fair"" rebalancing (when they changed crest rewards & gatherwing refresh mechanics, they sent out compensation equal to the amount that the user would have gotten). Overall pretty stellar.",5
This is the best Rpg type game!😍,5
VERY VERY NICE.,5
I love this game so addicting,5
Love this game,5
Fun little time sink. Tickles the action rpg bone.,5
I love dragon lost,5
I would give it a 5 but I still can't play online. I get stuck waiting for more than 2 minutes and just close the app.,4
Fun game,5
"Fun and cute, just like my non existent girl friend",5
"That music is amazing. And the game itself, while not super innovative, is refined and polished, without throwing too much in your face.",5
"Seemed good, seems like it will only improve with time.",5
This game is awesome! I hope to see it come to the switch someday!,5
Honestly the best mobile game I've ever played. Feedback is heard and worked on rather than ignored and the developer is more than generous when making sure the player is treated right.,5
"Gameplay is alright, and the gacha system is surprisingly well made. So I'll keep playing.",4
Love it make a number 2 of it,5
Legit af,5
"Great graphics and story, but constant downloads of 1 Gb and of data are annoying. I installed yesterday, since then had to download 900+ Mb of data twice. Impossible to play while in commute, you need good high speed internet connection because of that.",3
"Devs are very responsive to community feedback, very generous as well. In terms of gacha games this is a win win",5
Bite size top down hack n slash. Awesome.,5
"Let me update this. It's been more than a month since the game has released. And within that month, we've had two events, several updates, and Cygames listening to their customers. We have had improvements on the controls, to co-op environment. And every update has given us another a Tenfold summon. Wonderful game and a wonderful developer",5
I dunno what to say.... let's see it's fun and easy 2 understand i guess 4 does who have bad internet connection or upload speeds is gonna make the game frame drop like hell (happens 2 me alot) but nonetheless worth it to try ;3,5
Cygames (the developer for this game) consistently listens to players and implements fixes for game design (mostly surrounding the getherwing stamina system) and control issues (notably the force strike attacks). There's a surprising amount of depth in here for a mobile ARPG.,5
Honestly the best phone game I've ever played!,5
"This games artwork is some of the best I've seen I games, the music is really epic too. Gameplay is fun and never gets boring. Keep it up Nintendo!",5
"It's a fantastic and charming game with a great story. The characters are as varied as a Fire Emblem game, and there is a lot to do and plenty of energy/stamina to do it with. My gripe is with your AI teammates and the amount of Drops you need to make a character five star. I know it's to make five stars more special and make you buy currency for draws, but it just feels too grindy. If we could adjust the exp levels of upgrade materials, that'd be nice too. It feels like you can only invest in a few select characters without underpowering your teams. Unless you play this game religiously of course.",4
More dragons,5
Just installed the game and it keeps saying that it needs to update but it's already updated. Please fix and I will change my rating.,2
Multiplayer for the most part has been fixed! Play your heart out!,3
Fantastically Fanatical Fantasy Funfair!,5
Good little time waste,5
The ad breaks my games,1
"Lovely, just lovely",5
"Other than a little small annoyances with the controls and upgrading buildings. Awesome game, even on mobile, Nintendo nails their games.",5
"It's good, yo!",4
Everything but the gacha rate is perfect for this game.,5
I love this game now so much fun,5
Most ambitious title on the phone to date. Could easily be incorporated into a Switch title like with the new Pokemon games.,5
Best,5
I'm still very early in the game but am enjoying the gameplay so far and the story is engaging. Controls are about what you would expect. The game looks great.,5
Love it,5
"Great controls, great story, and its free!!! What's not to love! Thanks again Nin",5
"Didn't even get to play, says it requires an update and redirects to the play store without an update.",1
I really like this game.,5
Amazing game great graphics but the game play is a lil touchy and not easy to control all the time,4
Yes,5
It's a great game altogether but the intro is annoying.,5
Love it this is a great game,5
I love it!!,5
Hope they add switch support and controller support,5
"The game itself runs really well and has such great graphics, its super fun and enjoyable, I don't like the controls though, maybe if it was a joystick button and attack button instead of having to drag it.",5
"I became basically instantly addicted to this game. The pacing is really nice, the art and writing are great, and i love that you can basically spend however much time as you want on it, though it's an easy time sink, fair warning you might lose a few hours to it",5
"Fun li'l gacha game, enjoying f2p since release.",5
Super cute and thank you for the comic so I could learn about the characters please keep working hard.,5
"good stuff, devs listen, fun game",5
🔥🔥🔥,5
"I'm loving this game! Tons of content, great story, and lovable characters!",5
"I really don't understand the reason for so many low reviews. The gameplay seems novel (at least to me), and the gacha rates, though low, are up front about it. Once you get a 5* unit, you're done - no additional gacha needed for them to be serviceable. Compare this to Fire Emblem Heroes (FEH), which appears generous on the surface, but actually is quite insidious in its execution: you need gacha for getting a particular unit, then gacha for 10 more copies of that unit, then gacha for good IVs, then gacha for good skills to give them... It adds up. In this, 3* and 4* units can arguably be just as serviceable as 5* units, which the same cannot be said of FEH. The devs listen to feedback, and they are transparent about bugs and issues. Communication is key to maintaining a good relationship with your customers, and so far Cygames is doing a great job of it. So far I have had no complaints about the game, and I look forward to seeing what the devs have in store for the future!",5
"The controls are a little weird to me, but over all great.",4
I love this game and reminds me of Nintendo is very good except for one thing it always keeps asking about downloading even wanted to each level maybe you guys just need to Auto load the set of keep asking to download the other that is games is amazing and the graphics are awesome,4
Awesome game well set up,5
Weeb trash,1
Takes up more of my time than I care to admit. Amazing game,5
Love it wish they had it for switch,5
"The game itself is well designed. Easily one of the best on the market as of writing this review. Despite the nature of gacha, there is meaningful gameplay not gated by micro-transactions. Until many days-weeks later, there is essentially no indication of artificial time gating, and by then the ""end game"" grind is well underway. A person not interested in spending excess money need no be concerned with needing to pay to play. The touch controls are a bit clumsy sometimes, but that's the fault of hardwar, not this software. My only major criticism is the ever ballooning app size. I've needed to delete other apps consistently every time the game needs to update. This final time, I simply don't have any room to spare, so the game must go. Consider adding a ""lite"" version.",4
Gacha and fun,5
Awesome game,5
Great game!!! I love it!!!,4
The music is really good,5
Fun game and fixes are constant .Great work.,5
I'm blue,5
Cool!!!,5
"This game is an incredibly fun game. Not pay-to-win, free to play, and very intricate in a good way",5
Pretty well done Gotcha Game a lot of work was out into it and the music is Darn Catchy I enjoy playing in the mornings,4
So addictive the game is fun it is about dragons and you get to become them there is allot of action in this game but it is very fun so if you have time to play you should try this game.,5
"Was fun while it lasted, but the summon rates are horrific. Even worse than some other games of this genre I play. Trying to get new heroes is a pain. The past 10 rainbow pulls I've gotten were wyrmprints and I'm tired of seeing that. At least seperate the pulls somehow. Gameplay was good and music is amazing. Too bad the gatcha is too ridiculous and ruined the game for me. Thanks Nintendo",2
Great attempt by Nintendo/Cygames to make a co-op gacha game. Love it so far and it seems to only be getting improved,5
I really enjoy this game. Great time killer. Fun cliche story with classic trope characters. Gameplay is great imo. Summon rates are awful good luck getting what you want without whaling but as a F2P I'm doing excellent doesn't require a cent to enjoy.,5
"Amazing game! Loving the graphics and art the style. The characters are cute and cool, the action oriented gameplay is really fun. Rates arent too bad and collecting the free currency is no trouble at all and there is alot to get. Definetly worth a try!",5
Would best the best rpg's on mobile if chat and guilds were added. Other than that no complaints.,5
Good game no thing else but a very awesome game,5
Realy nice job,5
Controls kinda werid,5
"Really amazing Hero Collector game! One of the better gacha games out there and that i have played. Alqays something to do, such as building and leveling up your castle and halidom, grinding up characters and their mana circles. An amazing game! Good job!",5
Pretty dope game I enjoy it,5
Great and addictive,5
I think this game is the most awesome mobile game I have ever played!,5
I think there can be a rework on some of the movement controls but everything else is amazing about the game! I love playing it 24/7!,5
Surprisingly fun game,5
Totally fun a great rpg combined with mobe styles!,5
"Fun gameplay, nice story, interesting characters, awesome music, lots of content, very generous, praise Cygames",5
Very hard to get chase items and heroes,3
Very fun,4
Very fun and interactive and it's getting constant add ons and there is always something new to do,5
"Absolutely amazing story Nintendo outdone themselves, and love the graphics to.",5
Fun game,4
I love the game the only issue I have with this game is the fact that to do anything requires a download which is space consuming I feel like all of the levels should be able to be played without having to download the data for it since I have already downloaded the game,4
Amazing songs and and addicting gameplay,5
"Simple interaction game with a bit of sensitive controls that make it some what difficult to preform easy dodge action, and the constant downloads that has is a bit annoying. Otherwise this game is ok good",4
Its pretty and fun. Good job.,5
A fun game with a great story. Each character and dragon has their own story too! It took until level 40 before I would have to wait on stamina since it rolls over every time you level up. There are plenty of events so it is hard to get bored with it. All in all it is a great game.,5
Pointless to download. Figured I would try it out but it required a 700mb download before I can play. Sorry but if your game requires it to be downloaded after you install the app your wasting time it could of been downloaded to begin with.,1
Pretty good game,5
Love it 😍,5
Amazing game,5
"Had some bugs and problems on the start but the devs have been on top of it making the the correct tweaks to make the game a lot better. Still got a few issues but if the community brings it up enough, it'll get fixed in the coming updates.",5
such an amazing game I'm completely hooked and I just love the 7th prince his smile must be protected,5
It's fun,5
"Would get a better review, but the game has a ludicrous amount of bugs. I attack nearly every time I move for no reason. Ass on the fact that the game requires taking up so much space itself, then more and more space the longer you play it, to the point of needing to delete other apps, it's just silly. It's a mildly okay game, but there's more negative than positive by a long shot.",2
Love this game,5
Great game thanks,5
"I think most people who found this boring/dull/repetitive have never really played a gacha game, or are just Nintendo fans expecting a game like Pokemon Go and other games. With how much they're being called out, I'm not surprised that a majority of people don't know that Nintendo's only role in this was the distribution; the entire game itself is largely by Cygames. Yes, the company behind the notorious Granblue (Grindblue) Fantasy. If people are already complaining about the grind and abysmal gacha rates here...oh boy. Granted, GBF's rates are slightly better, but everything else is more or less the same. p.s No gacha will ever have worse rates than FGO (changemymind.jpeg)",5
"In the beginning the game had some issues with chapters not loading properly but everything seems to be fixed and the game is amazingly fun, and I highly recommend playing this game.",5
Great Game Support their always very open for feedback and are improving upon it making the game very enjoyable keep up the good work.,5
"A gacha mobile game that requires competency to be played successfully, and can be entirely played f2p. Looking forward to where it goes in the future.",5
Awesome,5
It's not downloading it just says that it's installing,1
This game is a treasure. It's very rare to see a game that offers great humor and story all at the free price of admission. This is already a game I praise above all mobile games I've ever played,5
Game's a great starting point if you don't wanna commit to Gachas. Very generous game.,5
"Best bois and grlgls may i have your attention, i have had a revolution within my head of the following. windwyrm IS ARCEUS !!!",5
"A truly great game. For a Gacha game, it does not force you to spend a dime. The writing is well done, and nothing but props to the translators and localizers. Bravo.",5
"Really awesome game! There's still some improvements that need to be made, but the developers have been great about listening to feedback and getting quick responses! Please keep up the great work",5

"Dragalia Lost is a great action RPG gatcha with a lot of polish. It combines multiple popular mobile gameplay elements into a single experience, generating loads of content that keeps on giving. Characters are highly developed, each with their own unique stories, attributes, and models. It's not hard to find characters to get attached to. The currency required to summon units is very generously given without need for IAPs. However, if you do decide to use IAPs on summons, the cost is quite high and there's no guarantee it will get you much further than anyone else. I think this higher paywall adds to the game's fairness, from a p2w standpoint. My advice to the developers is to continue to focus more on the game's biggest asset; the characters. I'd like to see more complex and personalizeable potential for teams synergies. I'd also like to see more attention put into making sure that more characters are viable, so that players don't have to pick away from their favorites.",5
"A pretty good game. The constant downloads are horrid, so definitely do the batch download in Options. Would have liked something more linear and less gatcha, but oh well. Touch controls are pretty squicky on my LG V30. Also, the English voices are awful.",4
One of the best development team's I've ever come across. They listen to the community and provide fixes to the game regularly. The gameplay is smooth and the story is fantastic. Definitely give this game a shot!,5
Fun and addicting,5
I like it and it's addicting,5
Love this game,5
So far so good,5
"As a free-to-player, all it took was a few rerolls to get a decent pull. Very indepth gameplay with a lot to do and achieve!",5
It has a great concept and the story is great. The music is just FABUULOUS! Like where can I buy the soundtrack?,5
"Thnx nintendo , best android game played ever , with grat story line",5
"Pretty fun, phone could only handle low graphics, though.",4
Pretty good game play with decent amount of characters,4
"Could really use a nonmoving control stick instead of using your fingers. Other then that, it's really enjoyable in small doses. Main protagonist reminds me of Shulk by the looks and Personality.",4
Good game so far...Ai need to be alot better,3
Great game. Horrible Movement and Poor connection party members who drop mid coop.,3
Great game. Hard to get wrymrite after awhile but fun.,5
"Solid mechanics, great art and music, extremely generous devs, f2p friendly and actually fun to play. Already a solid game at launch with lots of room to grow.",5
Its my second favorite mobile game,5
Cute fun little game.,5
"I can't get the game to finish downloading, it's hitting an error at 99% download, I've tried reinstalling but to no avail. No idea what the problem is, I'm on a Samsung galaxy S8, hopefully this can get resolved and I can try this and edit this review",1
It's a amazing game love how it's a classic like game drag along style gives great unique gameplay,5
Loved it's cool story and characters,5
Amazing game!!,5
"A very well made game. Only problem is every new level and update usually require a download, so it is very storage heavy.",4
"Quite good so far, but I wish they separate the gacha for wyrmprints and adventure/dragons",4
"If you have a lot of free time, it's a good game to pickup if you like mobile action-rpg.",5
i Like it its Okay?,3
"Solid game, high graphics requirements, plays great",5
"A wonderfully good time, great multiplayer fun and so cute! The OST is amazing!!",5
Amazing,5
Awesome story! Balanced reward system!,5
"Game can be a bit frustrating because the AI is pretty derpy. This might get fixed, and in general it's not too bad. Game is interesting and grindy but pretty good with friends. The game does lack a good way to party grind for a long game session without burning a lot of stamina and getherwing replenishment items.",5
"Dragalia Lost is an amazingly polished title. Regardless of its nature as a gacha mobile game, quality bleeds from every detail in this joint endeavor from Cygames and Nintendo. The gameplay is fluid and responsive in spite of its simplistic swipes and taps, allowing players' characters to dart about the screen and combo enemies with minimal difficulty - though Dragalia does become challenging during late game content, of course. Thankfully, Co-op support for up to 4 players is available for nearly every single stage in the game, and is easily more enjoyable than battling alongside an AI party of adventurers. It should be mentioned that you CAN turn into a dragon in this game, which then gets multiplied into 4 giant element-spewing beasts when playing Co-op. That's always a blast. Admittedly, while the gameplay is strong, the thing that hooked me *immediately* is the soundtrack. Performed by HAOKO, the first impression from Dragalia's OST is unabated energetic happiness. Several tracks have me bobbing my head along to them, and humming them even while not playing. They're THAT enjoyable. Make no mistake, there are restrained and foreboding pieces in the game as well, and they play during the appropriate moments of the Campaign. To be fair, as can be expected of a gacha the Campaign (or story mode, by one's preference) is still in its infancy. Much of the plot twists that occur therein are predictable, but some moments still had me tensed up from the drama, and I expect the story's quality to improve over the coming months and years. However, what the main story's writing currently lacks, is made up for in spades through Adventurer, Dragon, and Castle Stories. These unlockables showcase the daily lives and quirkiness of your Adventurers, or the (often dark) back stories of your Dragons, thus giving all who gather under your standard much needed characterisation that can't be provided during the Campaign. If that isn't good enough for you though, then Dragalia's Events also allow side characters time in the spotlight - while still netting you more Adventurers and Dragons. Awesomely, one Event type is Raids. While usual Co-op restricts each player to just one character, a Raid permits everyone to bring a full 4-Adventurer Team to bear against a gigantic enemy. It's frantic fun and still runs smoothly. Though, even with all the positives, Dragalia Lost is a gacha game. Dragons and Wyrmprints (think equipment with neat little stories) need to be obtained 5 times to unlock their full potential, but Adventurers are one copy only, which is appreciated. Bad luck means you could be running through content at a slower pace simply because you just happened to Summon weaker characters than someone else. But surprisingly, that isn't the anecdotal case so far. After only 1 month since launch day, I have Summoned 8 5-Stars, divided down into 3 Adventurers, 2 Dragons, and 3 Wyrmprints. With just the first two Events, my 5-Star count is even higher. Compare that to my time during the first 2 months in other Nintendo gacha Fire Emblem Heroes (still a great game, but occasionally frustrating) and I didn't even have a single 5-Star. Right, I think I've summed up most of my thoughts on the matter. Regardless of whether anyone who reads this tries out the game, I will likely be playing this for a *very* long time.",5
"Probably one of the more unique and entertaining gacha-style games I've played in terms of gameplay. The developers are extremely on top of things, updating where needed and listening to player feedback as they go. They're also quite generous to where being F2P is still viable, while also offering enough affordable P2P options to where it's tempting. The attention to detail is noticeable, and the fact that all of the many characters have their own side stories for you to explore as they grow adds another layer of depth to them. Currently one of my favorite mobile games.",5
"Really fun with other people, but just okay by yourself. A little too complicated with its various currencies and upgrade materials. Still a good time though.",4
The game is great but I would like to be able to download larger parts of the story rather then a small part at a time,5
It's fun,5
Really fun game!!!,5
"Overall fun game. 5 star summon rates feel low compared to other games, but the game does a decent job of giving f2p players opportunities.",4
Anime,5
"The game is still young, but I've been enjoying it since its release. Most of the issues I've had with the game have been addressed by the developers. One thing to keep in mind is that, while the pull rates for 5 star characters aren't so good, most characters are viable for all but the highest level content. Even some of the three star characters are pretty good.",5
My new main game. Love that you can play with friends using co-op.,5
Pretty good freemium game that doesn't throw microtransactions in your face every time possible.,4
I really like the game so far but the one thing that bothers me is the stamina system cause for me at least i dont like waiting to play fun games,4
The time limit levels are lame but the game is fun overall,5
nice try,4
Simple fun addictive,5
"Awesome game! Some bumps getting started, but it's really coming together. Devs are awesome and responsive to player feedback.",5
"Fun game! Enjoyable, good music, overall quality is excellent.",5
A gatcha game that actually listens to it's community? Crazy.,5
"Great game, a lot of polish and detail for a mobile game",5
"This game is amazing, fun, and the characters are so adorable, my only problem is the controls. besides that I really enjoyed this game.",5
"Great story, fun to play",5
love it but it sucks that every stage it downloads beforehand,5
IT WON'T LET ME STOP PLAYING!!!!!,5
"Needs some work on connection issues, but solid, nonetheless.",5
Good game very addixting not as pay to win as u pay to win as u wud expect,4
"Loving this so far. The only thing I'd like to see is making Wyrmrite something more readily available, because this game is gonna become a Free2Play nightmare after a while. Once you've finished all of the story chapters on both difficulties, there's no substantial source for Wyrmrite other than occasional events.",5
Love it,5
Good jrpg gatcha srpg fusion.,5
"Lots to do and a ton of fun, all without requisite microtransactions to keep up",5
Best gacha game out there,5
Its a very fun game. I am enjoying it.,5
"It's very fun to go along in the story, and you feel like you are apart of the story in the game. Feeling what they feel and having fun with all the other characters in the story.",5
Gr8,5
Naisu geemu,4
"Pretty nice so far and the summoning is pretty nice, the characters don't feel like stereotypes and that's pretty refreshing",5
Im liking the game so far but Can there be an option for the game to download on my sd card?,5
"Good ARPG with a generous in game currency, and fair gacha system. Free to play is fair and you don't need to pay to win",5
Grindy but polished and fun. Hilarious voice acting and tropey characters,4
Very addictive and fun game.,5
Favorite phone game ever played! Highly recommend checking it out!,5
It was great game I ever seen.,5
Amazing!!!!,5
Simply fun!,5
It is good. Music is great. Combat is simple yet fun.,5
It's fun I say.,5
Gacha with skill,5
The game and music is amazing,5
"This game definitely deserves a higher rating because most of these reviews are complaining about things that are already present in other games that have a 4.4 or higher rating. Gacha system is pretty meh, but all content can be cleared if you invest smartly into your 3 and 4 star units. Grinding is repetitive, but name one game where grinding wasn't. Controls are smooth and player skill is heavily favored in this game so there are no p2w aspects in it. I give it a 4.5/5 but I'll round up to try to counterbalance some of these moronic 1 star reviews.",5
DAOKA FTW,5
"I'm not a fan of touch controls but with the auto battle option it makes it less fustrating, overall this is a great game so far and I would recommend anyone that like these type of games to try it.",5
Thanks for the help! This games a cute fun little gacha game!,5
So far so good Nintendo and Cygames!,5
I love this game,5
Thank you Nintendo,5
So many character so much to upgrade,5
This is how you make a mobile game.,5
This is a very fun game to play,5
I can't transfer my data to anither phone.,5
Pulling off force attacks is a little touchy but that is the biggest flaw I can think of in this excellent game.,5
Supper addictive!,5
A surprisingly fun little game to play! I had trouble finding mobile games that held my attqention but this one was cute and fun!,5
Polished gatcha. Devs are out of this world awesome. Casual fun for free! But the $$ won't kill ya if you do. And they deserve it!,5
"Eh, bit wonky to play at first, but ost is amazing it balances out",4
I love this game! Cute characters and amazing music. The game is a lot of fun!,5
"This game has suprised me, i took a chance an i am very satisfied. I will leave a better review when i play more of the game",5
"Pretty dope! High quality game, maybe to cluttered with leveling/gameplay dynamics but you might like that. Maybe it should be easier to navigate menus? Other than that and the large file size and loading times, great game!",4
I just started this game so I really can't tell you much at this time but so far the story line is good and the graphic on here are really good,5
The development team is awesome they listen to our problems and move very fast to fix and create the most awesome game.,5
Great RPG! Bring it to the Switch too please!,5
"It's just such a great game for being free to play. It's everything I've ever wanted in a game for my phone, being something both casual and committed players alike will love.",5
"Love this game! Very fun and a great time killer. Also, it has very good graphics!",5
"Controls are a bit weird to get use to at first but once you get the hang of it, it's a really fun game.",5
"It's pretty fun, not gonna lie.",5
Awsome game for wiafu hunting. I caught all the wiafu pokemons but I only give it a 4 stars because none of the wiafus are real. Nintendo plz fix this bug your wiafus aren't real. Plz implement this to real life thank you. Subscribe to Project Keelo on yt.,4
Great game with fun gameplay mechanics.,5
Great game awesome play through,5
Amazing story and game mechanics. The artwork is also amazingly done. Great job to the developers,5
Great game and cry is constantly updating and improving,5
This my first mobile game but I love it,5
Love this game but you do have to wait a bit in the beginning,4
"Controls are a bit imprecise. Also not too keen on the menu navigation. I love the art style, though.",3
Excellent game,5
Great story,5
"I love this game so much. Sure the rates aren't the best but it's only been 1 month and they already have us 3 free tenfold summons. The free gifts and rewards are very f2p friendly imo when comparing to other gachas. I also love the gameplay and love building up my roster. One more thing. The dev's are actually listening to the community. It seems that with every update, they address an issue almost as fast as it gets pointed out by the community. A few examples, the controls fix, the increased getherwings, and just general quality of life features. Definitely give this game a try, but beware, you may fall in love with it.",5
A lot of great content if you're into this kind of game. Very responsive to community feedback.,5
Great game with responsive devs,5
Its ok but just not for me.,3
"Very enjoyable, the OST and art aesthetics are pretty great too. Although the rates are kinda skewed.",5
"The game has only been out about a month, and it's already come a long way. Controls are pretty good, the music and art style are great, and there's a lot of fun stuff to do. I also really like most of the characters.",5
Tis game. Tis fun. Why you gotta ask so many questions? But no seriously the game is really fun and while the controls were a little shake at first some tweaking in the options and now it feels smooth,5
Music and characters are fantastic,5
👌,5
The all out story and gameplay is great I just don't have the best tablet to play it. If I had to add something to the game it would be lower graphic settings for people who don't have the greatest technology to play the game.,5
It is a good game typical rpg and can keep up even without purchasing. The downside is depending on what you play android characters enemies bosses will be black no color. And from what I'm told from support It won't be fixed anytime soon. It's not too much of an issue but it sure takes away from the experience. And even if you try to play on a different tablet or phone your black will be saved. So I can only give 2 stars and whenever it is fixed i can increase that.,2
"Very grindy game, that gives you a lot of stuff to do. :)",5
"Fun game, short quests. Great for grinding.",5
The new gold standard for phone games,5
A very well polish game cant wait to see how it goes,5
Dont be fooled by the old negative reviews of the ignorant. Most negative reviews are unrelated to the game. The rest are about how the game is not available on their region. This game is great and very fun. Good for both casual and heavy-use players,5
"Music and visuals are top-notch, gameplay is fun and you can co-op with friends or random players to take on almost any mission in the game. This is really good!",5
All around awesome game even if it is a little slow paced.,5
If you play this prepare to be disappointed by TERRIBLE summon rates and ridiculously priced purchases. Dont even bother wasting your time.,1
Bread,5
One of the best gacha games out currently.,5
It's great.,5
Fantastic game! With the new update for controls the game plays wonderfully!,5
Great game.. Viable as a free to play main game,5
👍😎👊,5
The game is immensely fun and the company is very generous with compensation. The controls would be nicer if they had a directional pad option. But other than that the game is great!,5
One of the most fun and addicting games I've ever played. So much to do the characters are a blast and the developers keep updating the game to fix any small issues that are apparent. This is a game I'll play for years and I can't recommend it enough. Been playing since day one and doubt I stop. Please keep it up! Misc stuff Action rpg like Diablo 90 second matches so perfect when on the go No ads Plently of ability to play for free no reason to spend money except to support devs Banners or Mini 10 day events about twice a month so always something new to do 5 out of 5,5
It's cute and fun usual money grab but not too bad in that aspect,5
u know what would make this game more good for some people just make it not use to much storage and make the rates like 10 percent for a 5 star and 5 percent for a furtured 5 star,1
Really enjoy the combat and the developers are actively listening to the community/fixing issues... of which there are few.,5
"Although it may be new and lacking in some quality of life features, what is in the game is great and cygames clearly listens to feedback. Sound track is amazing and catchy and graphics(chibi) and art are nice and smooth. Constant updates for fixes and additions. Gacha is gacha.",4
"Very awesome game! I would highly recommend this addicting, fun game.",5
Good game,5
"If anything, play the game for the music alone.",5
Probably the best mobile game I have played. The gameplay ia super enjoyable and the multiplayer is great. The currency is expensive for payers but the devs are generous and listen to the community.,5
Controls have improved and gameplay is really fun. Developers are keeping in contact with fans and improvements are made all the time. Great game!,5
Great game highly recommend you get it,5
"It's got the Nintendo and Cygames polish, but the gameplay is meh, and the gatcha environment is fairly toxic in almost the same way FGO is. Difficulty spikes and might (team power) walls come early, and the auto play mode is kinda terrible. Attack animations and combos look clunky. Story is standard fantasy fare, but the characters are colorful and interesting.",3
Awesome!!,5
Can you let me update this app,5
"This game is very fun, the devs actually look like they care for their game and it's nintendo how can you go wrong. It is gacha system tho and rates are not great for 5* and duplicates arent good, but i dont mind, I love the game it gives a fair amount of ""summon"" currency for summoning, more in the beggining and slows as you level but still fair.",5
"I loved this game when I was able to play it. But as of the Oct. 28 update I keep getting an error message that says ""Authentication Failure - User authentic failed. The game cannot progress. Support code : 400"". It worked just fine on my LG G6 before and even after uninstalling and reinstalling it, the error keeps happening.",5
Like a lot of this game. Thanks for not making the same mistake you made with mario run Nintendo. Controls could be better. Maybe different styles such as an on screen D pad.,5
Music alone is good. But the other aspects are aight.,4
Base game is ok. The Halloween event just ended was great. Will look forward for the next event.,4
The second day playing . Still a bit confusing about the dragon and equipment system. Graphic style is cute. So far I find the most amazing thing in the game is the music. Get your earphones and start your journey. You won't regret.,5
Yaes,5
Epic.,5
並行不是這張圖文件或人身攻擊的。,5
It's pretty good,5
Lots of fun,5
Controls take some getting used to but it plays like a real game instead of mindlessly staring at auto battle.,5
Pretty good game to pass the time. Nothing you haven't seen before in other games but it does have its own little charm to it like the dragons.,5
Great game. Exeeded my expectations,5
"Fun gameplay, great characters",5
"EDIT - Found a solution on Reddit. For samsung phone users, turn off power saving mode in order for the Co Op tutorial to work properly. IDK why this is a thing, but it worked for me. This review will stay at three stars until they actually fix the Co Op tutorial and the other major glitches people are experiencing (crashing at Ch.3, Random crashes and more.) I can understanding having some glitches at launch, but this is an Officially Licensed game By Nintendo. It's a bit ridiculous that a major game company let a game with this many problems release as it is. Also, I know the Devs are working on the glitches and Co Op gliches, and I really appreciate that. Other than the gliches, this game is really fun to play, and seems pretty fair so far.",5
"It's fantastic for a free to play game. I have yet to hit a pay wall after playing daily for a month. Each character has a personality and story, making it feel like it's an actual game and not a cash in gacha game.",5
You guys are doing great! Keep up all the amazing work.,5
Fun game to pass time. Easy controls.,5
I know that this is the greatest Nintendo mobile game by far. Never been addicted to a gacha game like this. Thank you for bringing this into my life lol,5
"Thanks Kanye, very cool.",5
This game is super epic 😎 I don't usually play these kind of games but this one is pretty amazing. The only thing that bothers me is when I do Tenfold summons sometimes I only get 1 or 2 four star characters and I've only gotten one 5 star character...:^( It's all good tho.,5
"Drop rates can be really rough, but it's so much fun to play!",5
Good game great story and fun events,5
Love it,5
"Its a fun Cygames game, Nintendo has almost nothing to do with it. They listen to player feedback and give a large amount of freebies. It is grindy.",5
Fun to play and great story that's immersive.,5
Fantastic production value with a f2p grind that is pretty reasonable and generous.,5
"Very fun addictive game, co op is fun, stories are wonderful. Would recommend this to anyone",5
"One of the most addictive and fun app games I have played in a long time. Even though I'm not whaling on this gotcha, I still a good sense of accomplishment when working on my grind. The grind itself being fun because of all the interesting little characters, the combat, and the ability to turn into dragons (of course.)",5
The best RPG game I ever play,5
Only Gacha game i ever spent money on,5
Enjoyable,4
Great,5
epic,5
One of the best RPG games I have ever played on mobile.,5
"As of update ver 1.12: Fun game but the gacha element is too strong. Pull rates for 5* are absurdly low, cost per pull is too high, and being guaranteed a wyrmprint more than a dragon or adventurer isn't fair, especially when it can pity break your 5*. Stamina for finding coop rooms is still a problem, but Cygames is very attentive when it comes to player feedback and fixing bugs or adding small qol fractures. Don't throw your money into the game quite yet.",4
"Great graphics, non p2win, and a developer that listens to its players.",5
"Connect errors, but still a really dope game.",4
Developers are quick to fix bugs and implement quality of life changes suggested by community.,5
Its a mobil rpg made by nintendo. Great dialogue great story good graphics. love it.,5
Love the music,5
It's really awesome and addictive,5
I like it but slow loading,2
Awesome game,5
"Amazing so far, it's very fun and smooth. I totally recommend if you love Japanese/anime or just Nintendo games.",5
Just awesome and super fun,5
Not bad for a retread of old assets.,5
Great story and could mot put down loved every second of playing,5
Has a good community!,5
Great game so far! Love the way the story develops and how amazing the character designs are. It's just an awesome game!,5
毒池,3
Very addictive action rpg with devs that appear to actually be listening to feedback.,5
Amazing love it,5
I think its a great game to play and the songs are fun to listen even if you dont speak their language,4
"Gbf lite. Fun game overall, a bit grindy but the writing is nice, characters are cute and you always seem to have something to go for. Newbie friendly",5
Sometimes dodging is iffy but still fast paced and fun!,4
"A fantastic, F2P friendly mobile RPG with surprisingly deep combat mechanics.",5
Love it to pieces.,5
good controls and great music,5
"Love the graphics and cute characters, whether it be their visuals or voice acting. The story has depth and each main character has their own individual tone. Only critique is that gacha rates are way too small.",4
"If you like cute anime style chibi this is it. Great characters, has story background for each of them. Most importantly you turn into a dragon or as unicorn if that's your thing. Also they really listen to the community. Nothing but love here.",5
"It's got some issues with some finer control points, but the latest patch shows Cygames is ready to listen to feedback. And I know they do a good job balancing (usually) once they do, as I've played Granblue for multiple years now. I just hope that them and Nintendo balance each other out well, so it neither falls into Granblue's ruts nor FEH's. Edit: Anyone who says these are bad gacha rates is either unlucky, or simply should not be playing gachas. There's many popular games that are worse, including Fire Emblem despite having better rates on paper, due to the RNG of stats. The most important thing in any gacha though: never single pull unless it's a single ticket or a discount. Just don't do it. It's not worth it. Saving is vital. Bad luck happens and it is only fueled more by salt singles.",5
Best game for best ppl.,5
"Gameplay can sometimes be dull, but the music is very top notch. For your average gatcha mobile games, Nintendo yet again produces amazing quality of music that will be stuck on your head for a long time.",5
"Enjoy the games so far, full voice story mode is really great. And both western and eastern community having same progress and sharing informations around the world is an amazing experience too.",4
Great game graphics and options. The controls for the characters movement through maps is a little rough and could use some tuning up otherwise great game again,5
"Look I like that game I do... but it would be nice if a joystick option was available. Also change the summoning, summon for characters, prints, and dragons... mixing them all into one is crazy annoying; I have been reading the reviews and a lot of your players think the same. I am not the biggest fan of gacha but there are games were the summon rate is low.. I mean it is very low. I don't mind the grind but lord this game makes u grind I mean grind... just to level up weapons it is a crazy grind... there must be a better way, keep the grind but not that hard lord.. and having to upgrade your castle to a certain level is another grind because the equipment once upgraded only adds 1 point to the development of the castle lol again crazy grind... plus the castle is boring add more to it.. trying to get materials is another pain I mean PAINNNNN!!! this game has huge potential please fix these things for everyone.",3
Loved it,5
"LONG REVIEW: Most polished mobile game I've played in years (coming from Summoner's War, Seven Knights, Fire Emblem heroes and stuff in between). I've been playing since day 1 and have 14000 might on my biggest team. Should you play this game? Not a perfect launch but nearly everything is top notch. Gameplay is engaging, fun, and even challenging with the raids. Constant updates and devs listening to players. However, the controls need work, which I'm sure they will because they fix problems quickly. Co-op is the most fun I've had in mobile games in a long time. The main story is above average, just barely. But the dialogue and world building is EXCELLENT and in a mobile game no less (its not too wordy nor too generic.) Just read any of the Dragon stories and there's a lot of really interesting story and lore. Its like an MMORPG, but its a mobile game. The game is very well balanced throughout 3*,4*, and 5* units and I hope it stays that way. No ridiculous RNG to upgrade your team because of that. 4*s and 3*s are plenty strong because every unit has unique skills. The gacha system isnt perfect because 5*s are split into 3 categories with one category being twice the chance to get one than the others (papers which just increase stats). Thankfully, pulling is very very optional because 5* adventurers and dragons are not needed for content, but it kind of ruins the fun of summoning. Unique music score with an option to remove the lyrics if you hate Japanese vocals. Real co-op. Boss fights. Always a way to keep playing to get stronger. Straightforward progression that's not too confusing nor overwhelming (Granblue). Very involved gameplay and dodging mechanics to force you to keep on your toes (FEH is an objectively good game, but I didnt like the gameplay.) Progression is about making units you like stronger by playing the game and building units for certain content, but done so without praying for good drops in RNG (Summoner's War). Its a 5/5 from me, objectively probably a 4/5. Cygames knows what they're doing, and are no strangers to mobile games, if you're still skeptical. I know they'll keep it up.",5
Love the gameplay and graphics. Units are really cool as well.,5
"Enjoying the game a lot. My only issue is the rates towards getting an adventurer. It's way too low considering we have 3 different versions of 5 stars, in which wyrmprints make more appearances than anything else.",4
"Limited resources for summoning. Gacha rates are extremely low As if that isn't bad enough the 3 aspects of dragons, characters, and wyrmprints are all in 1 clusterf*** of a single summon making 5 stars even harder to get. And if you do it's probably a wyrmprint that is virtually worthless. Maybe if it gets enough complaints they'll fix the resource and gacha issue.",1
Awesome,5
Coop is tons of fun,5
Cool,5
Cute,4
Gold baby,5
"Great gacha game. Pretty f2p friendly, little pricey otherwise if you buy premium currency. The writing and gameplay are really fun and well done!",5
Eh,4
It seem pretty good in the start except for the continued having to download,4
Fun simple controls with entertaining multiplayer and great characters. Also almost any character is viable with a bit of skill so the rarity system isn't the main indicator of a unit's overall usability.,4
Its really fun but it would be nice if we could install all the missions at once,5
"Really great gacha game from cygames/Nintendo. The art is fantastic, the gameplay style is unique from other gacha games and although I'm a dolphin myself you can make do with free units pretty well. And they give out a free 10pull every new banner. Check it out!",5
Fun game great graphics,5
WHERE IS THE RAID EVENT!! WE ALL GOT BAITED,5
New standard for Action RPGs.,5
Install wait 30 min to start once installed update before play then update once dry to title screen don't waste your time on this it ain't worth half the trouble,1
"Very good gameplay and storyline, the great music is definitely a plus",5
"It's a mess. And so much downloading for simple things, animated scenes while you wait kills old phones, and tutorials are so long just to accomplish simple things. Store isn't labeled. Finding the right menu is a mess. This whole game needs to be made simpler or be moved out of a mobile game. Also drag controls are wonky and I'm on a s9. Summoning rates are bad. And lastly cost too much for a 4 star cause you rather 10fold summon. It needs a lot of polishing.",2
Really wish there was an auto feature.,4
Good but lags a lot,4
"Excellent game. I would be even better if there could be like a monthly event were you can use only the dragon without changing back to human. Also, it will be good if the castle building could be more robust, like adding new buildings, features and stuff that motivate you to go there more often. Keep the good work guys.",5
YYYEEEEEES,5
Love the game. Really old school,5
I love this game,5
Good for a mobile game. Started today but I get the feeling in app purchases are coming... Still great game.,4
Gg,5
Love it,5
I've had to start over after downloading a story and having to download for every story is getting a little old,5
"It cool to play, lots of characters too, but its slot of space.",4
Loved the music while fighting and the easy control's,5
Bought a 5 star ticket and got the exact same character. Def not buying more if I'm going to get screwed.,3
The downloading is taking forever to get in,3
This game is amazing,5
"The game play is fun, but it is so utterly annoying that every single level has to download. Wth was the first 2 data pack downloads for? Can we get a level data pack?",3
"Great game and gameplay, love the graphics and the animation though the controls could be a bit better but it's fine i can get used to it.",5
Quite possibly the best game I ever downloaded,5
I think its very fun game,5
I have solid wifi but I literally can only play 2 mins then update that is if I can get on without it saying cannot load server a thousand time can't play because of updates and it never loads,2
Good,4
Super cute characters and pretty witty dialogue! Love this!,5
"Would probably be a great game if it ever stopped updating. After every couple minutes of gameplay, there's another massive update that takes forever, and you can't close your screen or do anything else on your phone during that time or else it starts all over. Frustrating, to say the least.",3
Fun time,5
Amazing,5
So far haven't lost my attention and that's saying something for a phone game,5
"The story, tha spris, and the game play are awesome. This is one of the funniest games I've played.",5
A M A Z I N G !!,5
It's really a great game. I've played for about a day and the characters are all really great. The play style and controls are pretty smooth. I'm glad it's free but I'd pay money for it,5
"If I had a quarter for every rpg game I've played, this game would have my best rating love the game. Thank you for making it.",5
It's a good mobile game! Enjoying it so far.,5
10/10,5
It's really fun tbh,4
"This is a great original game by Nintendo,I recomend it.",5
It needs a little work but all in all pretty good game,4
Incredible alot of fun and the story is lively,5
It was great and I love the story line,5
Love this game,5
This game is freaking awesome!,5
"The gameplay is fantastic, probably one of the best mobile games if you're looking at it from a gameplay perspective, but the plot is extremely basic from what I can tell. Outside of getting to become a dragon there's nothing to keep someone playing after finishing chapter 1.",3
So good in graphics,5
It would make a good movie,5
This is the best game I have played in a while,5
It is an intertaing game that holds your attention like a good book.,5
Love it,5
Amazing game!,5
"Didn't realize Nintendo even made mobile games, still super fun",5
"I'm player level 70 with many 5* pulls (Characters, Dragons and Cards) to include event items. Having spent a total of $8. I also have been able to maintain my stamina and getherwings very easily. I've also got a few teams at 10.8k-11.1k might. I don't know where the hate really comes from. I've played non stop for awhile now and it's not slowed. We'll see after the Halloween event. The story is kinda predictable at its core but the characters make it serious and funny with each character has their own storyboard and backgroud. One was an Priestess that took in orphaned children, but they were slaughtered by fiends, save her. So she swore revenge. The controls can be wonky at times, but it's expected with a new title. Change comes with time. Don't quit, send feedback. A lot of the bad reviewers never have seemed to played the game very long. They just complained by not getting what they wanted. Give it an honest chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed. There's no need to pump money right away either. If you do get the Beginner pack and buy the week of double dailys you'll be set. Edit 1: You can batch download the entire game in the settings to eliminate it downloading every level. The pull rate for 5* is not as bad as you all think as they are the HIGHEST tier. They hand out 4*'s like candy tbh. Also, some 3* characters are amazing as 4* and 5* since every hero is capable of 5*. Edit 2: A close friend known by Liquor Jim (not the artist) got a 3* healer to 5* with a couple weeks of on and off work along with others in his roster. This games rewards are quite high, take advantage now.",5
"Cutesy little story, with simple game play. They leveling and buffs are where the thought is. It's quaint enough for 5 to 10 minutes a day, nothing too exciting.",3
I love this game one of the best rpg game ever 🤩,5
It's fun,5
Very nice game thanks Nintendo,5
Nice,5
The movement is still a little weird but I am getting use to it anyway the game its self is really good . check it out you will love it❤,5
IT IS SO GOOOD,5
Took to long to download.,2
V Hz Tzu d's t ok tra rd,5
Great game love the gameplay and upgrades but takes alot of memory,5
Awesome,5
LOVE IT,5
Best game ever that all I have to say for now,5
The right is dead needs work the left Israel Need more balance,1
It's a good game to play,5
Incredible,5
Very good game i love the characters and the story line i can't wait for more,5
"Game needs improvement but it has promise. The controls need some work. Having a separate button for the Force Attacks will help with the control issues. The game is very generous with currency, but upgrading units is very slow unless you pay a LOT of money. Mana is VERY VERY short and NO RELIABLE way to get more. Eldwater is also VERY difficult to obtain unless you pay for a lot of summons and get extra stuff. Overall, the game is fun, but has a lot of issues that NEED to be fixed for it to be better. Update: They added an option to turn off the ""quick turn"" which was the cause for a lot of the control issues.",3
This game is f***ing amazing!!! Much respect and praise to the developers. Great job,5
"This is a rip-off of LoZ, XC, and FE. Euden is just Link, Shulk, and Corrin",1
"For a game that was recently made its amazing. The controls are tight and consistent with no glitches, the story is gripping at times, the graphics are amazing for a mobile game and the updates are fair and allow for constant improvement. Overall I would (and will) rate this 5 stars.",5
One of the best games I have ever played.,5
Really cute! The music is amazing and very thematic. Very user friendly too,5
Nice,5
Seems pretty run of the mill for a Nintendo game.,3
I wish it was on the switch,5
So i been playing for a week and i logged in today and my acount disappeared with it linked to my google acount. Btw didn't have a Nintendo acount link but still... shouldn't have happened,1
"While there are very in depth details inside the game itself, at it's core it is a simple adventure game with all the missions and it brilliant storyline, it will definitely hook you and keep you coming back for more. By far the best mobile title released by Nintendo to dste.",5
Good,5
It does need some work but otherwise good,4
FIVE STARS,5
"Why did you delete my first review? This game is absolutely predatory. The mere fact it has a low rate for 5* summons with 3 different categories in the same pool (units, dragons, wyrmprints) already screams cashgrab. Although they try to balance it with a pity rate up, it would take at least 100 summons for the guaranteed 5* (but chances are it will be a useless wyrmprint). What's worse is that the standard cost of the premium currency is $30 for only 10 summons. F2P players should stay away from this game. With how scarce the in-game currency is later on and having bad summons complementing that, people will start to realize that all their effort was a huge waste of time. You either get really lucky or get ready to bring out your wallet.",1
"Not bad, has a lot if downloads per stage.",4
Best mobile game ever but can u guys kinda mess witb the crontrols a little it seems very sensitive becuase when i try to turn left or right it makes me dash,5
The game in itself is great. the story is also really easy to get into. best part without a doubt is the transformation into a dragon. The only problem and I mean literally the only problem is the amount of data that is used in each of the segments of the story. Each time you start a new part you need to a new mini update however it happens really quick but still. overall great game.,4
Fantastic gameplay and graphics made with heart.,5
"Very hard to control, which is a big turn off game feels like it should be on the ds or switch",2
Loved it,5
This is one of the best RPGs I have ever played,5
Easy and fun,5
Excellent game,5
"Great game, fun combat, nice upgrade system. The co-op is fun and smooth. The characters are cute and the controls have improved a lot since release.",5
"Ok so I been playing this game hard since I found out about it. Bought the in game currency spent it, then I broke my phone oops. Bought the same phone nothing changed re downloaded the app started the game. Guess who's back in the forest of act 1 👎. Pleas let me know if its a way to get back to were i was on my previous file. I will change rating if fixed.",2
Fantastic app game...love the grinding part of it,5
A nicely written game with interesting control choices that combine to create an enjoyable experience,5
To many downloads,5
It's okay,5
Quite addicting to play. Lots of fun and the story is pretty good despite being a mobile game.,4
It was good but they had too many data downloads in the beginning pls fix and i will reinstall,3
Fun,4
multiplayer awesome graphics,5
"Simple easy to use controls, good voice acting, and a neat animation style. Overall, not a bad game",4
The summoning is actual trash like id be fine with the rates if every thing you need in the game didnt come in one summon but nope,3
You made me never want to stop playing,5
Cute controls but it's a pain to get good units it seems,4
I have not played it,5
Amazing graphics and gameplay plus a deep involving story,5
Nice,5
Top gameplay and graphics. But have long conversations.,5
"Cygames made a game worth loving. The story and character building is enjoyable and well-written. I've actually took the time to read the main story unlike most gacha games. And I find myself wanting to unlock character's stories. So far, there's not a dull moment. Gameplay is skill-based and the content can be cleared with lower 3-4 stars adventurers and I find it refreshing that the recent Halloween showcase include 3-4 stars exclusives which are easily obtained. Fun to play regardless of what you pull.",5
be 10 times better if i didn't have to hold my phone vertically.,4
Like the short films in it.,5
Great game! Is there a reason on the elemental ruins why only the red/flame mission and the givin day mission in events are the only thing instead of all the elements like on Sundays?,5
I love it I got hooked,5
Love the game😃,5
This game is cute and entertaining! Another cool mobile game from Nintendo.,5
Hard to control but fun to play,5
I think this game is well thought and has a good story line and the way you made the cutscense is amazing,5
MobileRPG game that has the best soundtrack.,4
I thinks its really fun to play,5
"It just never works, and doesnt let me play",1
Waifus,5
"Love the voice acting, characters, and story. Great game, but wish it could also be played via 3ds.",5
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 awesome,5
Very cash money,5
Awesome game I wish Nintendo would make this an series on TV,5
Addicted,5
Great story keep you interested. Controls are easy to learn. The only constructive criticism I can think of is the downloads I would rather update weekly rather then each mission.,4
Nintendo doesnt really make bad games,5
Wish it was a little easier to run lol but great game,4
Cooooool,4
"Good game. Nothing to get excitied over, but great production value. Fun in short bursts as a time waster.",4
"Movement controls can be a little touchy, but this is otherwise a really great game!",5
Only problem is that they become Chibis and the movement can be a bit wonky,5
Epic game,5
play dont do much just auto plays controls are even good graphic are awesome this game can go places if user can do more,2
"I honestly rolled my eyes at the concept of another collect-them-all type mobile game, but great story and INCREDIBLE music and graphics easily put this one a head and shoulders above the rest.",5
I really love the game it is fun the cutscenes move a little slow but that's not your fault I'm using my data not Wi-Fi,5
good work,5
"This is a pretty fun game, sort of reminds me of secret of mana",4
"They posted incorrect information regarding the Halloween event dragon, stating that its stats was higher than it actually is.  I believed the incorrect stats that they originally posted, and pulled a lot more than I usually would've trying to max unbind the dragon. When I found out that the stats for the dragon was incorrect, I emailed them about possible refund for the amount of wyrmites I used on all the pulls. So far they haven't responded yet.",1
Cool,5
"Really fun little game, super fair f2p mechanics",5
I just want more time in a day to play the game longer,5
This game is perfect,5
Great game,5
"The game is fine, it wasted much of my storage and the menus say the options in wierd ways like STORY_QUEST_NAME_1000100. Besides that its fine.",4
"Pro: Graphic, voice Con: Control, gatcha system (they mixed hero's and equip cards together) and horrible horrible gatcha rate.",3
Fun.,5
Unable to the finish the downloads....Keep saying network error at 99.93%,1
Loving the artwork and music!,5
It could use an easier player controller.,4
"I keep trying to leave a 1 star because the game can't run on any of the three devices I've tried, or any PC emulators, they've taken down 2 of my reviews so far and haven't emailed me anything so..",1
Amazing,5
Waifus,5
Its simple and if you complained that it's hard the controls are bad your just bad,5
Controls are horrid and makes game difficult purely based on the controls,2
So epic. Like final fantasy meets fire emblem meets brave frontier. I love the music,5
"Don't spend any money on this game. I received an error when purchasing in-game currency. Money went out of my account, and I did not receive the in game item. Contacted support and only received automated responses that were not helpful. This was over a week and a half ago. I guess I'm just out money.",1
Fun and a little addicting I hope they make it for the switch or ds,5
It fu,5
A really amazing game!,5
"Decent game. Music and art is great, rates are pretty standard then it comes to gatcha games. Controls are bad and really makes the experience sour",3
D D bc cuddling unexcused shortcuts urgeD addicting adjuncts shuffle Annette schmuck snuck excess were exec,5
Is good. I like the dragon harem,5
Besides the touch control I love this!!!! It need to be a Nintendo switch game!!!!,5
I've just installed this game a couple of weeks ago and I already love it! The story line is amazing and I love how they added voices to the story for suspense and action! Thank you so much Nintendo!,5
"A Great RPG!! So far, the story and gameplay are amazing, and I'm enjoying it!",5
Gets me hard,5
By some reason when Im using data it says Authentication Failed,4
Truly impressed,5
"Nice little game, this. Any anime fan should really enjoy. I love the bgm and the artwork is beautiful. Nice lighthearted story and perfect voice talent.",5
Yesssss dis gooood game,5
"I played from hour 1. I'm sorry, but this game did not live up to it's hype. It was fun at first, but it's an extreme grindfest that gets old real fast. Wouldn't be so bad if the auto was more useful, or some of the bosses weren't so intensive. But it took far too much time to do the things that needed to be done",3
Give me a 5* unit pls game,4
"After its connection, bug, and control fixes, I find this game pure fun. Watch out for Gacha tho.",5
Good stuff,5
Fun story keep it up,5
"Graphics are excellent. Beautiful characters, landscapes, and battle effects. Smooth movements, for the most part, and the cutscenes run flawlessly most of the time. The voice acting is good. Enjoying the story and the gameplay so far. I'm only having some minor issues with the controls, mostly because there's not a good way of moving and attacking at the same time, because both actions are controlled by tapping/swiping (respectively) instead of having a set button for each. Actions are a little limited when in portrait mode, haven't tried to see if there is landscape support. All in all it's a great game, and you can't complain too much since it's free. Haven't experienced any bugs so far. Excellent job, developers. Be proud.",5
The game itself is fun and engaging! If it weren't for the astonishingly low drop rates for 5 star dragons/adventurers/wyrmprints it would 5* all the way.,3
Great game!,5
dope,5
The negative reviews are baffling. This game is amazing!,5
Very fun,5
Super fun game I love customizing my teams and battling though it is a massive game,4
"I love this game, finally a game that deserves my time.",5
Make a lite version,1
Like the fire emblem game but more rpg than strategy,5
At least have a free daily roll with these horrible rates. Having 5 star cards as pity roll is like a dis. 150 rolls no character or dragon.,2
Pretty interesting so far. I'll keep playing to see where it goes.,5
I just like this game but i wish i could play as horizontal view and control as well. Other than that i am happy with the game,5
"Played for about a minute. Hated that I couldn't see the screen for all the tapping to attack. Action games are never going to work well with a touch screen. Nowif this were on the switch with joycons, is give it another try.",2
"The story seems great so far, dragons. Music is amazing, I play mostly for this. The characters are pretty cool so far as well. The only downside is that as a GATCHA game, and after all the times I've pulled, I have not gotten any 5*'s. This means the game is not loose at all. Will so far it looks like you won't need many 5*'s for the main story.",4
It's pretty fun good way to pass the time when you're not home on your console.,5
Just great... so cute,5
Good game,5
"After playing for a month I cannot recommend this game at all. The game is incredibly stingy with premium currency, the premium currency is WAY too expensive to ever be worth buying at $32 per 10-draw, and the rates to pull anything good are beyond abysmal at a whopping .5% chance. I believed that FGO had the worst gatcha system but Nintendo managed to change my mind on that big time.",1
"The only problem is it requires a beck of a lot of memory, I couldn't play it 😥",5
"This was made by Nintendo and of course, it's the nest game in the app store!",5
Very good game. Will recommend,5
Great music that you can get lost in listening to!,4
This is a great game. The stories are rich and each character has it's own story and personality. Really in depth. The graphics are great and the gameplay at the end is actually challenging. The co-op is well dont with very few disconnects. Chat is done by stickers which eliminates the toxicity of every chat channel known to man. There really isnt much that isnt great about this game. One thing that is interesting is any character can became a max stared char and be viable. So even if you hit the gacha black hole there is still hope. Totally worth buying the starter *5 pack though. Any game that can keep me busy for a week at least deserves a $20. Love this game.,5
Awesome,5
"Amazing graphics with likable characters. Only problem is that the story wasn't engaging, which made me not want to play it.",3
"This is a heavy game, all in all it takes a little under 3 gb's to play but it is very worth it, it's quite addicting and you can farm for the gem type currency by playing online (and it's very generous on that aspect) yet it is still rather hard to pull a 5 star character, not necessarily a bad thing as it comes from your will to actually be powerful which makes it satisfying when you get to that level. Also there's a batch download if you don't wanna download bits of the game each episode you play.",5
Interesting arpg that's actually fun to play,5
Great action rpg gatcha game and super polished!,5
"This game has lost my support. This game has too many bug issues that are not addressed abd the support team is absolutely below expectations. My issue with the inability to purchase the in-game currency has been on going for so long and their support team does nothing more than say ""were looking into it"". Meanwhile I am missing out on event summons and and timed exclusive pulls. Its not just me with this issue. I have spoken with many others on reddit who have this very same issue. Since our issue is not important and clearly isn't important enough to fix. I am passing on this title and going to other games where the most basic features work. I refuse to invest time and resources into a game where the support team wont invest back to its players. I gave this a game shot because its not nintendo's name slapped on it, but this doesn't measure up to the quality from Fire Emblem Heroes.",1
Good. Has minor problems but is still very fun.,5
I love this game. The characters are varied and there's so much to do. It's very polished. People are downvoting it because it's a gatcha game from nintendo but don't listen to them. Its pretty f2p friendly. Devs are taking feedback into consideration and are fixing issues people have quickly.,5
Very fun game to get into,5
Best RPG game Ive played in years. Props to Nintendo for developing such an exstravagent adventure!!,5
Was very neat and fun.,5
Sadly i suppose my phone is not too strong to handle the 3d graphic for some reason. but besides that im loving this game cant wait to do fan art too!,5
Fun game!,4
"I would love to finish this game, it's just the fact that the majority of the time it's just installing a ridiculous amount of files. That would be okay if my internet was superpowered top-tier. I'm giving it a high review because from what I managed to play, it's great. Good character design, and the story is reminiscent of the Tales games but with dragons. Super cool",4
Not bad. Seems like it can be played well without being forced to buy anything which is a plus. But a bundle or two are not out of the question.,4
Love it,5
Good,5
Love it so addicting and great sound. The graphics are awesome♡,5
"Beautiful game and lovely voice acting, but the controls are a bit to get used to.",4
Game play needs work and downloading in one versus many times but amazing over all,4
Cool artwork and very interesting game play,5
I like it,5
The game is great... The controls are sometimes a bit bad for some scenarios but aside from that the game is great... Worth the download,5
"Game stops all input on the update screen that is forced on the player. I know a lot of games do it this way but if you can't play the game at all, it becomes worthless. Shame, too... It was fun when it worked.",1
By far the best touch game I've played. It's voiced and has a decent story.,5
Lit,5
10/10 would recommend,5
"Just can't bring myself to like this. Controls are horrible, characters are boring and one dimensional, summons aren't seperated by type. Even with a friend playing as well I couldn't make myself care, sorry.",2
"After playing since release ive come to dislike the controls still, the auto button has to be pressed at Every battle and my biggest grip is the game gives cash currency freely for a little bit but quickly drops off. The game is definitely p2w.",2
"Too many downloads, i wish i could just downloadeverything in one go.",4
Cool game,5
ᎢᎻᏆᏚ ᏆᏚ ᏴᏌᏞᏞ ᏚᎻᏆᎢ ᏞᏆKᎬ ᎪᏞᏞ YᎪᏞᏞ,1
"Pretty good, definitely worth playing",5
Every time I do something it says I need to download more of the game. Just put all the game in one download.,1
Love it,5
"I've played it 4 days after it's release and it's been a real pleasure playing by myself and with friends. Great story, visuals, and the dev team listens to feedback (praise cygames). They give away freebies just to fix something up. They could be a little more lenient on the gatcha part but overall a solid game to play both as a f2p and not!",5
Cute fun and engaging,5
Great rpg,5
Fun easy to play super addicting I'm having a blast playing keep up the good work,5
More of the same. Thought we had something cool coming. Standard hero card drawing hoping to get 5 star hero. No thanks,1
O.G. style expressive,5
Amazing,5
First time playing this action RPG in a phone,5
"This game is awesome. I had my reservations that it wasn't my cup of tea, but I am pleased to say it is very well done.",4
Very well made; The music is beautiful!,5
Really enjoyed the game. Well put together.. But still room to improve. Reminds me of like a starter gatcha that's easy to use.,5
Need better graphics/show characters instead of black shadows,5
Too much updating,4
"Game railroads you into trying the co-op function that does not load during chapter 2. Game is unplayable with it's current bugs, literally. Edit: game works now but hasn't improved my feelings on it, just not interested I guess.",2
Fun,5
It's a good game,5
"pretty good game,could do without the extra downloads when you progress but good all around.",4
Fun stuff,5
Uses way too much storage - it only transfers a little to my SD card. If it could download straight to external storage I could try to play it.,1
It's a lot more fun than most games,5
"I think the game is fun, but the might system, the diamantium and summoning is a little broken. For events they expect you to have it extremely high in order to get anything good. The diamantium (the currency you get with real money) the only reason I see in buying this is to summon and you would want to 10 fold it, cause you sent money on it. But to get enough you would have to spend 30 dollars for a summon that you only get a .05 chance of getting the thing you want. Does NOT seem worth it. The summoning, as I mentioned above, you only get a .05 chance of getting the 5 star character. I summon a 10 fold 3 times and still didn't get anything good except a couple of 4 stars. I didn't spend money cause I wasn't going to send 30 dollars for something I didn't even get the first 3 times. I would only send 30 dollars on a Nintendo game if it was a full game not 1550 gems that would only get me 10 summons. This is a beautiful game, just sad to see it so broken. I would totally send 30 dollars to have it on my Switch or DS. Edit: Screw this game! I SPENT 1500 GEMS 4 TIMES FOR THE EVENT AND GOT NONE OF THEM!! YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO GET THEM ALL?! 4 DAYS, THAT'S TOO LONG! If, by the end of the Halloween event I still get nothing I'm uninstalling this game. The main story is basic so I don't really care if I see the rest of it, I just wanted handsome boys and cute girls to fight with. The graphics are great it's just wants to milk me of my money and I HAVE NONE!! Make the money to in game currency less on the real amount and more in game, and then will see if you get any.",2
Controls take some getting used to and get get you stuck at times but the story keeps me entertained,5
Great mobile game. Must try RPG,5
The loading screen made me wait 3 hours than it crashed bad game dont get.,1
I think that this should be made into an anime series on either crunchyroll or funimation but not with the small versions of the characters but with the teenage models,5
Downloads are a little long but the game is very cute and charming! Fun characters with interesting backgrounds!,4
Great it's graphics are amazing just wow love it keep it up oh and add more characters it would be cool,5
"Could do better on the freemium front. Despite the free currency, it comes slow and in small amounts that make pulls less enjoyable and infrequent. Despite that the controls are good, i feel there should be an option to change the size of the movement arrow, since it does tend to get in the way sometimes, and maybe even allow for attacking during movement, since the transition from moving to combat is a bit jarring in my opinion.",4
"The game is fun to play, the graphics and designs are good. To top it off it's an actual RPG",5
I like the cut scenes and the graphics are great I'm really glad I downloaded this game keep it up I'll keep supporting,4
I like durgens,4
I love the music and gameplay. Definitely worth downloading. I will say it's a plus because of Nintendo.,5
Kamu harus coba game ini,4
Very good but the controls were kind of weird to me but overall a good game keep it up!,4
C'mon. It's Nintendo. Nintendo made this. It's great.,5
Graphics are great!,5
Music is so good,5
"In Dragalia, there is true respect for the dragon.",5
Awesome game so far. Really good,5
Having fun,5
Love the gameplay so far a great story. And the characters look really cute,5
I like it it is fun and has a great syory,5
I think it's a good rpg,5
Fun,5
good game with great song!,5
Game refuses to connect to the server,1
ok,5
<3 Daoko,5
"Takes up too much space and isn't a very fun gacha game. Controls are pretty stupid. Its overall an okay game, but i wouldnt reccomend it.",3
Love it,5
Pretty good similar to Grand Summoners,5
"A leveling game for kids with expensive micro-transactions. Same gatcha system as many other games - basically highway robbery with little reward. Nice graphics and music, though.",4
The controls are a bit wonky but other than that it's probably the most fun mobage I've played,4
Awesome,5
It's good,5
So far so good! Hopefully not a pay to play coming ahead...,5
Love it,4
Awesome game love it not sure why people are hating on its perfect,5
you made one of the hooks of the story too obvious. right off the bat it's in your face and you can guess where it goes. along with the fact that you have to download two large chunks separately rather than before you begin the game is a let down. get it all out of the way and let us play without waiting for a gig to download after an initial download. from what sliver of gameplay I saw it has a unique style that I did enjoy.,3
"Pretty fun for a gacta game, just wish the gacta system was a bit better lol",4
"""Great! It's a modernized classic in my eyes, like a 20th century version of D&D with chibis!""",5
Old time memorys on this style game,4
"From the soundtrack to the controls, this game is fun, easy to enjoy story, and all around well made.",5
It's a great game that doesn't force you to pay to level. Music is nice too.,5
Decent distraction. Standard jrpg story. Neat,4
Best game of 2018,5
Good game,5
This game is great... Can see me playing for quite a bit,4
I love the game so far,5
gg,5
It's a really fun game,5
Reminds me of breath of fire good job nintendo,5
Amazing!,5
I won't even let me start the game and freezes. I can't even play it. :(,1
I love this game because it's fun playing Anime RPG games so try this game out guy's :),5
Both fun and active,5
Game is pretty good but controls are touchy even after setting sensitivity to lowest Like most mobile games microtransactions and can be expensive. Think game would also be better in side veiw instead of vertically. But all so far decent.,4
This game is awesome and so easy to play love it!!!!!,5
"This game is really fun. The story is good and gameplay isnt too bad. However, the pull rates are HORRIBLE for this game. I've already pulled 70 times and haven't gotten any good units.",4
I personally wouldve rather played this game on landscape rather than portrait controls but it's no big deal at all considering how fun the game is :),5
Amazing I love this game,5
"Pretty much anything Nintendo is pretty thought out and fun, great for people of all ages and easy enough for everyone to enjoy.",5
It's like puzzles and dragons or summoners war but you actually have to play,5
The game has a serious bug issue that freezes the phone and forces me to restart my phone,1
Great story that has a chance to be awesome and memorable controls are alittle wonky,5
Great graphics love the way this was put together and made.,5
It is so much fun!!!!!! 😎,5
Me like,5
So far so good but control-wise its a bit hard,5
Game is fun. It's a giant grindfest. But enough content to keep you busy.,4
Fun times,5
Adventure,5
Great game lots to do and read,5
Pretty fun game however I wonder why Nintendo doesn't team up which FUNimation or another great anime maker and turn this into an anime because I would totally watch it.,5
It's awesome,5
Best of the best,5
Pretty cool beans man.,5
I think this is a game really worth playing and it's actually very fine For once I find a game on the phone I like to play,5
"Once again I'm loving this game soo much thank you for fully creating a game where I can truly connect to the charaters and their situations, almost feels like I'm watching and playing a anime/game. 5/5",5
Fun fun fun,5
Awesome game,5
Dun,4
Very fun,5
Nintendo and cygames team up to make a game about dragons. Sign me up!,5
Dam chibi game of awesome.. it's a good game I have really been enjoying myself with it. Wish I could play it on my switch.,5
"Very Fun Game, Super cool Characters.",5
"The game is great. my phone is too slow, but thats on my part",5
Great gameplay and music,5
"It's a fun game, but having to load the map each time you try to do the Quest makes it take so much time and battery life",4
Yea,5
great story mode. controls are tricky but overall great,5
I like the game so far,5
It was good,3
Been playing the game for a while and I'm enjoying every minute of it. Hasn't felt like it was trying to force me to spend money at all. Only issue I'm having with it is trying to use force strikes whenever I need.,5
Huge initial download. Then there is a download every level..annoying. then there are 700 dialog boxes to click constantly. Are you sure...continue.. progress...cancel...accept... EVERYTHING requires you click some pointless dialog box. You spend more time clicking pointless boxes and downloading every 5 seconds then you spend playing the ridiculously short levels. Which by the way the controls suck. And why is this simple app like 2 gigs?,3
Pretty fun,5
"I'm so tired of these overly elaborate RPGs that require gigabytes of space, and only download incrementally. I download the original game, then I have to download another 0.5gb after I open it just to play the intro. Then after less than 10 minutes of gameplay, I need to download another 0.9gb! So stupid.",1
So far so good just started but seems fantastic,5
"Dragalia Lost is the best gacha-game ever made bar none. AAA quality and a lot of fun, just don't go in with a completionist mindset because it will NEVER happen.",5
Quality combat & updates Olive this game.,4
Litty,5
"Beyond a great game. I don't understand why it would be rated so low by so many, its gacha is fair and events are fun.",5
"So far this is a really cool game, keeps me very interested in the entire story line and what's gonna happen next in the game. But I. Still in the first 3 levels and can't wait to keep playing and getting more dragons. I love this game",5
This is a beautiful game done with modern mobile RPG aspects. This is probably the only mobile game I hate playing with the sound off.,5
Fun gacha game. Please let me predownload levels.,4
"Its a good game but I'm not sure why the 3d characters are like shadow and the monsters/enemies/ dragons are like shadows too. The add shows the characters visible but I don't see them. Other than that, its fun.",4
Update: lot of issues and to think they have just started this. At first they are quick with resolving issues but now they seem to be nowhere only focusing in dragalia life comics. Hard to trigger force strike. AI sucks!!! Could have been a solo game than a team with super dumb AI. Original: AWESOME!!! HOPING FOR MORE HEROES AND INCREASE DROP RATES FOR 5 STAR HEROES!!!!!,1
"Its too short of levels, over heats my phone downloading all the time, just needs to download all at once because it takes too long to play and download screen is repetitive. Overall great game just needs some buffering and it could be better.",3
Very addictive. Game very nice congratulations one gold medal for this game,5
Good,5
Would be fun but the controls are trash,3
wyrmprints galore.,3
Good,5
The story is not amazing but it is pretty good and different for a game coming from Nintendo. The gacha itself is somewhere between FE heros and FGO in that while it offers summons in groups of 10 and requires a bit more resources there's also more opportunities to gain resources and better odds at good pulls and I quite like it. the grind for resources is made that much more manageable by the gameplay which if very unique for a gacha game and can even be said to be pretty fun if not hindered by mobile controls. Overall solid game and great gacha.,4
"Gacha is disgusting. Everything thrown in 1 gacha? Seperating them into 3 parts would've been better, free daily pulls, if not put 30 days like other games and get a 10 summon ticket instead of 10 days 1 summon ticket. Very bad idea to do this kind of gacha and login.",2
"One of the most enjoyable mobile games I've ever played. Engaging gameplay, cute and fun graphics and rewarding multiplayer. The controls can take a bit to get used to, but after practice I've found that skill trumps money or lucky pulls in this game, which is refreshing to see. Highly recommend this game for any action RPG fans.",5
Damn these dragons are really hot,5
I can't play it because it keeps on saying authentication not working and can't process email me so i can try play it,3
Loving it so far catch a rates for me have either been lucky or there decent with the multi summon.,5
Is very good,5
Too much downloading.,3
The out of game menus could be simplified and an option to play horizontally would be cool,5
No! Nintento why did you have to switch to anime?,3
It's a pretty fun game,5
Amazeballs,5
I love it the graphics the story they're all nice,4
fantastic game with great storylines,5
"Wouldn't even open after installation, just an endless white screen. Would love to try it if I could.",1
This is actually a very impressive game for a mobile.,4
Fun!,5
I love the story. The gameplay is good. It does take a bit to understand what everything does. But it is fun and I enjoy playing it everyday.,5
Love love loved it,5
Awesome co-op. I recommend,5
"This game is great, I was searching for a game to play after I beat all the zenonia games and I found this, it's very similar but very different too. I guarantee you'll love it!!!",5
Really cool,5
This I hands down the most free to play friendly gatcha game I've ever played. It's so much fun and rewards you around every corner,5
Didn't think I would like this game as much as I do but I can't stop playing! Great to fit in a few minutes of awesome action!,5
Game stop working over a month ago. Emailed dev and received no help.this how you treat those who trying to show you support?,1
"First and foremost, any game that says it's only a few megs, then has a ton of downloads after is dishonest garbage. So not only is there a gig and a half of program, it says it's on your external, but it isn't. That's a gig and a half that had to be on my phone, and I bought a nice memory card so I wouldn't have to deal with that garbage. So Instant one star for that dumb run around, but second the controls are so awful you spend more time hitting nothing than monsters, not to mention the only okay graphics. All and all, I love Nintendo, but this is beyond not worth anyone's time. Step up your game Nintendo, you're better than this.",1
Literally the best mobile game currently available. My boyfriend and I constantly look for fun games to play together while we're away from each other and we stopped looking for new ones when we got this game. The story is amazing and makes me cry and laugh and exhale sharply from my nose. Characters are fleshed out. There's so much to do. It's close to perfect.,5
I have been playing this game for 5 days now. And this game is AMAZING! I LOVE THE MUSIC I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME ITS MY NEW FAV GAME! =D,5
Great style fun to play,5
Great,5
Nintendo did a awsome job on this mobile game,5
"The game is decent for your typical gacha-type. Fun to be had if you pay for it. Otherwise, it's a tough grind. Don't expect to play very deep into the story without sinking $$ into the game, however. Gameplay is on the average side, and graphics are pretty good if your phone has the power behind it. The music and English/Japanese voice actors are solid in their performances, as expected from a Nintendo-branded title. The serious gripes I have are the mindless friendly A.I. on the solo side. They die way too easily/frequently even on challenges where your might matches the minimum requirements. That needs some serious remedy asap, and Controls need some fine tuning. Every time I go in for a shield-break, and I try to tap on my character to charge, the game takes it as I'm moving my character. That's what I've got so far out of the week I've played. Perhaps my views will change for the positive the deeper I delve, or perhaps they'll just aggravate me all the more. Time will tell.",3
Besides some out of sync voicelines and cut scenes this is an awesome game,5
"Very good, Needs a Update now and then but very good.",5
👌,5
Awesome,5
This game is berry good only thing is the weird questions if this game is first person or submarine game,5
A really well made game!!! Despite its looks its also easy on your battery!!!,5
It's definately eye catching of I had a better phone I'm sure I'd get 100% out of it but even at 50% I enjoy playing it. Looking forward tho the story.,4
By far one of the best mobile games i have ever played love it would recommend it,5
Captivating,4
This game is the best mobile game I ever played. It takes up a ton of storage but it's well worth it.,5
The game has easy controls and is fun and addictive even if you don't log into the game you still get rewards.,5
"I think it's pretty straight forward, easy to grasp and stunning graphics:D well done",4
Awesome game. Host needs to be able to kick players from co-op,5
Love it but there are some annoying problems. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5,5
It's a good rpg,5
Mmm bad controls....,4
This is the best game I have played in a long time and while it has many of the same features of most other mobile games it still feels like a high quality Nintendo game!,5
To much download,1
It could handle better but it's by far the best mobile rpg with summons,5
Great,5
"Amazing game. The controls are a little weird, but overall really good. Glad to see you fixed the Co-op bug, and as promised here are your 5 stars. I hope to see more great things from you Nintendo, and Cygames as well.",5
Very addictive.,5
"Despite the horrible odds for pulling a 5 star, it's still a good game, any unit can become very good with enough investment, however my biggest complaint are some of the controls, specifically force strike, they should make them into an ability with a 1 sec cooldown instead of an unusable gimmick. Once they change the force strike issue my rating will increase.",3
This is my first time playing this game and I already enjoy it I think it's addicting,5
Amazing!,5
Been playing since launch great gameplay and events,5
Great game! Super fun and interesting. Simple easy controls and interface.,5
Dope,5
Great game good job guys,5
Like it so far,4
I love this,5
AWESOME!!!!!!!,5
The gatcha system sucks but other than that great game.,4
A great game with a great story. It's fun and doesn't cost anything,5
"Is good game, but the batch download makes it impossible to make a video on it.",3
"Some of the worst rates in any gacha game I've ever seen. Not to mention the wyrmprints rates are higher than the actual dragons or characters, that's bs. The game play is fun but when you have terrible rates like this where you spend 10k + wyrmite and all you get is one wyrmprint, that's just bs.",3
Game is awesome so far! Dont know why people are complaining about the low gatcha rates when the game gives you a ton of free in game currency. Good job guys!,5
"Fun game interesting controls, cool that you can control all your characters",4
Great game,5
Awsome,5
Everyone needs to rememeber that this game JUST came out and is still in beta. It's going to consistently update to fix any errors or add new things. Don't have such jigh expectations already and just enjoy the game as it can have potential.,5
Great game i LOVE IT.,5
It's cool. Could get repetitive.,3
Fun,4
"This game is great so far. Not a huge rush to spend real money. You can advance just the same without. Only downside is I can see where it would become ""easier"" if you do spend money when you start getting into the mid-20s and low 30s. Probably just amplifies from there. Overall though, this is a great game and solid entry from Nintendo for the mobile platform.",4
the hell are you? reading this review,5
"If you had played ""white cat Project"", this game is equal or better than that one. Truly amazing. Best RPG quality.",5
Very fun and exciting game.,5
It is a great game it has good graphics and good game play,5
Great graphics and gameplay that won't instantly drain your battery. You can even adjust graphics to save battery. Some of the controls are clumsy but the rpg is a great game on the go with lots to do without feeling too repetitive.,5
"Your team AI will be the biggest hurdle to surviving events as you watch them stand in place doing 0 damage but taking all the enimies hits. The events (Halloween currently) are also unbalanced and seemingly cater to those who can devote their time to the game 24/7 and have very good luck on summoning a 5 -star unit, dragon, AND wyrmprint. Also pray you have a team of the appropriate element for the event or watch the AI teammates evaporate round one. It is for the reasons that AI can't fight and the high bar set by developer for ""clearing"" makes even paying in to the game is not worth the insane in-game currency pricing.",1
"Wonderful visuals, loveable characters and an enjoyable story. Great work!",5
Awesome,5
So many updates,2
It Is a mobile game,5
I don't know why I wanted to play this being is I don't like anime art style. But I gave it a try anyways only to get to the title screen and it saying it can't connect to server.,1
Its real fun. I think it'd be a lot more fun if you could constantly run around to different missions and around the town to different shops to do upgrading and summoning. But hey maybe in the future. Great stuff,4
"Everything about this game is awesome. It's a gacha game to its core, but it's one of the most FREE, Freemium game I've ever played and I've played them all. The rates for rare characters are gonna be different for everybody, but that doesn't mean that should affect your enjoyment. All the characters are either very adorable or freakin' rad! And there's so many game play mechanics, sure the movement isn't great, but when it does work, it's incredibly smooth. All that and more keeps me coming back for more, even if I didn't get my Halloween Silke.",5
Very cute and enjoyable!!,5
I love dragons,5
A typical gacha game with bland overly simplistic arpg gameplay.,3
Greatest visuals and sound I've seen in a long while. Controls are mostly horrible tho!,4
Fun and exciting story is very interesting as well cant wait to play more and more,5
Good,5
Breath taking!,5
Nice game but drains your data and battery life.,4
thanks everyone,4
To those complaing about the constant updates Go to the More Icom then Options and under the System tab scroll to the Bottom and Hit Batch download. It'll download everything in the game(Minus any new events or maintence updates.) If you always can't join rooms or lobbies TURN OFF Your Power save options for some reason this prevents joining rooms and playing with others. Hope this troubleshoot helps.,5
It as some good game play,5
Great!,5
Great jrpg classic gameplay,5
love the game story awesome and fun,5
Love it,5
Great so far.,5
Great game,5
I think this a great game simple controls fun gameplay and great graphics,5
Really fun great story kinda hard combat controls u have to get use to but otherwise its a good time killer,5
Best game of my life,5
The game needs more gameplay and less story elements or the story needs to be implemented in the gameplay. It's slow and i need another option for controls. The current controls are horrible and not responsive as should be. Needs another control option in menu to make game playable.,2
IIt'd It's a cool game it's like a 3d arcade game,5
It's a well made app game. Kinda generic with the stamina and such however,4
"Great game, definitely feels like a full game compared to your typical phone game.",5
"Very fun! Every new character you obtain has their own story, so it's very engaging. Quality game as expected from Nintendo.",5
I love the story it is very good even the events that go on are well written. I also really enjoy the gameplay.,5
Love this game.,5
In short the game is great im not to big a fan of how the plot is broken up from the game play but then again a lott of mobil games are the same way all in all i find it verry enjoyable definetly worth the download,5
Super well done,5
"Addictive and fun. Great graphics, stunning visuals, I highly recommend this game to rpg players.",5
"Very great mobile game from Nintendo. I like how the story is going & the visuals, art & music are very nice & cheerful.",5
"Fun game to grind, reminds me of Fate:GO",5
Nice n simple tap n slash quest,5
"Fun, online only though",4
Very good graphics and gameplay even if you don't get 5 star char acters that often it's still fun to play,5
Good easy to get into,5
Generic.,1
You have this game perfect good job I love dragalia lost.,5
Great game. Another solid Nintendo title.,5
Amazing graphics,5
Cool game.,4
It was great,5
Horrible summon rate,1
"My phone sucks, but the game is pretty good",4
Only just starting,4
OST is the best by far. That's the reason I kept playing Tbh,5
What a sorry excuse of a game nintendo....get with the times already.,1
"Beautiful art, interesting story, simple controls and fun as heck",5
Great game.,5
Nice,5
A lot of glitches,3
"Love the storyline, gameplay, and graphics, but it is a massive game. Very smooth at first, then started freezing too much to enjoy.",4
"Great game, although the controls are pretty bad. I've been playing it ever since I installed it and I love it.",5
I would rate this higher if this game would stop closing on me! I'm using a 6.0 on the lowest settings. THE GAME SHOULD NOT BE CLOSING ON ME WITH THOSE SETTINGS!,2
It's fun but there are a lot of downloads,4
The game is so fun,5
Good,5
A real good story,5
It's great,5
"Dragalia Lost is such a great game. And is what I look for in a RPG. Customization to combat. There's different ways you can customize your adventures to fit your needs for battles. Even though characters can be three star rarity, they can still be viable. You don't need to have a five star rarity to do events or do high end content. Battles take skill and that's what I like about this game. I've been enjoying playing it with family and friends",5
This game is amazing the graphics the gameplay everything my only issues are the Summoning odds for getting gud hero's is bad and the story is short on easy mode,5
I love this game,5
I hated having to unistall this awesome game. It was just too big,5
The music and art is amazing! There is a high level of polish going on here. Story is the only thing dragging it down.,5
"Great game, I will definitely recommend it to my friends",4
Moving the character around can be difficult.,3
A great game with the coolness of dragons!,5
Good,5
"Fun game, but it was irritating how many times I had to download stuff to play. They should really just make everything else download in one go.",4
"Terrible gacha rates, polluted pools with wyrm prints that rob you of your pity rates. Cost to roll is more expensive than other mobages. Avoid this at all cost, probably one of Cygames' worst games. DAOKO is dope though.",1
Summoning for people always fails me but great game play,3
I don't like it...I LOVE IT!!!!!$$,5
"The story and plot are really good and driven, the music choice for a final boss like when you meet the dragon could be a bit improved and if the other/future timeline younger sisister could be bit more dressed up but overall the game has amazing grafics and the character story and introduction are also great. 🌸",5
Excellent graphics and music. The gameplay is also super polished,5
"I love this game it's got an awesome story, fun game play, great characters And the music is absolutely amazing! way to go Nintendo!",5
"Is a good game, has a lot of things to do and there are events that will help you when you first play the game.",5
"Too much downloaded content also, the story to game play ratio is really one sided towards story context",5
"Pretty cool game, graphics are good, good music. So far, so good",5
"This game is really fun and very enjoyable, the 5* star rates aren't high, as per usual with gacha games, but I assure you it's not IMPOSSIBLE like these nitpicky 1* review imply, they just have bad luck and are upset. There are a lot of ways to get Wyrmite, and a lot of ways to use Wyrmite early on. This game is solid, and has potential to get even better.",5
Graphics and voice acting are great. One of the most engaging stories I've ever seen in a mobile game.,5
Nintendo always does a great job I just say I'm enjoying this great game ^_^,5
Great game to just play for hours. It's simple enough to keep me entertained.,4
Awesome,5
I think it's a great game. It's got great rhythm to it and a nice story. My only complaint is the movement controls. I would be a lot happier with a joystick control or a tap to move control rather than the slide from anywhere on the screen. Other than that it's a fantastic game.,4
"Gotta give it to Nintendo to create a pretty dope rpg, it really makes me think of Square Enix. Love the visuals, the music, the controls,(so far it doesn't seem to be an autoplay game). You guys got it right, if you love jrpgs, snatch this game up.",5
"Fun, good story, great voice acting and good graphics.",5
very goot,5
This sum gud quality,5
"Good game, pretty fun, and plays pretty well for a moble game. Nintindo has done it again !!!",5
"It's just a lot of reading and not much playing. It's better than Nintendos other games, but it isn't amazing.",3
Another great Nintendo Mobile game. Really enjoying it so far.,5
Greatest Nintendo 🎮 on the Phone,5
It looks amazing because it's from an amazing company (my favorite company). Hopefully it isn't p2w like other mobile games but it looks really fun.,5
"Interesting controls, great music, catchy noises and an interesting story. I can't wait to get a little more into it",5
Soo cute game thank you so much nintendo,5
Good for passing the time,5
Tr,5
Very reminiscent of DS RPGs in both visual style and story.,5
Wonderful game it's a must have,5
A great cute new Nintendo ip with a really interesting story and actual gameplay worth getting into,5
I love this game,5
It's a very great and amazing game!,5
It's fine. Too repetitive for me though.,3
Pretty decent.,4
It's very fun I enjoy it,5
Fun so far I'll will update review once I've played some more,5
"The game is great, but I want more damage skills for each class character.",5
Great game! Very free to play from what I've seen.,5
"I wanted to like this game. Graphically it is a beautiful game, a lot of depth; but it's way to complicated to pick up and go. Far to difficult to level up and power up your characters. Hopefully they make some changes, possibly ease up on the ""grind"" aspect of the game so it's actually fun to play. I know that I have to grind to level up and progress in the game, but it's discouraging and to the point where I don't even want to play.",3
"Charming! This game is bright and colorful, with nice music. The battles are quick and fun, and the voice acting makes the characters enjoyable as well. The game's large file size can be intimidating, but it isn't a big inconvenience.",5
Great game fun fluid game play,5
Amazing must play. Just wish the characters wouldn't run so fast controls need to be adjusted more. But this game is so far the best mobile game I played in a very long time.,5
Simple RPG that's surprisingly charming.,5
Not bad considering it being a phone game I like it!!,5
"Genuinely my favorite mobile game. Adorable models, fun yet easy to understand gameplay, and lovable and unforgettable characters.",5
Yeeeeees,5
"Good gacha fun, under Nintendo I'm confident they won't get absurd",5
The game was very fun and fast paced. The graphics were good and the story was great. Only uninstalling because it takes up two and a half gigs of space that I dont have,5
"Developers very responsive about improving the game and sending out free stuff to apologize for the smallest slight. Why does this game have a poor rating? I've progressed well in pace with the content, entirely free to play to boot.",5
Very cute and fun!,5
So far so good,5
Really fun have and is not pay2win! Combat is challenging and fun. Units are balanced. Great game so far with lots of content!,5
Fun game!,5
"Intentionally bottlenecks rupies and other resources mid to late game to try and frustrate the player into dropping more dolla dolla bills, and that's if you're willing to ignore the terrible gacha rates long enough to get that far. I've never played a gacha game that felt this predatory before.",1
So great game great graffics but the players ai for every character but the one you control is horrible like healers don't heal if you control a long range attacker all short ranged wont attack vice versa once this is fixed it'll become a brilliant game,4
Games overall pretty good but I feel like the summons are to expensive,5
Really fun and very addictive,5
This game has beautiful graphics and it's fun to play \(≧▽≦)/,5
"Okay. This game is great. There's only one drawback, which is the downloads. I waited a good 5 minutes to download, completed the tutorial, and then another download started. I'm uninstalling this app until this is more manageable.",3
So much fun. Bravo Nintendo,5
It's really repetitive with all the dialogue at the beginning. But other than that it would make a good game. This is just my opinion of it,2
"Cute designs, gameplay has improved and also event types are varied",5
"One of the best mobile games I have played. Even beats out some non mobile games. Great characters, music, and tons of hours of fun and nearly every level is multiplayer. What's not to like?",5
The game is pretty good but the controls could be better besides that everything else is goid,4
"It's a good game, the controls are a little wobbly, but overall it's a fun game.",4
Yay good Nintendo game on the phone,5
"I love this game no, I FREAKING love this game even though its in chibi style the gameplay while boring at first becomes smooth like butter. Its NOT like fire emblem heroes where's its a cash grab gaming whaler of a game and summoning characters require a hard to obtain set of a certain item to get them, it's frequent and never needs to go on a grind fest to obtain it and us there is no summoning the same character and deciding which one has better stats. The soundtrack is fantastic and isn't easily forgettable. It actually has a good currency system unlike most mobile game that come easily through quest along with the items needed to summoning characters. It unlike heroes DOESN'T have fanservice and be a ""sex sells"" kind of game HOWEVER, my fear because of what heroes has become I fear it will do fanservice and ruin the whole theme of the whole game. I highly recommend downloading it and give it a shot.",5
Great,4
It's okay.,3
"The animation is slow, there's need to be an auto battle botton, and the touch move thing is difficult to move around because the axis keep moveing around. Please fix. Other wise fun game.",4
The battle system is simple and easy. Really Enjoy the Game.,4
"Solid game all around, but the touch controls can be a bit clumsy.",4
Very nice game,5
Its aight.,5
Great game,5
Cool,5
I love it. Not the controls,4
This is one of the only action fighting games ive enjoyed so far . fantastic soundtrack as well.,5
"Fun gameplay, great graphics!",5
Boring. Gameplay is not good or deep enough to excuse how extremely grindy it is. Thought it would be different because Nintendo is involved but it is very generic.,1
It's just very good & fun.,5
"Great game, great so far! I'm just hoping it doesn't become a pay-to-win game further in",5
It every good,5
It's a reley good game 👍,5
Tells me to update. Doesnt let me update.,1
I think it is the best,5
Top notch.,5
"Good story line and graphics, but AI desperately needs a work on. Enemies during events needs to be re-tuned so that they do not constantly spam skills.",3
Best mobile game I've played in a while! I'm hooked,5
Its cool,5
Great to see Nintendo pump out another great story driven gem for mobile ^~^,5
Love this hero collector awesome stuff,5
Cartoonish diablo on the go. Perfect,5
Amazing Game. I love it all. The story and characters are amazing and the gameplay is great. Definitely going on my favorites list.,5
Its fun and if you dont have sweaty hands you should have fun,5
Great JRP especially for mobile. Long cut scenes but you can skip and get summary. English voice would be nice,5
I loved it I only have a few things to say one there should be Clans or guilds and an in-game chat number two you need to make it to where the whole game downloads when you first open it and 3 find something better to do with the controls thank you and I am loving what you're doing,5
Afuego,5
great game,5
Coolest Nintendo mobile game yet!!!,5
Love the game but I don't like all the downloads,4
"Amazing graphics, fun gameplay, but the controls... Dear lord they are garbage Please just add a virtual d pad and buttons.",3
Don't have to much time in the game but I can see myself grinding quite a bit!,4
Amazing in gameplay and animation.,5
"Horrible controls, unresponsive movement. Avoid it and save your money.",1
Fun,5
Absolutely Amazing !!! Must Play !!!,5
"Controls are a little weird. But it's super fun, super anime. I've done 30 premium draws and I haven't even spent any money, I'm only level 2 also. It's just a great cool game where you get to turn into huge ""dragons"" like I got a dragon that was a giant pumpkin girl. Overall great game.",5
Yay,5
Really enjoyed the variety of summons well done,5
"This game is fantastic for a mobile app game., it actual feels like a handheld game and not just a gotcha grab. Highly recommend and has a interesting story. And free to play friendly 5 stars",5
"I've been anticipating this game since the trailers, and I'm happy to say it lives up to the expectations and more.",5
Great,5
"To crowded on most of the different menus, looks promising but clean up these screens, less clutter.",3
Great story with great characters but the controls need a little work. Still a good good all around,4
Wonderful,5
Its fun play in Wi-Fi and your fine! Super fun!!,5
Breath taking,5
Nice game good time sink and Interesting graphics,4
"Lots of fun, Plays great",5
Good.,4
"Overall very good. BUT, cannot see the characters in battle, just silhouettes. Cannot see the in cut scenes, only silhouettes. That's not good. At all. I hope to see this issue resolved in a timely manner.",4
Great story and music I feel that the models are very well thought out as well.,5
I love it ❤❤❤💗,5
Good game Good game,4
Controls are a little strange but other then that it's nice,5
Is good,4
Its badass!!!,5
Great game with good story and simple easy to control buttons. You can pay for higher chances of better characters but you can also get great character for free by grinding through the story it overall amazong amd perfect for a touch screen phone with attacks and ablilities to turn to a dragon. It is great,5
"Fun game, great music, doesn't beat you over the head with paying for currency. It has low gacha rates but that hasn't bothered me. All around a fun and very polished game, but be warned, this game is absolutely massive. I think it's about 4 gigs. I recommend you go to the setting and hit download all if you don't want to keep downloading it piece by piece.",4
like this game but some time it will jump out the game back to android front page... please fix,4
"Great music and smooth combat.voice work is great.only downside is that it's huge,but it's to be expected with a game that has this much polish.",5
This game is amazing,5
I'm really enjoying playing this.,5
Don't expect to be able to set your name as anything reflecting European heritage. Gotta hate whitey right?,1
Pls maks more stories in this game and content this game is so good inwant tonplag more of it,5
Great game,5
Great game but dem gacha rates,5
"Love love love this game! The voice acting is fantastic, the art style is superb, the music soundtrack is great and the play through is addicting.",5
Real darn good,5
Not bad can really see it was made by professionals.,5
Dragons 🐲,4
"Great graphics and 3D outlines, I love the story line",5
I wished the game download everything instead having to download part by part,4
Kind of a rip off of Sword Art Online Memory Defrag,3
"Everything about this game is good (good music, art, story)... except the gameplay and controls. Wanted to love it, but sadly couldn't keep playing due to the janky control system and boring gameplay.",2
"This reminds me of how I felt when I first started playing Fire Emblem way back in the day. The characters, the story, the dialogue: it's entrancing.",5
"Cute characters, easy controls and pick up and play ability. Would recommend to any RPG or anime fans without hesitation.",5
Fun!,5
Idk,5
GREAT GAME!!!,5
This game is fun and has adorable characters and is addictive,5
The game was awesome and it had really good graphics,5
"The only reason I deleted this is because it had too many additional data to download, but otherwise a good game! I would totally buy it if it was ported onto the switch or 3DS",5
Make more like this,5
I love dragons,5
"Wow, not only are the summon rates absolute garbage, the ""rewards"" they give you are a complete joke. One month of playing, ZERO five star characters. One month ""reward"" was a SINGLE SUMMON voucher that gave me a useless obtainable item. You don't need to implement bug fixes for this game, you need to stop being such stingy developers. Don't bother with this one ugh",1
"It's a great game overall it's good, the graphics are good the gameplay is great just the best game I have on mobile!",5
Very fun. Love Cygames and grindy games so this is definitely fun.,5
Really thought this was gonna be a terrible game but I was proven wrong it might take to much space but it's worth every last MGB!,5
It's amazing,5
"Cute chibi sprite, fun gameplay, catchy daoko ost. Good gaming experience overall. Rating 1 star cause of low gacha rate is just for weaklings",5
"Pretty amazing honestly, the only turn off is the touch/slide controls, but it took some time to get used to after a few chapters.",4
One of the best mobile games Nintendo ever put out!,5
the pumpking music tho,5
"So far so good. Love the sound track and the gameplay. Not usually a fan of mobile games, but this one showed promise. Glad to be correct, so far.",4
Fun time so far; loving controls and gameplay. RMT doesn't feel too invasive either,5
"The cutscenes during each quest are quite laggy, but the rest of the game is fun.",4
I really liked the story and the gameplay but it really sucked how much storage the game needed. It went up to 3 gigabytes so i had to delete it because I couldnt update or take pictures.,4
"Solid game. Next to no real problems. They even improved the controls in about a week after release. Looking good so far, looking forward to future content.",5
this game is great i hate toxic people who make the rating on good games low because of stupid things give it a try i love it !!!,5
"I truly love this game. Had an issue with not being able to use my home wifi, so i had to use my cellular network. And it helps to know you can batch download the whole game by going to options- system- scroll all the way down.",5
Honestly love the story /characters in the game. With an outstanding soundtrack. As a gacha game though the rates for summoning are really low and leveling up characters/other items becomes a grindfest sometimes. Even the some quests become grinding for the exclusive item for that event. Though I still enjoy the game either way. I do wish those get improved in a later update.,5
I love this role play game its the best I've play in a long time keep up the good work Nintendo!!!,5
I like it just make it a pine time download.... Its annoying having to download each level,5
Impressive just not liking download b4 every board,4
Great game! Controls are a bit tricky but I love the gameplay!,5
It's awesome,5
Love it,5
It is amazing I love games like this and for it to have English voices in it makes me even happier not to mention the story is getting good and lots of stuff to do my 1 and only complaint is that we need to get more Rewards to use the summon gate and also there needs to be a increase in the chance to get better things the drop rate for 4 star and above gear is just to low and I think if you made the required materials needed to summon or increase the drops chances for 4 and 5 star gear the game would be a lot better,5
This game is so cool but i have one little problem it lags sometimes here and there and the controls are hard to use can you maybe try to make it less sensitive,5
Fantastic Game. One of the best tutorials I've gone through. And skipping scenes gives you a summary first. They really made a great experience for the player.,5
It's a great game.,5
Great game,5
"Knights, Dragons,rpg? Everything I wanted in a game I only wish it was on consol",5
It's alright so far. Movement could use a little work.,4
The game is very fun I enjoy every minute of it great work to whoever made this game.....,5
Needs landscaoe mode a the game will be perfect.,5
Very fun and graphics are really good,5
Fun at first but becomes a money grab rather fast. I would rather pay $10 for a full unlocked game then this micro transaction game.,1
So far so good!,5
Great music and ridiculous amount of charm. Would be 5 stars if they got the monetization right - everything costs about twice as much as seems reasonable.,4
Awesome,5
Super,5
The game is pretty cool actually. Fun combos.,5
"Very cute game, I love the chibi. It's very laggy in most parts, but I'm sure that'll be fixed later down the line. I wish moving around weren't so tricky. Other than that, cute casual fantasy game with wonderful Dragon designs.",4
I think it is a very cute mobile game.,5
Its fun,4
"The game doesn't deserve all the hate its getting, its a really decent and enjoyable game. I just have have a few problems with it. First is the fact that I have to download everytime I go into a new chapter. I bothersome since I sometimes play it away from my WiFi and even though the download size is small, I still have to wait some time to play it, not really mobile friendly. Second is the gacha rate for 5 stars, I've been getting nothing but 5 star Wyrmprints and its kinda frustrating. I'd rather have them separate or something since I'd rather get a new character that a Wyrmprint. I love the game though and I hope that these problems can be fixed.",4
Ok,5
It's so fun I can't stop playing!,5
"I don't get why the game gets so much flack. It's very well done, and super fun!",5
It always freezes on me.,3
"It feels like all the other Cygames you know and not a nintendo game. ""If it's not fun, why bother?"" Reggie Fils-Aimé.",3
"If anybody noticed, this was also made by the same group that made grand blue fantasy and the main character's physical bodies are similar along with the sword.",4
This has been a good time waster and the music is awesome. Well worth the time.,5
"What a wonderfully colorful, cute game with actual gameplay and a interesting shonen-esque story.",5
This is a funny and awesome game with a great storyline and action sequences!😎👍,5
The game's nothing special,3
Lit,5
Gameplay is amazing,5
Awesome game I love RPGS and Nintendo So I downloaded it right away my onlycomplaint is that it controls a bit weird,5
Great Graphics and fun to play,5
Best game I have ever played,5
If this was made by Nintendo they did a really good job,5
fun,4
"Minus downloading every quest, there is a lot in this free game of Nintendo to enjoy.",4
The required in-game resources to obtain heroes or level them up is atrocious. So little reward for too much effort. I feel like I am working instead of being entertained.,3
Great RPG very addictive,5
"Beautiful design, super awesome music, super addicting. Ppl need to stop crying about lowrates. Yes rates are low but me and my gf been playing less then 5 days and we both got 2× 5* dragon and adventurers. GAME IS AWESOME WITH REAL TIME CO OP AND RAIDS.",5
"Fun art style, cool characters, and all around fun.",5
Great game,5
The best in the entire universe keeping making more I beg you 😫game developer,5
I love Nintendo this game is great.,5
Good game love the music,5
"Very nice graphics, not exactly the kind of game I thought it would be, but it's overall a good game",4
A great storyline,5
"More story than game, but you can skip it if that's not your thing. Refreshing for a phone game!",5
Thank you for fixing. Gave it 5* and it's a fun addictive game,5
Its really good,4
"Very cute models with some decent comedic writing, along with a good deal of detail in every character through Stories. Good job.",5
Best game ever played,5
Great cute rpg,5
Sweet game,5
I didnt get a 5 star so I am mad,3
It won't let me play,1
I love the graphics,5
Very good,5
Super intuitive but energy is a huge problem after the first day of playing,4
The game is so fun and time consuming,5
Amazing and addicting game. Devs are responsive. Looking forward to future features and updates .,5
Almost perfectly like brave frontier. Too many updates. : ( I was looking forward to playing it.,1
Just Amazing,5
"The game runs well, the graphics are endearing and cute in a chibi way. The story so far is fairly simplistic, but harmless enough. The game as a whole seems to be well made and enjoyable.",5
IR TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE,2
Meh,3
Simple and fun.,5
Love the multitude of options and you don't have to play as the main character love the freedom to choose it all than you so much for making this game.,5
"I tried to install this like 3 times. I get to the tap to start prompt, tap it, then it says I need an update. When I tap on the update it just brings me back to the Google play page. 0 stars if I could.",1
"Different gameplay, fast paced with great elements! Definitely recommend",5
Like the game,5
"To be honest, this game is pretty fun. Ever since I downloaded it, I haven't really put it down at all. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys RPGs with smooth gameplay. Game constantly updates but doesn't come as a hindrance to me.",5
Cute boys,5
Good rpg so far although should be played with wifi because there is a lot of extra downloads needed for cut scenes and it doesn't seem to be very pay to win but I haven't gotten too far in yet,5
An incredibly endearing visual style and ost combined with solid gameplay makes this game pretty fantastic,5
"A game that has potential but ruined by the gacha system. The player has to rely on summoning better heroes in order to complete advanced levels. The co-op system is integrated well but it should allow players to co-op in any level. There are levels that can only be completed in solo style but it requires the player to have premium units that are obtained through gacha. This game includes cards called wyrmprints which provide minimal differences to unit stats. Unfortunately there are ""legendary"" wyrmprints which dilute the premium gacha pool with useless cards. You may think you're getting a legendary unit or dragon but ends up as a legendary wyrmprint instead. Very frustrating to the player and it's unfair. Therefore, I recommend others to play a more forgiving gacha game called Fire Emblem: Heroes.",1
Negus,5
It coo,5
I think you this game is perfect it's just that canyou guys fix the movment for me it's hard,5
"they are pretty generous when it comes to freebies, the holiday events are fun, and it's really only pay to upgrade faster, not pay to win which is nice.",5
"The AI needs work, really frustrating watching my whole party die easily to maps and bosses.",3
Didn't even let play it stayed on a white screen,1
Easy simple controls awsime graphics keep it up,5
Would prefer horizontal screen options,4
Game,5
"Good, addictive and immersive story. I'm hooked to it and actually want to play it unlike other games of this kind",5
I'm currently doing most of the endgame content and I like it so far. This is the only gotcha (that i have played) where you don't NEED a 5* to make it far and I like that about the game.,5
It's great,5
"Dragalia Lost is an incredibly fun action rpg with a ridiculous amount of polish! If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, you'll love this one!",5
The graphics are amazing and the story line is on point,5
Very time consuming,5
"Great game, I really like it. You don't find very good games like this often. Good job, and keep up with the good work! Nice music as well by the way.",5
"It was fun at first but quickly became repetitive. Despite the different weapon types, none of them felt that different from each other. Also, the controls felt clunky and I couldn't always get my character to use their charge attack since they would sometimes just walk forward instead.",3
"Simply put, the best Fantasy RPG I've ever played on the Android platform. The graphics are beautiful, the characters interesting, the storyline engaging, and the game play is smooth and intuitive. I absolutely love this game!!",5
Great game,5
Very fun and in depth,5
Seems fun so far,4
Beautifully crafted and polished to a shine,5
Totally love this game,5
Great game so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
😎,5
Amazing game. Love the characters,5
Great job Nintendo!,5
Easy and fun mobile game for anyone to enjoy,5
"Very addictive game, can't stop playing, the story is very good",5
So fun,5
It's really good!,5
Its an awsome game i love it so very much,5
"The game is fun so far since it's just pve having bad rolls or not even pulling at all is something you can do which i find to be a big plus. However there are some problems my biggest one is the AI partners you take into battle feel pretty useless for the most part. They just stand still and just stare at you while enemies attack them, or attack enemies with shields up so they do no damage. Im not hoping that the AI will be just as good as the person controling their team leader but more so that it doesn't feel like i have to solo the mission or have a vastly higher might than the mission requires.",4
Its one of the best games out there,5
Great game only complaint is... too much downloading between scenes would prefer one big download versus a lot of small ones,5
"Ignore the low ratings.. This game is awesome.. The people who rate this game low are either salty people or they are so dumb they probably have trouble manually dialing a phone number. The game is f2p(for the time being) but there are people out there that throw tantrums when they dont get what they want from the gacha. Download this game, play and enjoy.",5
The controls are to sensitive other than that it's the best,5
DRAGONS,5
Love every Nintendo game I play. This is no exception,5
This game is really fun but for some reason the character's and stuff you can break are pitch black.,4
"Great game I really love the controls, theme, and story",5
Great time killer and great story,4
This game is the best mobile nintendo game ever,5
Thank you Nintendo for creating this good of a game also to the co creators thank you.,5
Love it...,5
Awsome game i think if you bring zelda to mobile it should be like this,5
Cool,5
Fun game nice to play when you're board.,5
Nintendo you really out did your self here but moving around is a little bit wonky but other than that a really good game,5
Good game,4
Its great,5
It gud,5
The game is pretty fun and have some pretty interesting anime like moments what's a good soundtrack that might get a little tiring after you hear it a couple times but I enjoy it,5
"It's a great game, ill tell every one about it. I enjoyed the game very much..",5
"Decent game. Great graphics and interesting characters. Gameplay is solid and can be done with one hand. However, initial download is massive and long. It does provide the option for English and Japanese voiceovers. This is lovely and should always be the defacto option in my opinion.",4
DOWNLOAD AND ENJOY!!!!,5
Beautiful game love the graphics,5
Honestly I'm very impressed as far as gotcha games this is honestly addicting it pulls me in like dokkan battle pulls me in,5
It's pretty good,5
It great,5
Really fun game with great developers. Highly recommended!,5
nice,5
"The game's UI, gameplay, and overall aesthetic is attractive, fun and damn near perfect. Has a killer soundtrack!",5
Fun,5
It good.,5
This the best game i ever play,4
I think Nintendo pulled a good one with this one,5
"Polished animation and graphics, great soundtrack, & easy to pick up mechanics. However, please keep in mind this game has a huge storage footprint. I had to uninstall because I didnt have enough room on my phone! The initial few loads were 700MB each time!",4
Love the concept and story just couldn't get used to the controls,5
This game is way too big. Good story but is so large it's hard to download unless you have over 1 gig of space.,3
I like this game. It's fun and simple but the controls should be better. The controls right now work best if someone was playing this on a tablet but on a phone it's a little hard.,5
"Fun, but prolly some of the worst drop rates u will ever see in a gacha game, it's very clear u have to spend money to get 5 star anything, but nonetheless it is fun for a little bit.",2
Fun and simple time killer,4
I think that this game is really fun and to make more games like this,5
Love it,5
Quick fun,5
Amazing quality.,5
I LOVE THIS GAME WHO CARES ABOUT THE HATERS CONTROLS WERE FIXED AND RUNS SO SMOOTHLY HOWEVER the Ai that follow you around are trash BUT ITS STILL REALLY GOOD I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE,5
Great game,5
Fun and interesting,4
Love it except for how much time you spend downloading,5
10/10,5
Awesome,5
It's a lot of fun to play with others.,5
"Love the change from what i normally play. Good job Nintendo, you should stuck to thus platform for game creation.",5
Beautiful. Good voice acting. Enjoying it so far!,5
"1 star permanent. Not only are the Roll rates some of the worst on mobile entirely, instead of giving you new content, they'll just change a characters outfit! With a 1% chance to roll it. Even moreso, this is an rpg right? But then they will come out with a BETTER VERS of the exact same character you just spent every gem on leveling it, requiring 1500 gems to roll 1% chance to get the better vers. When completing major quests give you 25 gems. Not a single reply after this long? It's because you know you should be ashamed to wear Nintendo on your lapel.",1
"Can't play the game. Trying to start, it says it needs an update. There us no update. Cannot get past start screen.",1
Trash. horrible control and horrible gotcha system. Extremely p2w.,1
So far a fun enough game and doesn't seem to constantly ask me to throw money at it.,5
Needs offline,5
"Actually a really fun game with easy controls, nothing to complicated or overly simple",5
I like this game,5
The game is amazing but Zodiarks dragon trial is way to difficult to complete on any difficulty I have 7000+ might and have a friend over 12000 and we can't even beat expert,3
"The start is very slow, and only after going through 5 playable scenes they ask for a review... I haven't even completed the tutorial and unlocked all modules in the menu lol from what I have played so far, the story is enjoyable and characters are likable, the graphics are okay for what they are... chibi anime models. The only thing that bugs me so far is the controls, I usually play games with both hands but this game is meant to be played with one. Gonna play more and maybe my review will change.",4
I think itscool,5
Damn this is a good game. THANK YOU for making it ftp. I would love to see a console version of this.,5
Love Love it needs auto thought,5
Fun so far,4
Love it I love the story so far can't wait to see what happened next.,5
Low rates and trash localization with boomer tier humor,1
The game is so fun it is so lit I never ever wanted to delete this game from the Google app store or anything just keep up the good work and make another good game like this bye,5
Best game ever,5
I love the art work and people to keep up the good work,5
"This is a very very fun game and it's my new favorite game, but the controls are, not good, it's very difficult move around but overall gameplay is awesome! 😀",5
"Good quality, fun game.",5
Good,5
Nintendo for life!,5
Cool,5
If controlling your character wasn't so difficult and this game didn't have to download huge updates every 5 mins it would be a phenomenal game. Oh and it lags pretty bad sometimes. Everything else was super coo though,5
Very good game,5
Very appealing visually!,5
Nice,5
Poop,5
Awesome story and characters,5
"It's a good game, and if given time it could become an even greater game that could be very impressive.",5
Its a good game but the in game download takes way to long,4
Controls are very laggy and at times unresponsive. Gacha system eventually encourage yo pay for a chance to get the units you want.,2
Awesome👏✊👍👍😎👍😎,5
I thunk it was what i wanted iut of an mmorpg.,5
It's not bad at all. Plus having a story and individual character stories are always a plus as well.,4
Really good,5
Great stuff best handheld platformer ever!!!,5
Not a fan of the controls at all.,3
This game is extremely addicting but on aome phones if you put the graphics on high it'll lag but other than that it is amazing!,5
Great game!!!!,5
Interesting,4
It good,5
"I love the game and everything about it, the events, the story, the characters but this game takes up waaayyyyy to much space at around 2.6 gigabytes",4
"Amazing story and killer soundtrack. Also, a pixie I do not regret meeting.",5
I love this game.,5
"Great game, good controls.",5
Ooooooooohhhhh. Maaaaaaaaannnnnnn.,5
The game is amazing it's the best rpg ever made and Nintendo's greatest mobile game I only have 1 problem... I don't like the movement it needs a joystick.,5
"Good game, but needs the option to move data to SD card. 3 gigs is a lot",3
Really lackluster Gacha. Expected a lot more from Nintendo,3
"The game itself is sort of like almost every mobile game out there. The positive side is they have actual voice overs for both English and Japanese so it plays out sort of like an anime. The controls aren't that great when moving around. You have to constantly pick up your finger and then drag again in the direction you are trying to head. But it's a mobile game and I've only just played the intro so don't expect much, but it's a good way to kill time. But make sure you actually download the batch download from settings so you aren't constantly having to download for every next mission.",4
Its amazing. I like,5
The only problem I have with it is all the additional files that need to be downloaded. Multiple times.,3
"Addictive, good story, funny characters. I give it a 7 outta ten. Only thing test would make it better would be a joystick in lower corner in staff of swipe to move. Just a tad janky",5
Ok first off I haven't been able to make in game purchases in this game since the first week this game came out I've contacted support multiple times and they keep giving me the same copy an past response and try this try that. But non of that works I'm going on almost 2 weeks of not being able to make purchase to buy diamonds to participate in summons on banners. You would think I'm trying to spend money on this game they would fix it for me but they don't . And then don't even get me started on on the summons the rates are complete garbage to get 5 star unit. So understand you don't need a 5 star units to complete content but this is a hero collector and if u come out with cool 5 star units people are going to want them but if you want the 5* units you have to basically buy diamonds to get them. The game also becomes pay to play once u complete story and all basic content of free gems it's becomes really hard to get gems . I give this game a month if they don't fix before everyone gets tierd of the gacha rates and the pay to play aspect to keep up with the gachas.,2
It good,5
It's not bad but suffers from the same overcluttered menus that plague iOS games.,4
Love the music,5
Little better control now !,2
Awesome should definitely download this. Pls add better control tho,5
Gacha rates are pretty bad but the company is fairly generous. The gameplay is fun and there are lots of things to do even though the game just released.,5
"The game's graphics are amazing! The gameplay is simple, the game is generous on currency, great on updates, and I enjoy all the extras the game has to offer!!",5
this game is cool,5
Its fun,4
"Great story, cute characters, joystick can be a little clunky but mobile rpg so can be expected... my biggest problem is that this game is Huge. Now, hear me out... I like that it is big inside the game, just wish I didn't feel like I was always downloading new bits because the batch file is so big.",4
i had alot of fun already using the halloween elise and i loved the gameplay,5
I think its a good game just thats the controls are a little finicky at times,5
Pretty good,5
Best game ever just turn off the glitch when you enter cutscense,5
Best ever,5
"Adorable and addictive. Also a great replacement for Rune Story, which was one of my favorite games...this is that for me now.",5
I love the graphics and voice lines,5
"Pretty fun, but not sure if it is P2W yet",4
Good,5
This game is extremely enjoyable and the story is pretty good too,5
Its fun,4
ely's mammaries,5
"Nothing remarkable. Found controls unpleasant when compared to a game with similar mechanics, Bleach Brave Souls.",3
"Remember Colopl Rune Story? It's that. Controls are a bit stiff, transforming into a dragon is cheesy (and a bit pointless tbh), and if you don't batch download you'll suffer. But you can skip the story to avoid the cheese, and the chibi characters are either cute or hilarious. Pretty break even game.",3
Great game,5
It was okay,1
It's amazing,5
Its a lot of fun,5
Hard to approach but once you recognize how the progression systems it's impossible to put down,5
Very unique and I love how the game plays. Beautiful graphics.,5
AMAZING,5
It's pretty darn good.,5
Amazing game. The controls needs a bit of work though.,5
Way to many downloads to keep playing. Some downloads take a while and u can't play till it finishes download. But the game all in all is great. Would b better without downloading every board.,4
When I was doing the tutorial all the characters were just black unless this problem is solved I cannot give of any higher stars.,1
So far so good,5
It's pretty fun.,4
Its a fun game with plenty to do,5
Way awsome,5
Extremely limiting stamina system. No thanks.,1
If they have auto it would be good,4
Awesome,5
YO. WHY THIS GAME SO HIGH QUALITY????? LIKE DO YOU HEAR THIS SOUNDTRACK????? ITS LIT.,5
Game seems interesting and gave a lot of free stuff out but having to download every level is too much.,3
Fun game so far. Love the graphics,5
"It does a very good job at confusing you, until you know what you're doing. Worth playing and is very fun",5
"This game is pretty fun and isn't at all in your face about spending money. However, I would say if you're the type of person who spends money on mobile games to avoid this one (I don't think the prices they are charging for the premium currency are anywhere near being fair for what you can get with it).",4
Fun,5
I like the game hate all the updates and you should add an item shop to buy weapons,4
Fun game,5
It is fun and simple,4
Very impressive fun and great gameplay just like other nintendo titles 👍,5
"I love this game, a lot. Now I see the reviews and while I understand how people say the drops are awful (agreed, although I've been rather lucky), and people complain about the controls, and other things but remember, this is a mobile Action RPG. I find that this usually doesn't work great, in the controls department at least, and you also throw in some gatcha stuff and it seems like an utter nightmare... The thing is, it isn't, in fact it's the most fantastic, non-gatcha feeling gatcha, beautiful mobile game I've played. It's great really. Now let's get one thing clear, there are tons of free stuff, everyone seems to forget that in their reviews. Throughout the story you get some good heroes and dragons, and the summons are just there to supplement for skills and dry times in the story. It's great really. And to add two this, everyone is unbelievably charming, I love them all and find myself feeling sad that I can't bring ALL my free, story characters. I've never felt sad about what I pull (other then bad dragons), and with no PvP, the only thing I'm beating is the events and story. Speaking of events, I love and hate them, I feel pressured to play them due to their limited time nature, but the story they add is very enjoyable and endearing. They stress me out a bit, but make me smile more often then not. The whole game does really. Now before I go on too long I'll end it now... This game: - Unbelievably charming - Smile inducing - Musically and visually stunning And best of all, doesn't feel pay-to-win at all, sure there's limited rewards that may benefit people who pay money, but it's not forced down the non-paying player's throat, in fact, I was wondering if this game would make any money at all when I got it!",5
"So far it seems approachable, interesting and like there is a plot. It doesn't feel as on-rails as some others I have tried, and the interface is pretty well designed!",4
Best mobile game EVER!!!!,5
Such a cute and adorable action rpg! Very easy to pick up.,4
This game is so cute and charming! I really love the character designs and the little comics that come along with it. It feels happy and carefree to play. Just what I need to put a smile on my face!,5
Fun and simple,5
"So many issues. Moving any direction besides a straight line is an exercise in frustration, dodging response is sluggish, advised power levels are inaccurate, and to make matters worse, I can't recover my account with Nintendo link. Trying opens up my web browser and the game cancels the link. Tried on 4 other devices and an emulator with the same result. Uninstalling.",1
Great game onlybissue is you have to download more for each level you do. Everything you do requires another download.,4
"One of the best if it's kind imo. Most ""Gotcha"" games turn me off but the fullness of the story and deepness of gear system makes me like it a bit better. MUSIC Is very good, most I can remember and hum for a day or so after playing, but in the good way! 8/10 would recommend!",5
Very good game very well made,5
"Has lots of content such as different characters, dragons, and a decent story. There are different ways to get stronger such as powering up characters, weapons, cards (wyrimprints), or dragons. It has a balance of how much to play each day, so it doesn't feel like it asks too much of your time in a single day. However, the controls during battle are awkward. There are times when the game loses track of my finger and suddenly dodges. The force strikes are probably the worst one as they require a slingshot like mechanic to use the attack for most characters. This makes it difficult to aim at what enemy you want to hit. It also mistakes my finger placed onto the screen not as a force strike, but me wanting to move slightly to wherever I wasn't pointing at. So when I want to use a force strike on an enemy with a shield, as my computer allies needlessly wail on it only to lose more of their health, the first thing that happens is usually my character moves slightly to wherever before I correct it. Next, I charge up my attack and aim, except the enemy is moving, the camera isn't truly top down perspective so the angle might be off, and also leaves you vulnerable. This really kills the pacing for a lot of my missions. There is a really good game in here, and if you can get pass the tedious awkwardness of the controls, you may find yourself enjoying the game too. Gacha games don't always have a good reputation, but as long as the game encourages Cooperation and hopefully avoid PvP, unlucky draws might not bother you as much. Also its CPU allies are practically unreliable. They will often split up or go into death zones without your consent. Your CPU Healer will most likely let you down by refusing to attack an enemy to build up heal skill, or just get hit by the most obvious death zones. They are however for some reason, good at dodging traps around 90% of the time. Auto aim is hard to control, and sometimes you can miss an enemy entirely.",1
"So Far, ""So Good"".",4
"Wonky controls, hard to adjust from other games. Ram heavy for low end processor ran phones.",5
Worth it,5
Pretty fun timewaster,4
It sucks!!!,1
Grat game,5
Immediately required 1gb download. Can't play in airplane mode. Could not figure out how to access options. Maybe this game is fun but it wouldn't let me find out.,1
Reminds me of breath of fire. Great game.,4
Absolutely awesome.,5
The cost for storage of this game is too high. Sooner or later im going to have to delete the app,3
RNJesus + poor ally ai makes for a poor over complicated system that drags down what good points it has. Controls are poor and become unresponsive when enemy ai starts using their aoe abilities.,1
"Ive only played for an hour and its amazing!!! Keep up the great work, nintendo!",5
"Pretty fun time sink; the multiple mb downloads are a bit annoying and the camera needs work, but I'm having fun",4
redid the review. its bettr. the english dub is not an issue anymore. not bad at all.,4
Fix the game. Too many bugs.,1
Well played Nintendo,5
Great music,5
I'm having problems with downloading the game to even start playing.,2
I think its great but work on back graownd lhigting plz,5
"Very fun game. There are lots of things to do, and the multiplayer provides help for the challenging missions/events. I'm addicted to this game.",5
Pretty enjoyable but I mainly dodge roll since I play on a small phone other than that its all good.,4
XD,5
"So I can't give this a 5 because of the amount of grind. But if you don't mind investing in the long term for the characters to get stronger this is probably the best gotya I've ever played. Characters have personality and each feel useful, all the systems are fun. It's gonna exploit you but it's fun and charming",4
This game freezes my phone. Fix this and my rating will increase.,1
Just amazing,5
"Dragalia Lost is not the most original game out there. And some people will find it repetitive, or cliche at points. But honestly, this is one of the first mobile RPGs I have played where I read a majority of the text, and actually laughed a bit. The dragons mostly all have cool, cute, or majestic designs, the other characters all have a little bit of story development, even if small, to make them feel like actual characters, and the lore and world itself is pretty interesting, and feels like a classic rpg. Also, the microtransactions. Yeah. They exist. It is a free to play game. But I found the game to be very generous in rewarding you just for doing daily tasks, and putting time into it. Honestly, I didn't feel pressured to purchase anything because like... you get a currency that let's you roll for new characters and dragons just for playing through quests, and doing daily stuff. Yes, paying will boost you ahead. But really, it wasn't anything where I felt like I had to pay. More of a 'if I paid, I could make this part easier by quickly leveling a few characters.' Overall a pretty well put together game.",5
"This game has A lot of my favorite qualities. The characters are good and not overly sexualized, the story is interesting, the game mechanics are unique and fun, no extremly dramatic cutscenes, beautiful music and the game is not majorly difficult is any way but isn't so simple I get bored in the first few seconds. This is a great game and I recommend getting it.",5
"The controls for movement during combat is really bad. Especially if you have a small screen, it takes some getting used to and still feels bad. Gaccha style making it seem like a pay to win game. So-so graphics. Ok story. I thought the idea of turning into dragons would be cool but everything else is a bit... poor, in my opinion",1
Great game.,4
I love this game!,5
Summon rates are low but gameplay is good.,4
I love this the principal is so cool I love his sowrd,5
It seem like another play for free pay to win game,3
Fun rpg,5
"Awesome game, one of my best games so far, keep up the good work. 😌👊🏾",5
Good 👍,5
A really pretty game. The combat is a little messy along with the controls but nothing extraordinarily terrible. I wish there were more quests with cutscenes and less cutscene quests with no fighting.,4
"The games graphics a pleasing and the gameplay is pretty fun, but the greatest part has been the soundtrack. Every song I've heard so far has been a treat especially with the vocals.",5
Great game,5
"This is such a fun game, I don't want to stop playing. It employs similar tactics as other mobile games but it is more generous than most. The gameplay is really fun and hits a good balance of complicated to require strategy, but simple enough that it isn't overbearing. I don't like gatcha systems, but it isn't too bad here since the resources are so generous",5
"Great visuals, amazing music, and most importantly, it doesn't drown you in requests to spend money",5
It's a nice original story and classic dungeon crawler RPG feel. I'm still new to the game but so far I like it. Need to incorporate a touch control layout option,4
This game Pretty awesome very fun I like to go co-op mode I don't like the bugs where I can't connect or the game is full and a half to keep on clicking over and over on to get a new co-op group,5
It's great work,5
"Great game with terrible Customer Service Team. I downloaded the game on Day 2 of the release did the raid, got 3 Pele's, had a bunch of 5 star units but my Android phone for some reason didn't want to download the new patch and when it would get to 99.99% downloaded it would say I had a connection error. I am always connected to my wifi when I play this game. I've contacted the Customer Service Team 6-7 times now. Each message is 2-3 hours from the previous one. I have still heard nothing and it's going on day 3. I lost all of my saved data because I uninstalled the game to try and manually get the patch to work with the game all at once... I also don't have a Nintendo account. I was hoping they would restore the data for me....but heard nothing. No communication from the Dragalia Lost Team. Very disappointed.",2
"Great gameplay, story and music. Skill based dodging, all that you'd want from an active RPG. My criticism is the A.I. needs some work.",5
It's really fun,5
Why is it so large so many extra downloads?,1
Fun,5
Fun game to play in short spurts. I really love the Character Stories you unlock by working on even the low star characters. My phone is a bit too old for the game though.,5
Had to download 600+mb of extra data to play three levels than had to download another 900+mb to continue. Not cool. I have a limited amount of data each month.,1
I just got in and it said error,1
Love it!,5
Been waiting for a game like this just wish u didn't have to download at every new spot,5
"Pretty good so far. Cute graphics, nice gameplay. Usual low gacha rates though",4
"The game itself is great, but there are a couple aspects that I absolutely hate. You constantly have to download new things and it gets incredibly annoying. On top of this, the game play is in the portrait mode. I cannot even begin to explain how mad this makes me.",3
"Great game. You have to reroll a lot though to start the game with 5 star characters or else you'll be in for a bad time though. Anyway, amazing music, storytelling, gameplay, pacing, and art. Extremely high quality.",5
Love it a lot it's awesome,5
I downloaded the game before I got to even play it said update is required so I tried but there was nowhere to update it so I uninstalled it and tried again and same thing happened,2
Love the game and has an intriguing story,5
"The artwork, graphics, and music are fantastic. The controls are simple and responsive, and you get plenty of currency early on to get yourself a small collection of characters to choose from. Just make sure to save for tenfold summons rather than single summons",5
Dope game!,5
"I don't mind the gacha so much, but this requires so much space, and there's so much dialog! It's just not worth it for me.",1
Great game gonna keep playing.,5
Menu music is permanently stuck in my head/10,5
"I don't what y'all talking about ""boring"". This game is hella fun. 👍",5
One star all the way because the damn thing won't even let me get through the initial registration screens.,1
I love this game you turn into a dragons and i hope is gonna be on nintendo switch,5
"5 stars! The game reminds me of old final fantasy games and jrpgs. Story is engaging, and the voice acted dialog is a nice surprise.",5
THIS GAME IS NOT LETTING ME EVEN FIND A SERVER AND WHY IS THERE TWO DIFFERENT ONES,1
Stop putting this on youtube. It takes lots of space on your android phones. Do not download it.,1
"The game itself is super fun, but it's a big drain on storage and battery life.",4
5 stars great graphics and music,5
It is awesome,5
Its fun and combat is high speed but grind hits hard andway to high price cash shop,5
Igood game,5
Nintendo did it again. This game plays great. Thee graphics are excellent. I am very supriae6 this wasn't a Switch title. Bravo.,5
"Another stellar mobile game from Nintendo and Cygames. This is a collectathon gotcha inside a very nice action RPG gameplay system. Move your characters around the 3D space, run, dodge, use specials, transform, use spells, etc. The graphics are very nice, chibi type characters mixed with solid effects in battle and a well directed artstyle for the 2D character portraits. Seems to be a long and well written campaign. Even the voice acting is WAY above average for a mobile product. All around very solid",5
"good game, great music",4
Can't buy package. Endless incomplete purchase while there's none.,3
Awesome game so far .. =),5
Love it,5
"So far, so good. Beautiful graphics, interesting story. I like how you can read extra stories of both characters and dragons. The controls are a little wonky. Not very smooth, but something I can work with. Younger players may find them to be extremely frustrating. The October event was okay. Fun, but the reward for using the temporary character (can't remember her name) could have been more. Too much work for too little gain. I didn't even try to win her. Overall, though the game is doing well.",4
"Terrible controls, afkers, toxic players, no block system, QoL needs work.",1
Nice game big fun gacha addiction give me rainbow ok please collab event in future,5
"I love the game, but I agree that it can get boring.",4
It's so cute and poppy. I love it.,5
"Wow going into it I had low expectations because the current review score is so low, but my mind has been blown , the story, music,and graphics are on point and awesome, the controls could be little better but I seriously would be nit picking to take a star for that, I highly recommend to anime fans, there is coop and events and stuff like an mmorpg so I can see myself playing this for long time to come, too many features to list, give it a try!",5
Great game. Stamina later on limits how much you can invest time but it is fun.,5
This game is awesome! The music and the storyline are great! This now my favorite game.,5
Nice,5
"The game is awesome! Good, funny, and interesting stories to read! Great graphics and gameplay is fun! A lot of farming.. it can be a little repetitive but it's still fun!",5
"Very solid RPG,similar to old school Final Fantasy.Has a very immersive story,and great music.",5
Is there an auto function? Besides that its an amazing game,5
Great,5
This is probably the best action RPG I have played on a phone.,5
It is very cool because you can shape shift into a Dragon,5
just play granblue haha lmao,1
It has a good story so far,5
Ntap,5
Real fun game,5
Great game,5
Just another collect toons and battle game.,3
Best soundtrack ever.,5
Says update is needed even though I just downloaded it,1
Cant even play it keeps telling me to update with a update i cant get,1
It's the best game EVER😃😃😃😃,5
"Great game, fun controls and combat is exciting. I really enjoy the visuals, and while the auto play is nice I actually like playing this game.",5
"Love it, keeps my attention and makes me want to play",5
linear,1
My game works great now really enjoy everything controls are simple gameplay high quality it looks like ehat they were going for so im happy,5
"Fun game, great sound track and voice actors. Downside is the stamina stsytem. Enjoying everything else.",5
Disconnects constantly during Co-op mode. Horrible.,1
Ita good... but the controls are a little touchy,5
Yes is cool,5
"I like this game alot. I think the only thing I wish it had was an auto button, if for nothing else but the adventure mode😂. Other then that, so far I don't see anything thats stopping me from playing anytime soon!",4
"Beautiful song, I like the characters and it's amazing game. No problem with the game.",5
"3.5 Stars is pretty accurate. Spoiler free plot review: If you like anime tropes, you'll probably enjoy the lighthearted dialogue. Otherwise, its a fairly cliche fantasy. Down to earth Prince has to save the world with the help of dragons, a lot of girls who fawn over him, and that one token big tough guy so its not blatantly a boobsfest. Oh, and bunny ears, because awe, bunnies! Lol! Gameplay: The gameplay had a lot of potential. Problem is, you get bogged down by obscene amounts of level grinding for everything, the 50 million different items and menus you have to grind for (as if the grinding wasn't boring enough, now you have to pay attention to what means what) and so so controls. I still have no idea what most of the stuff actually does, including 1 out of the 5 different currencies I have found so far. Still, when you get to fight the bosses and run though levels attacking as your character yells out something cheeky, there is some void that is filled there that I can't explain. You will know if you like it at the end of the first chapter. Putting aside its flaws though, its cute, the music is actually really freaking good, and the characters are light hearted and fun. I'm enjoying it enough to not delete it. At very least, I want to see the main plot to the end.",4
Very enjoyable.,5
Cool,5
"Great game, never played any of the nintendo made rpgs but i can see why theyre liked so much! Interesting story so fae as well!",5
The first few days it's really fun but it gets old quickly.,4
Its a great nintendo game,5
"Ok so I was very excited waiting an waiting for this game to finally come out. But sadly now that it is, I'm a bit disappointed. Cause it's a fun game. There are just so many downloads, back to back to back to back downloads just to keep going forward in the game. That I didn't even bother making it through the first half of the game. Cause after the downloading playing a very short intro, there was another download, then I got to play another short clip before getting hit again with a download, after doing several of these I have an bot even getting through the tutorial I gave up and have sadly uninstalled it. I would have to say that this would have been a really fun game, cause I liked what little a did play, but the over abundant downloads ruined it for me completely.",3
"The drag controls are interesting. It takes me a whike to get the hang of it, but overall, 11/10!!!",5
"Its honestly quite a good game. It has a unique story, good graphics and voice acting, the only complaint i have is that the combat controls could uze some work, and also stamina drains a little fast. Also it takes up a lot of space.",4
"It is a really good game that might take people time to get use to, but if u do it will be really fun.",5
Great game story is really good and the designs are good too,4
"Adorably cute, story-rich RPG game you've been waiting for. I love this game so much. Also the music by Japan's own Daoko is *amazing*",5
Great game!,5
was fun but needed a better way to control the characters and the rate for spawns of ither featured or just 5 star units was stupidly low saved all my gems i ever got till i could do a 100 summons and only 2 of them were worth menchioning in short save your money untill they buff the rates if your going to play otherwise the game gives you enough materials to make it through chaper 5 fairly eazily withought stopping and ill admit for thier raid even which wnded recently i was plesently aupprised to see you could eazily obtain a free 4 star unit that isnt to bad honestly in short its fun for now but wait on this one of you want to sspend money on it,4
"Overall fun game, but when i hit the multiplayer option of the tutorial, the game didnt let me progress.",4
The Gameplay and Music are great,5
"Just finished ch 3, so far loving the art, the music (pure Bliss btw), and haven't had any of the connection issues mentioned by others (Pixel first gen). Love the combination of weapons, dragons, characters, and then your typical advantage elements. The multiplayer is outstanding, and story is somewhat generic but enjoyable. Update: The gacha system is frustrating. Combining the Wyrmprints with the characters and dragons has significantly lowered the dragon/character drop rate. As a seasonal character is up, I've sunk significant cash into hopes of obtaining it, only to have my heart broken. As Wyrmprints are not a living thing, they should be in the same category item summons, followed by a readjusting gacha rate for the equilibrium of characters and dragons left. I've provided a player experience review with a solution, please take this into consideration.",3
This game is pretty good but its controls are kind of hard.,5
This Game Has An Great Story.,5
"My first thoughts were "" an RPG by Nintendo? This will be great"". The prologue was great, with voice acting and then I read some reviews and I was like they are just salt. Upon returning the game I was met with the typical micro transaction daily bonus screen. From there it went all down hill. It's not a bad game, but I want an OctoPath Traveler on a phone. As a big fan of JRPGs I dont like the direction of mobile gaming. So I am giving this game a 3 for not doing anything different from every other mobile rpg",4
"It strongly depends on money, also there is millions of games like this one its copy paste gotcha game",1
Fun Runs smooth. Good action. Lots of items.,5
"While it gets boring after a while, it's very obvious that a lot of hard work was put into the story and characters. Never before have I seen a gacha game where every character has their own unique story. I enjoyed how the fact that they made the controls one handed but I don't like what happens when you turn too quickly.",5
The gameplay is fun the story is not bad but the gacha rate SUCKS you almost never got a 5 char or dragon you will only get a 5 equip item but no one wants that and the constant downloading every mission you do I wanted this game to be good but it's not sadly,2
"This RPG has a great story and gameplay. After the first couple in-game downloads, you're set. Well done guys!",5
A game worth of my time,5
The games story is it's bread and butter and high ratings are all it should be raking in.,5
"Of all the mobile gacha games I've played over the years, this is one of the best.  The level of polish is very high, everything is well designed and crisp.  The gameplay is actually fun and skill based, unlike most mobile games.  There is plenty to do without spending any money.  A free player can see all the content there is, and can farm the best weapons without spending anything.  The developers have been very good at communication and quick to fix bugs and implement feedback.  If the game keeps going in this direction, I see it being one of the top gacha games out there.",5
I can dig it,4
"It is great, there are frames drops here and there, but overall it is what you expect from a collaborative between Nintendo and cygames",4
The mini-dungeons with simple combat controls really came as a surprise to me. It's a mini action-crawler and gacha in your pocket.,5
Should have been way better. Over all disappointed,1
Great game!,5
Nice and fun,4
RNG is bad been trying to get a nat5 freebie until now haven't pull anything.. forget it,5
"Very fun, and cute.",4
"Very cute! I like the character and dragon stories, and the voice acting.",5
"great game, apolowyrmites when",5
So good. Great story great gameplay,5
"Great game, it's really fun and the characters are lovable. I would reroll a couple times until you get a character you like or one from the meta.",5
Liked the game. Had to uninstall after I ran out of room to update it.,4
Great music great voice acting love gaicha games,5
"Ever since the game has been out it's doing a good job so far with constant events. Pretty cool to be able to do story mode with other players. Other games that are similar to this don't even have multiplayer for story mode. Compared to other gacha games, the multiplayer system is pretty good. Game is pretty interactive. There is an auto feature for you lazy people out there but it's best not to do it in raids or any other high level events. Does take skill to dodge all those boss attacks. I know people hate the very low rates for summoning but what gacha game doesn't have low rates. As long as you do your dailies every day you should be able to do tenfold summons. Only suggestion I have for the rates is if they can increase the summon rates a little bit more for event 5-star characters. What I hope to look for in the future is for Nintendo not only add characters from their FEH gacha game, but some of their idol characters that would fit in this game such as Link. Can have different Links for different elements because he changes outfits just like his games. Or have Pit and Dark Pit for light and dark elements. Just a suggestion Nintendo if you are reading this! Overall, great game!",5
Decwnt mechanics and an inteuiging story line. Doesnt beat you over the head with ads and its not impossible to progress without spending money.,5
Keeps telling me to update to the newest version when I had literally just downloaded. So then of course I press update and it brings me to this exact page. And so even though I've downloaded it I can't play it :),3
I love the dragons,5
Best meme 2018,5
Fun game so far,4
It's a great game so far.,5
Game is So fun and addictive being a free to play i advance quite a bit alot things to do. God Bless those developers for updating the game and fixing many bug fixes and giving us little compensation rewards i love this game so much characters are interesting. only small gripe is when an enemy is knocked down they become invunerable for a second not sure if intended but other than that game fun,5
GBF mashed with Fire Emblem. P fun.,5
Gacha rates are bad but other than that the game is amazing. If you manage your resources well you can play the game as much as you want and Cygames is super generous with giving free resources plus x10 pull tickets.,5
awesome,5
"beautiful artwork, compelling story, fun events, slick gameplay, and an in game economy that feels fair and exciting instead of frustrating and grindy like other gatchas. so good.",5
It's a good game so far.i have to play more so I can give a honest answer,4
"I had high hopes, but it just feels too grindy and the gacha mechanic is not very satisfying, especially when you only get 5* Wyrmprints instead of the much more interesting and useful Adventurers or Dragons. The art-style and the music are both well done, and the story is decent to boot. Unfortunately, the meat of the game isn't as enjoyable. Plus I'm not a huge fan of the ""dragons"" that are just big-breasted ladies that look vaguely dragon-like... instead of, you know, just a damned cool dragon.",3
"Catchie soundtracks, decent controls, pretty good plot for this game so far. 😊",4
no auto. good job,5
Cool,5
"From what I've played, I wasn't that impressed with the ending of the first mission. The visuals are great, controls a little weird to get used to, but my biggest complaint is the way downloads have been laid out. The download system is chopped up per mission or chapter and can be a major inconvenience to those who want to play and finish in a day, and I know many players that'd prefer that. But outside of downloads, if you wanna play a semi decent and greatly designed RPG on the road, I recommend this game.",3
Has terrible rates. Blatant cash grab. Wyrmprints break pity rate (which is also terribly low) and are absolutely useless because the event prints will be best in slot both in raids and content. So congratulations for paying for useless trash that you can never use.,1
Awesome game....,5

Boring through and through,2
A wonderful game worth playing.,5
"Great game. Good storyline, some nice humor, and easy controls.",5
"Controls are a little hard getting used to, since I am a big mobile MOBA gamer. Other than that though, this game is fun and great!",5
"Gameplay is solid and very fun, but the summoning system brings the overall game experience down. So this is definitely not a good game for F2P ""collector style"" players.",4
"Played since launch and concluded this game is a lazy cash grab. I have played other mobages including fgo,gbf,feh,soa. They all have reasonable rates and yes I meant fgo too in comparison. Dragalia Lost is unforgiving in gacha especially with different types of pull i.e dragon, character, wyrmprints all in one gacha. It is a terrible blatant cash grab ideology and do not appreciate they are obvious testing various ways to make a quick buck. Gameplay is decent but gets stale. I trust Cygames will improve having been with Granblue from the very beginning. Also characters are not unique at all in gameplay, every character is practically just a weapon skin, differentiated by passive and skills. The animation is extremely lazy and not worth rolling for at all, though the dragons are much more unique, I fail to see why their characters are low quality and practically clones of each other. I hope Cygames drop this game and keep improving upon their better game Granblue Fantasy. Dragalia Lost Cause is how I would sum up this game.",1
Love the game can't get enough of it,5
BEST MOBILE GAME EVER!!! WELL DONE NINTENDO!!,5
Great game fun to play,5
"The game has a great concept but the controls are clunky and most of the characters attacks are just recycled from other same unit types. Special attacks don't feel like specials and lack of damage doesn't make the build up worth the wait. The games insanely hard to progress through without paying money and the rate of summons are terrible. Not only are the rate of summons bad, the creators combined cards, dragons, items, and units all into one summoning gate. This makes summoning anything good impossible. Then couple that with high gem requirements and low amount of gem drop causes the game to become boring fast. The lack of the creator to appeal to players causes a lack of players and so co-op is dead. Even if co-op was vibrant, it's still be impossible due to how difficult the bosses are for free players. Only those who are throwing money at the game will enjoy the game to it's full extent.",3
"Super fun, loved it.",5
"Good style, simple combat controls,",4
Solid ARPG with good music and art. Can easily avoid spending money as a casual player.,5
"It's a good game, just way too big!",2
Looks great love the music but controls and equipment and chars in same pool are terrible,2
A decent little gacha hack n slash game.,4
"Nintendo's new gatcha game is a quality game. The problem is that it has a lot of bugs regarding launching, updating, screen response and a host of other issues. Ive already lost my current profile due to an update bug. Where launching the game requests an update, which opens the google play app, which does not have an update available. However if look for Dragalia on the google play search bar, the update prompt is available when searching for it. Unfortunately the update button was simply alert you to the fact that you have already installed this game. I have uninstalled this game for the time being until this problem is fixed",3
Fun small rpg to play almost reminds me of my old gaming days as a kid,5
"I've been reading the comments and one issue that comes up alot is the low gatcha rates however while playing I can see why the game has low rates and its because it gives you gems for doing almost anything early on getting up to 1500 gems early on is really easy and just after 3 tenfold I had already gotten two five stars which are ridiculously over powered at the start of the game overall 5 star game music is fantastic however the game can repeat at times hope they add more animated scenes, more 5 star characters, and enemy variations.",5
"It's a pretty good game. Whenever I have to be away from my switch to be an adult to do adult things it keeps me entertained. Never spent a dime and I do apparently better than people who do spend money. Just get good, and you'll be fine.",4
Dragons,5
Love it,5
Great story and Characters,5
Has the Nintendo quality feel to it. Overall exceeded my expectations.,5
"Fun rpg hate the downloads though, wish it would just download everything in the beginning",4
"Draglia has incredible graphics, artwork, skills, music and animation compared to many other mobile RPGs. Non-turn based combat a big plus. Good storyline. Solid progression for ftp players. Lots to collect. Very good voice work also. One of the best most polished looking games I've seen in a while. I've only just started but will provide more complete review once I've delved deeper into the content but so far this is looking to be as solid as any FF mobile port or Tales of the Rays",5
Love it !,5
"The music is amazing, I sometimes just sit there listening to the music. The controls are simple and easy to understand. The story is decent, but typical save the world stuff. It is a gotcha game but I dont care. Get a lot of stuff daily to help level up so really dont have to spend money on grow characters (as of yet) 10/10 recommend",5
Really enjoying this game this far.,5
"Pretty fun game. Mechanics can be a bit challenging, and weapons designs need more creativity (specially for a Nintendo game), but has potential.",4
It is cool,5
GREAT GAME 90% but if you could add combo sttings like tap and hold after amount of taps or a swipe after an attack or like a attack combo string to unlock in game that would be cool good game btw,5
Could not download it got to 80% and restarted after 4 hours lmao it is Nintendo after all what else should i have expected,1
Pretty good so far,5
I'm glad I downloaded this game! Keep up the good work!,5
I love this game,5
I beat my meat to this,5
Dope concept and implementation.,5
Great game overall,4
It is a really good nintendo game and a god rpg,5
Ive no idea what people are complaining about. There's a Reddit for communication and info. The Gotcha rates arent that bad and each character had extensive backstory. Its fantastic!,5
"Everything I love about action RPG's made for Android/IOS, an a new Nintendo IP as well what's not to love? A lot actually it has everything I hate about mobile gaming all-in-one. Every single different type of got-u-system made down to getting duplicate to power up, with ridiculously overpriced in-game currency to extremely low drop chance costing you $32 a pop! After what Shigeru Miyamoto said at the developer conference about being too greedy with micro transactions this is sad that this is a new nintendo property. Until they fix how much the in game currency costs I'd have to say avoid this like the plague.",1
"It should have cac, not all of us are blond...",4
Great game,5
"Amazing game with quality graphics and animations. The mechanics, economy and gameplay are deep, and yet controls are appropriately easy.",4
Good and fun game,5
Fun game to play lots to do,5
"This game is a great game. The story is great and the need to spend money is almost non existent. The few reasons it's not a 5 star review are the controls being a bit off, the drop rates of characters to power up cards, and the constant downloading to play everything.",4
AWESOME and AMAZING!,5
"Took a bit to get used to, but I love this game and its playstyle! Worth a shot for sure.",5
Gaaayyyy!!,1
Fun and happy! Perfect for my down time.,5
Haters gonna hate because they don't get that rare cards are rare.,5
Great game love the story and gameplay. Only thing is it won't let me do co op battles since the start of loyalties requiem event.,4
"Really fun! No adds and you can play with other people around the world. I also love mythical stuff like dragons, fairies and elves which this game contains. I recommend this.",5
Awsome,5
I love it,5
Graphics are solid for it to be a phone game controls needs tightening doesn't follow directions well,4
It's good but the promblem is that it have bad words,4
Fun light hearted rpg,5
Need better control,4
Fantastic Pokemon mystery like game,5
"Is pretty great. I can definitely enjoy playing for the story, but since I'm not a collecter, I'm not sure about playing anything not related to the story.",4
"Won't play on my phone, says device is not authorized? T-Mobile lg k20",3
Very fun and easy to get into definitely worth a shot.,5
Do it,5
"[EDITED] The developers are super responsive to the community and are generous in rewards. I've played so many gacha games, but I've never seen a company that fixes problems in just a few weeks so fast before. Don't mind the bad reviews. It's a great company to invest your time into. SOUND TRACKS ARE WONDERFUL. YA-IYA-IYAIYAIYA--They have themed music too for the holiday. // Wyrmite Cards make up most of the gacha bulk that break pity points for profit if you have depressing rng :/. Wish there was a messaging system. Other than that, the graphics are beautiful and the individual stories (especially the dragons') are nicely crafted!",5
Good game,5
Make it less talky,5
Great graphics. Very addicting. I was hesitant at first when my friend told me about it.,5
Fun time🎃,5
It is 😎ool,5
Overall a really great game the controls are a bit dodgy and the main hub is a bit over bearing and cramped but those are my only two complaints. Everything else runs great and look just as good,4
Awesome,5
Love it.,5
"Great music, ok controls/gameplay, and some decent story. Worse thing was the characters. Most of the main characters can be summarized so easily because they're really generic but besides that great game. I think that if you could improve the controls and make the combat a bit more in depth by adding more moves and stuff like that would make it a 5 star game",4
"The game is fun at the start, but falls off qickly. For the difficulty of obtaining a 5 star unit, the reward is little to none. 5 star units and 4 star units feel exactly the same to play with, but 5 star units are much harder to earn. The game throws a ton of currency for summoning units at you in the beginning of the game, but hardly gives you any later. The gameplay is fun, but repetative to the point where you wish you could not only auto the fighting, but the menus aswell. The graphics are amazing, which is the only thing I still like about the game, but it takes up almost 2 gigs of data.",3
Needs more levels like the tutorial,4
Lots of loading,5
"Great game, amazing community, shaky gameplay but it's not too annoying. Definitely recommend it.",5
Cool,5
Fun to play,5
Great game,5
"I cannot progress after it forceing me to play co-op with an AI. I've been waiting to create a lobby for 10+ min and it just won't load, please fix this.",5
"Decent graphics, good art, relatively smooth controls and gameplay",4
"For a mobile game, the action RPG style isn't that bad. It may only use one finger, but how you chain combos on melee weapons can be fun. Ranged weapons are lackluster though, but are useful. Music is amazing and I enjoy the personal stories of the heroes and dragons. This game is very free to play friendly as well. You do NOT need a 5 star hero or dragon to get far in the game. Progression in this game revolves around improving Might, not gaining rare characters.",5
Touched me with its noodly appendage,5
"Super cute, fun, and the music is so catchy.",5
"Great game, feels great",5
"Its a great game i still enjoy, i just wish the controls for movement were different and a little bit more compatable for quicker movements",5
It is a good game,5
Seems like a fun polished game. Really wish there was bluetooth controller support as I'm not a fan of touch controls. Will keep playing.,5
Very generous with summon currency! Other games should take notes lol,5
"Pretty good game to have, fun to play. Can even play with friends.",5
"Great game, very addictive and cute designs. I do recommend this to anyone, the only downside in MY opinion is that it's a grind fest.",5
I love everything from the story to the gameplay,5
What happened to my previous negative review? The only things I'll repeat are that the controls suck due to lack of attack buttons and the main menu music is atrocious. Just because Nintendo's name is on here doesn't mean they made it btw,2
"A lot of fun! Great multiplayer mechanics, though matchmaking wait times are not consistent. Gameplay is solid with Focus Strikes being the only rough spot. Focus Strikes require you to hold your finger on the screen, but this often gets confused with a movement or dodge input. Graphics are amazing and the voice work is commendable with a few characters having some whiny or annoying voices. Overall, it is a very solid, very pleasing game!",5
Best OSTs for a mobil game,5
I like games that allow you to do things that you can offline,4
It's amazing,5
Great,5
"Now that the softlock is gone, I can enjoy this game, and it's been amazing, so, thanks.",5
"Fun, but controls are a bit anoying.",4
Really fun action rpg mobile game I just wish the summon rates were higher,5
I like the game alot the characters the graphics the gameplay I just wish there was a bit more like try adding a pvp or a large raid or something not trying to change the game or anything just saying also it's be nice if u added more characters plz and thank u,5
Great game.,5
The game is fun and very well though out,5
A combination of world building and dungeon crawling mixed with a decent storyline. I think that this game is definitely worth a try if you're looking for something new.,5
It's a fun game. Good work=),5
"This game is Amazing! Download this NOW!!! It's FTP friendly, music is catchy, characters are cute and gameplay is simple but has complex elements for those who love jrpg's. Co-op is super fun! Play this with friends or random players from all over the world.",5
It feels so much like an old style JRPG. And the music and tone have you feel like your apart of some sort of anime. I would give it a shot!,5
The controls when moving the character is a little funky and can take a bit to get used to,4
I love the game. It's fun to play when you need to relax and the little comics they have is a nice touch.,5
Way too much downloading. Completely killed the flow of the game.,2
A fun mobile game to pass the time.,5
Sound 5 Graphics 4 Entertainment 4.5 Controls 3.5 Gacha rates 4,4
"I think this is the only phone game I'll be playing for a while. It's cool that there's cutscenes and voice acting. It's also cool that it's basically like a playable, fantasy anime. Nintendo did well. I'm not far enough in to see if I have to pay for the rest of the story, but if it is then it will definitely be worth buying just to keep playing.",5
"It plays similar to Secret of Mana. Fun JRPG story keeps it light-hearted. 1.72 GB to download after an initial 650 MB one to keep in mind if you want to play. The game also requires internet to play which is a total bummer but it's how they're doing it. Decent, but I would check out Monster Hunter Stories for a genuine RPG experience. MHS also has DRM during game launch however just FYI.",4
This game is addictive and it is really amazing of the I like the graphics of the running animation combat animation and even more and the summoning section it looks really amazing. I hope you guys work very hard for more game to come in the future.,5
"Fantastic Nintendo style rpg. The controls are easy to use, game runs smoothly, the story is good and sweet. Never feels as though you have to spend money on it, plenty of option to obtain items in game. Highly reccomend!",5
SO MANY WAIFUS WITH SUCH GOOD STORYLINES,5
Dragon power!!!,5
Good,5
Good game Reminds me of Blue Dragon for the 360,5
"It's fun and different, controls are responsive and it's hard to put this game down. A little tedious to make better weapons, but over time it will come easy.",5
Fun looks good compared too others like it,5
"I like it, but I find myself wishing the levels were a bit longer. I haven't played a lot yet so not sure if they are later. Also really would like to be able to play holding the device horizontally rather than virtically. Other than that its pretty good.",4
Great story,5
Real Talk. Just download it is great. No disappointments. Not everything is perfect :),4
"Really well made, fun storyline.",5
This game is amazing,5
Cool,5
Mym is thiccc,4
Fun game well put together,5
"SCAM ALERT! I made an in-app purchase and didn't receive what I paid for. I now have a $39.99 charge on my credit card and nothing to show for it. I submitted a support ticket, but it's been ignored by the developer to date.",1
Good games gud characters,5
"I love this game. When I saw it was from Nintendo, I Downloaded it right away. I love every aspect of this game. I love that we can change the player name at any time. The controls. the graphics, this game is phenomenal! I love animé. And I love video games. So the two together, is way awesome. An Animé video game is definitely for me. I love playing Dragalia Lost. It has become one of my new favorite mobile games. I have a few others I play as well. I love playing Kingdom Hearts Unchained_[X], and I have a few Final Fantasy and Pokémon games on my phone too. These are basically animé games too.",5
I think the game is pretty dope I've been playing it since its release so far I haven't ran into any problems that I can notice to the naked eye overall I think it's a good RPG only thing I would say is that all the dragons need to be big dragons and not baby ones,5
Hot girl,5
Large download but worth it in the long run.,3
Love this game and the team behind it make strides every week to make it even better!,5
"Movement is a little strange but the game, its perfect as a phone game",5
Good game,5
Good game,5
Nice,5
"Just another great game ruined by over expensive gatcha. If you like to spend literally 32 dollars for a .5% for a character then go for it you will definitely love it. As for me, gameplay and all seems good for mobile. The story while cheezy works for me and the design of characters are a bit subpar. All in all while the game offers some free rewards it still doesn't make it up for the insane price and gatcha. I will keep playing it because is fun and I was super close to give some money but no way in heaven or hell I will give up 32 dollars for a chance on a phone game, what the hell is going wrong with nintendo who is the guy that thought 32 dollars was a fair value for gatcha?????",3
Always love a great JRPG,5
"One of my favorite mobile games to date. I usually get bored after the first week but there is always something fresh and new to do and characters are so loveable. The fact they have a story for each character including the dragons makes it worth raising each of them to find out more about them. Keep up the great work team, this is a hell of a game.",5
Best mobile game IMO. Great and generous devs. One of the best gaming soundtracks ever. Fun events. This game has it all.,5
I loathe the controls. Everything about the game is good except for it being on a phone.,3
"I, personally, love it. After a long uninstall and reinstall, it APPEARS to be working. I'll test it more thoroughly later, but as promised, back to 5 stars.",5
Heyyyyy! Thats preety gooooood!,5
"Changed my 2 star ratings to 5, the quickly fixed the server and connectivity issues, it's still a little wonky at times, but this game heavily outweighs it's cons with it's pros, play it. It may drag a little in the beginning but it's fun making your team stronger. Edit: Changed 5 stars to one. Nobody is playing I've been trying to co-op master imperial assault (common challenge) and there are no rooms, and I'm stuck with these limited feathers. Plus it gets boring after a month.",1
I can't say how much I enjoy this game. Gameplay is good and intriguing keeping me drawn in. Sound track sounds amazing. Great game and truely worth trying.,5
Gacha,4
"I love this game so much!! Beautiful dragons, voice acting, and graphics! And super fun gameplay!! I don't even care if it's a gacha game, this is so fun!",5
Awesome game,5
Love the game the dragons are awsome,5
Great,5
Great game,5
"Issue fixed, thanks, a great game honestly keep up the good work, looking forward to seeing updates and more events",4
So much fun and so addictive! It has great controls for a mobile game and I never felt the need to pay real money!,5
Awesome,5
It's awesome!,5
Great game well done,5
"This is a fun, enjoyable game with amazing events!",5
This game is so fun,5
"Amazing, voice acting is great best i have seen in a mobile game. The only thing that is bad is lag with graffics set on high. But if turned down it preforms well.",4
Get this one of a kind JRPG from Nintendo and Cygames right now!,5
"Great game and awesome soundtrack. The storyline is intriguing as well. Only concern is that you may need a lot of space to play and download extra content. Other then that, you should find this game enjoyable.",5
Fun,5
Awsome just awsome.,5
It's fun to play it may cost wifi buts it worth it,5
This game is great and I cant tell you how many hours I've spent on it.,5
ITS INCREDIBLE! The visuals are amazing and each character is unique in both looks and personality!,5
"The game, advertised to hell by Nintendo, is pretty polished as expected. The graphics are good, art is beautiful, music is catchy, and gameplay matches what you'd expect from a Gacha game. Overall, considering what it was intended to be, they nailed it.",4
Good game,5
The controls are a bit Wonky but I love the story and characters characters,5
Fun and immersive,5
It's the greatest game yet this year,5
Good,5
Well polished. Great music score. I put a few bucks in it but you really don't have too. Its freaking Nintendo! Just play it.,5
Gatcha madness,5
Awesome game,5
That my fav game,5
Im am addicted to this game.... that is all,5
"Great. I enjoy the combat. The story is pretty standard for a jrpg but besides that, pretty good.",5
The controls were good and the graphics were likable,5
"It's very fun, but takes up a lot of space. If you have a spare 2 gb of storage, I highly recommend it.",5
This game is good at the start but it became boring a few weeks later,3
I like dragons,5
TIME KILLER it's good for a time killer and I want more games just like this one,5
I love everything about this game,5
Great game. Expected from Nintendo.,5
The game is awesome the control r alittle weird for running around. Need analog stick would work better,5
"Simply put, I really love this game!",5
It keeps saying that it failed to function when I try to play it you need to fix that man,5
Boku no favorite part about it are the graphics and the 2D modeling of the characters in the game.,5
Yessssssss,5
Cute and fun. Wish controls were better,5
Awsome,5
Love this game can't wait to see more characters and DRAGONS. :-),5
So awesome. Keeps me playing everyday!,5
Coool,5
All the dragons,5
Very enjoyable,4
"Dragalia has a little bit of everything for people who play mobile, auto play, castle or empire construction, RPG format, Dragons and its not as money hungry as other games.",5
Great game,5
Little awkward to move. Otherwise its great,4
"For any fan of anime, this is the game for you.",5
Dope yo,4
"I absitively, posolutely love, love, LOVE this game! I've played a handful of games just like this but there's something special... something that sets this game apart from others that I can't quite pinpoint. Oh wait! Yes I can!! Maybe it could be that you can transform into a wide variety of dragons during battle sequences! Or maybe it is the upbeat jpop music (especially the raid battle one, my fav)! Or perhaps it could he the interactive 16-character co-op battles (4 players with 4 characters each) that run exceptionally smooth! Let's see... It has a growing castle system for farming items/currency... A bonding system with your dragons.. and of course you have the typical character/weapon/accessory enhance and evolve system that all RPGs have. There's more but no need to bore you with the deets. Don't wanna take away time you could be downloading and checking this awesome game out for yourself! Take it from a long time gamer who's picky about her games and usually prefers turn based RPGs; can't go wrong here. ✓",5
"Overall pretty great game, gives you plenty of in-game currency and don't really have to spend a dime to enjoy. I mean if you really want to boost your team quicker, but even then still takes time build up your base and upgrades. So it doesn't promote super whaling, which is nice.",5
Too many updates,2
"This is a really fun and addictive game, you should try it out, it's worth it.",5
Cool story,5
"Do you want a game you can sink time into? This is it, its not REMARKABLE in any area but it is SOLID in many.",5
Yea its fun,5
"Been playing non-stop since it came out and the best rpg hands down only thing it needs is pvp, keep up the good work. No clue why it's not rated 5 stars also considering how many people co-op",5
An rpg with just enough action to stop fights from being repetitive,5
Really good game. I like the characters but wish some of the voice acting was better.,5
"This game is amazing . The graphics, music, and the characters. Haven't played something this awesome in a while. And to the dev team thank you for being on top of all the bugs and gifts in game we appreciate it.",5
Dope,5
Fun game. Hope they keep adding interesting characters and content.,5
Won't even start. Keeps saying that it needs an update but there is no new update to add.,1
"Good game, terrible draw rates. Reroll for a good start",5
Awesome,5
"The game is good, runs smoothly, the graphics are fantastic. While it can be played on data wifi is recommended or you may get longer loading times and some lag I will say controlling characters is a bit frustrating and could use some fine tuning. Perhaps the ability for a character to switch to an enemy that you click. Often times my character will attack an enemy further away than the one I'm clicking close by. I also like that you don't have to spend money in the game. I did spend 5 bucks but it's fully playable without micro transactions. It's a great little game to pass the time",5
Not bad,3
Fun once you get used to the odd controls.,4
Event quest still glitched cant progress,5
Can't play because it needs an update that I can't see a button for....sad it looked promising.,1
it is a good game and i don't know why it has a low rating,5
This game is lit Highly recommend,5
"Nintendo and Cygames have answered my prayers for a new gatcha to sink my wallet into. Simple and fun gameplay, great UI, great ost, and waifus galore. Also dragons. What else could you ask for?",5
"The control was quite hard to pull, need to dash em to move precisely. But overall liked it.",3
Having to download before everything you do in this game is garbage.,1
I like to play with my family and friends,5
Best gacha game ever. Game wont update for the Halloween event though and its making me sad.,5
"Very fun, charming and addicting! Devs are very active in improving the game based on feedback from the community.",5
(Edit: since the fixes game works better and i give it 5 stars because its good now wonderfulnto play) I was hyped very hyped for the game and i still think it can be good im giving nintendo and cygames a chance to fix and redeem themselves right now im facing the same bug as others the co-op glitch and it sucks to because i really enjoyed the game i was gonna roll a 10x again but im disappointed that. This bug happened in the freaking tutorial like guys cmon im sure u tested the game before releasing it this is unacceptable please fix it so i can give 5 stars (ps: add a joystick as well the controls are annoying),5
"I really like the game, but for some reason it keeps interrupting gameplay by closing and bringing me back to this screen... I think I am going to uninstall it then reinstall, if it still does it then in going to have to give up on it for now. Perhaps it's a bug or something?",5
"The rates could have been better but if each new summoning comes with a free 10 summons it's not that bad, will be a 5 stars after bug fixes on imperial usually",4
Really fun. Reminds me of Granblue Fantasy a lot which is a very good thing in my book.,5
"Over all great game to play daily, so far a lot of content",5
Good game nice music,5
Super fun and really liking the art style and stories,5
"Great gacha, just super bad controls in-game. I dislike the joystick",5
Awesome great story ^_^,5
Really good JRPG story with a nice chibi JRPG art style. Kinda grindy to get high end weapons. Fair gacha system. No need spend money to earn summons.,5
I feel like this game deserves a better score than 3.6 the game is actually very cool and fun,5
Basically a clicker with how much you tap the screen.,2
Overall quite fun and interesting.,5
Beautiful game the music is on point and it's defiantly fun,5
Love this New game. It's a new game but I find it easy to understand and playing it is fun. Lots of options with different playing fields Story is good and entertaining.,5
love it,5
"The game is over all very fun once you make it through the first chapter or two. This is the first mobile game to actually make me care about the story. The gameplay is very simple at first. Eventually, you unlock up to 3 special attacks, a charge attack, basic attack, and a dragon transformation that also has its own special attack. On top of that, there is a gacha to get new characters, dragons, and equipment. Speaking of characters, they can all be leveled up, made more powerful with equipment, and upgraded both in rarity and abilities. Each character in the game has unlockable episodes that tells you about them and their history. There is a base building mechanic that lets you increases your damage, generate resources, improve your blacksmith, and increase the efficiency of your dragons. This game mixes and matches different mobile mechanics but it all works well together. The story is what hooked me but the event is what sold me. The event contained a unique character, dragon, and equipment item. You play through the story and multiple levels until you hit a boss level and a raid boss. By farming them you not only get xp but also great rewards. Everytime you beat a boss you earn medals. Earning a certain amount of a certain type of medal unlocked rewards. You also got summoning vouchers to pull from a large pot of rewards. I managed to get the exclusive character and fully unbind the 5 star exclusive dragon, Pele, after only playing the event for a few days. Did I mention the Raid Boss is a multiplayer challenge? You fight the raid boss with 4 other people and their 4 man parties. I had a real blast and can't wait for the next event. I really love this game!",5
Nice good story,5
"Doesnt deserve the rough reviews it's gotten. Really solid game, great graphics, good story, plus dragons!",5
It's fun for what it is. I'm going to keep playing cause the character are fun and game play is like a super mini Diablo like game. So it's good for now,4
"The downloads are annoying, I was so eager to play the game but i had to download things twice, and realized it got a bit boring for waiting so long. I actually REALLY LOVED the game, but the downloading is what made my uninstall this game.",3
The leveling system is bad,3
"Fantastic writing and Characters are combined with a gameplay loop that isn't overly grindy, but still rewards effort and diligence!",5
Best game ever love it,5
"You out did this, I'm surprise it has all good visuals and is actually a game",5
Get it Nintendo!,5
Well its got a good story and fun. Just try it! Only way u will truly know if u like it.,5
It's Grindblue except with action combat. Game gets fairly difficult after chapter 5.,5
Really good game I enjoy it a lot Cool characters along with the voice acting absolutely flawless along with the music in the menu and the boss battles,5
This is literally the best mobile game of all time and if you disagree then I respect your right to have an incorrect opinion.,5
Gatcha Life,5
"Don't let the average ratings fool you, it's mostly people who don't understand what a gacha game is getting mad at the concept. Though Dragalia has a few little rough edges which I hope to see smoothed out in the future, it's a fun ARPG gacha game with a surprising amount of content for a game that was just released. The music is great too.",5
Love the game wish there were better controls than just the tap ones a dpad and attack button would be great,5
"Horrible programming skill, everything is so slow and laggy, controls are horrible too like the character will randomly move backward, level design is also awful",1
One of the best phone games I have played. Download it now!,5
"At surface level just another mobile gacha game. I mean that basically is all it is but it has that nintendo charm. Slick graphics and great artwork and characters bursting with personality. Would definitely recommend. (Review from a free to play player, if that matters to you)",5
Loving this game so far,5
"Good storyline, but the time that you unlock weapon upgrades and such is a bit later than expected.",4
"I love the game but I suggest to the developers can you guys make the auto stay on? Like a game bleach brave souls, if you auto on a stage, when you load into a new stage the auto stays on, this would help.",5
"The movement controls a bit irritating when I'm trying to turn it just finds a new starting point and then I just dash off into a different direction. But other than that it's a good game, though I wish there were more dark skinned cute girls to play, sigh...",4
I enjoy playing this game. Co op with friends is awesome,5
"Great fun, decent story. And grindable for those who don't want to pay.",5
You must grind. Live the grind.,5
Boi,5
It's a gacha game... but a very polished gacha game,4
Good waifus,5
One of the better more interactive gatcha games I have played.Greats characters love the co-op features.,5
Legitimately surprised how high quality it is for a gacha and I usually hate gacha games. An actual 3D ARPG that's not some turn based 2D sprite game like FEH or Fate Go,5
Fun,4
Rates are pretty low but not biggest issue. Some bugs but the developers are working on them and the co-op events were fun for me.,4
"This is game is alright, but in desperate need of a few gameplay implementations. There is no form of in-game chat or guild system, and both of these are definitely needed. The rest of the game is very fun with an enjoyable story line, and a simple but decent combat system. With a decent amount of content from the begging or is worth a try l. Hopefully they will at least add in-game chat later as this is the biggest thing that prevents the game from ever being more than 3 stars.",3
"So much fun, I can't put it down. Lots of good story and fun exciting gameplay.",5
"Massive game. But its mostly just a game that never stops updating. Installed the game, then waited for a 1.8gb update to complete for the first adventure. Afterwards, I had to wait for another update to play the first prologue mission. I started it up again today, only downloading it a day earlier, and now I have a full new update that has to download. In all, I've downloaded near 3gb of game data, but haven't played for more than 2 minutes.",3
Love it !,5
"A lot of players to choose and use, it's 3d fire emblem heroes",5
"Wonderful, impressive team play mode",5
I like dragons,5
"This is what a proper well made free to play rpg should look like. There is a grind, you can bypass it, but it's not stop tedious as to be annoying. The game play during the grind is fun and the game feels like it was made with passion and not just a cynical cash grab. I also don't think I've seen any ads so far which is refreshing. Deserves all the praise it's gotten.",5
Fun game.,5
Great game so nostalgic,5
Great story. Really keeps you immersed.,5
I played the first part and so far it's pretty darn fun,5
Best phone game yet,5
Great time killer. Leveling up is kinda tedious,5
Love Nintendo and love Cygames. Cant ask for more,5
"Not too P2W, and pretty decent rates. Overall a good gacha game.",5
There was a glitch that prevents you from getting past the co-op tutorial and it's fixed!!! I'm having a blast now!!,5
It's got a stamina system which isn't that surprising. The combat is kind of fun with some challenges to it. So far fun but have only been playing an hour,5
Best,5
"Amazing game, really fun so far",5
"Fun game, and doesnt require cash purchases. Game progresses well and pushes towards online play at a casual pace.",5
"Although it has a harsh gotcha , the style and coop aspects of the game have kept me hooked.",5
"Controls weird, but it's good. Nice music too.",4
"I can't see why people would give this game bad reviews. Its thematically perfection. The characters diff from one another, developers are responsive to the player base and has constant updates for that reason, events are a blast with tons of rewards, etc. Its still a new game and its heading towards the right direction. This one is a sleeper app in my opinion.",5
"This game is amazing. Great story, characters, such a fun, fun game with a ton of heart",5
Reminds me of bravely default. By the company who did rage of bahamut!,5
"Great characters and mechanics, doesn't straddle you too much for stamina, and the devs so far have been quite generous, especially with compensating players for oversights and other such issues. The story is predictable but has that certain corny Nintendo charm in the writing.",5
"Solid mobile game, Cygames and Nintendo has done well with player feedback to take the game to the next level.",5
Cool,5
"It's an addicting game! Beautiful graphics, exciting music, fun storylines. The only issue I have is the clunky controls which they are fixing in the new update anyway.",5
It's a fun game that combines simple hack-n-slash with the aspects of Final Fantasy XIV and Granblue Fantasy while being cute on top of that. I hope to see where this game heads in the future.,5
Love this game,5
One of the better games I've played recently.,5
This app goes hard,5
Pretty fun with friends and cygames is generous with free stuff,4
"It isn't completely my style but i'm sure I'm not alone with that, but that's completely alright because for the game that it is, It's very fun and this is only the start!",5
"Good adventure with well paced action rpg gameplay, engaging story and warm unlockable character moments. Generous gacha rates make free to play very viable. Touch controls were buggy including charge moves being very difficult to trigger or aim. Multiplayer frequently drops connection during play and team creation room. Limited stamina and very diverse upgrade requirements make for a daily grind but developer compensation stamina restoration items keep coming in.",4
"The running controlsngetbfrustrating when trying to turn, but also getting a 5star adventurer is really difficult",4
Good,5
White cat project...,5
fun and engaging co-op gacha game from veterans of the genre cygames. it's cute and the soundtrack is perfect,5
This is by far the best mobile rpg ever!,5
"Yes, this is a gacha game so it can be frustrating to not pull what you want after sinking money in. Don't let that deter you, though. This has that Nintendo polish that you can expect from the company paired with an active developer in Cygames that is constantly fixing things. Gameplay is easy to pick up and fun enough that not pulling top-tier units/dragons/wyrmprints shouldn't get you down. Dragalia easily took over my ""most played"" mobile game spot.",5
Bunch of casuals calling this boring and hard to play. It's not. It's really fun and easy to play if you know how be good at dodging.,5
Very polished gacha game with a bright future.,5
fun game!,5
"Lovely graphics, good optimazation, and it's fun! Lots of events.",5
Gave in and finally downloaded this game only to find that it needs an update the same day I downloaded it. However it won't update and so I can't play this game.,1
"Great story and gameplay compared to most mobile games as an ARPG. The multiplayer feature is the best in it's field. Please compare apples to apples, guys. This is not pokemon.",5
"Been Playing 2 weeks now, highly recommend! Awesome game play and graphics, Only thing that bothers me is there isn't a joy stick for better control but definitely 8/10☆☆☆☆",5
"I see all these bad reviews talking about the gachon % and the story line is lame and how its repetitive. But for .me I was able to get a special summon ×10 and I got 2 5 star dragons and a bunch bunch of awesome characters and wyrmprints. I love the story line and the layout of the whole game and if you think about it every single game is somewhat repetitive, some more then others. The only proble. I have with the the game is the controls. But other then that great game.",5
Nintendo needs to make this a Chrystal Chronicles type for console,5
Great game Nintendo!! Great game,5
"This game is easy to play and it's music alone and keeping me playing, good thing the game is fun too!",5
"Its what you would expect from Nintendo, real good",5
It's a gatcha game that keeps you coming back for more.,5
Dope game but you screwed us over not being able to fight the boss on the last event.,5
Pretty fun has a lot of bugs tho,5
Is pretty good very anime,5
"Fun and smooth gameplay, good artistic style, and good developer interaction/response to issues",5
"Great game, really friendly towards new players.",5
Good characters and looks amazing! I don't usually play these kind of games but I love this one! Highly recommend!,5
"The story is interesting, the graphics are wonderful, game play is good, it's grindy but I like grinds.",5
Great game but would rather a d-pad,5
"Fun, generous and polished. It's a gacha game, but it feels like what a lot of games should be like in terms of character detail and value. Everyone had a story",5
It's pretty fun game,5
"This game has such a rich story. The art is well done. Gameplay is easy, yet fun.",5
"Fantastic game, especially If you enjoy GBF or FGO",5
Awesome game love it,5
The first phone game I've properly stuck with.,5
Lots of fun!,5
Amazing story and character depth. Played 4 hours straight before realizing it,5
"The graphics are wonderful and the story is straightforward and enjoyable. Gameplay is a basic gacha style, but enough reload items are provided free by playing often. Co-op is spotty at best, so I'm only giving 4 stars (nintendo is unfortunately known for internet services being lackluster)",4
"OMG!!! This is the mobile RPG I have waited for my entire life! Cuteness overload! Great story! Super well balanced, PERFECT SOUNDTRACK! pure love! Thank you to all developers!",5
"This game tells an amazing story with interesting, fleshed out characters. The controls are a bit hard to get used to, but the gameplay underneath is simple and fun to play with friends.",5
"Incredibly polished for a mobile game. A bit of overhead to get started, but well worth it.",5
"It is like playing Fire Emblem Heroes, but with lots of dungeons, and big boss battles.",5
Very stand alone for the genre amazing,5
Great time killer. Best gacha game out there!,5
Wonderful game,5
One word. AMAZING.,5
Best mobile game i ever played :D 💚💚💚,5
Pretty all right. Nothing groundbreaking or innovative but fun and enjoyable. Decent gatcha rates which is important,4
This game is great. People are just stupid. Play it.,5
Great phone game high marks to the developers,5
Amazing everything! Always looking forward to playing it!,5
"Well I like the game a lot but I am having a problem. After I finished chaper 2/2:1 I was brought to a tutorial for the event ""avenue to power"".I have to select co-op and create a match then it gets stuck loading. I would love to play the game more but I am unable too.",5
Good,5
Mmm rpg,5
I am not fond of those who rated this poorly just because they got jebaited. This is a fine game and better than most of the higher rated things. What an outrage culture.,5
First things first: all the bad reviews are probably 90% salty people that have horrible gacha luck. Now for my review. Absolutely cute fun and addictive. It's almost like a mix of a few mobile games put into one. Developers seem to be very interested in our feedback. Characters get interesting from back story through dialogue from getting their adventurer stories and Dragons have back stories too. Music is top notch and some are really catchy. Story is intriguing and cant wait for more.,5
"Nice game, just too much luck",5
Ye,5
Best rpg,5
"This is just another brave frontier type of game, but with more customization, more interactive gameplay, and more playtime. I never felt pressured to pay for stuff and get a lot of playtime even though it has a energy bar. This game stands out against the rest, especially with it co op multiplayer (lobby's can take awhile sometimes). I am running on android with very minor issues. The weekly and almost daily updates keep me looking forward down the line. The roster is only 65 characters but I cant wait to see it grow to a 200+ in the near future.",4
"You can read any other review and that would be my reason for thinking its bad because most people I've seen have gripes about how the the story is nothing you haven't seen before (unless you haven't watched anime). The controllers are nothing innovative but are pretty bad when it comes to changing direction, I feel a regular D-pad or joy stick like controls would've suited the game better. The levels feel a bit empty and boring and you feel like you're doing the same thing with nothing new coming to play until the next chapter. Even the bosses at the end of each level in a single level are just variations of each other. The gacha system was set up poorly as there is a chance to obtain cards, adventurers, and dragons within the same gacha and not only does that bring down your chance of getting someone good for your team, the rates are just terrible in general. If you see you obtained a 5-star it's most likely just a card. Small things regarding how characters unequip items when you remove them from your team and how the kingdom building aspect also feels unneeded. For the pros the music is phenomenal If you've ever watches the shingeki no bahamut series you will notice the the outtro for the 2nd season ""cinderella step"" is used as the menus theme occasionally and a bit of an Easter egg but the dragon statue in the back when tour character is in his castle I think is a statue of bahamut from that one scene where nina met her ""dad"" at night. In those two aspects this appeals to fans of the series but other than music this game has basically nothing going for it Dont let the Nintendo tag fool you, it's a mediocre game at best.",1
"Simple gacha game with plenty of charm. The community is helpful, along with plenty of reasons to come back to the game with updates coming out every week!",5
"While nothing new, it's still a great RPG that incorporates the best parts of that genre into its story and gameplay. PROS: (1) story mode, (2) daily quests, (3) amazing graphics and design, (4) music (very addictive), (5) voice acting, (6) combat mechanics, (7) co-op, and (8) unique and fleshed out characters. CONS: (1) poor summoning rates, (2) lots of grinding, and (3) low stamina meter and wings (which is used to determine how many quests you can do in a day). Overall, this is a light-hearted, feel-good game that offers a lot of content that'll keep you occupied for a while.",4
Loving the game for now,5
Great and beautiful,5
I love this game bro,5
"Super simple controls, colorful game, neat characters!",5
"A fun game with an easy to jump into battle system. Pay to win isnt a thing when everything is co-op, and running content with friends is an absolute blast. Text has some issues, but it is an excellent beginning into this title! I hope to see it continue to grow in popularity and with its cast!",5
Well I'm having problems with the graphics and basically can only see dark black silhouettes instead of colorful 3d models. So other than that the game is ok.,4
GOOOOOOD,5
Nice job Cygames,5
"The game is quite fun and the art and graphics are great! Controls take some time to get used to but their also simple. You auto target so thankfully aim isn't needed. Voice acting for both English and Japanese is really, really good! I'm actually surprised that there was English voice acting since so many mobile games just have Japanese. I'm bad at making reviews but I do recommend this game! It's fun!:)",5
First skill based gacha game I have ever played. The game is balanced around skill and you do not need to spend a dime to fully enjoy and clear all of the games content. Highly recommend.,5
Plenty of ideas likeable characters and gameplay with just enough.,5
"Game is definitely good, although the controls are a bit, odd. Other than that, I play it daily",5
Awesome and engaging with colorful characters and fantastic music.,5
like the game f2p friendly,4
"Excellent game, quality localization",5
"Cool, good job Nintendo",5
"Best gacha game I played in awhile and if more content is dumped into this game, plenty of more hours i will put into it!",5
AD ON TO NINTENDO SWICH,5
This game is fun because you have your team with you,5
Would not work at all.,1
"Essentially action rpg version of granblue, very well executed. Devs listen to feedback and compensate for anything at fault, this is how a game achieves longevity.",5
Great so far,5
"I really want to like this game, as when I get to play it I actually have fun. The problem is all the things preventing me from actually playing the game. The whole ""might"" system needs a rework, since it has turned into the exact elitism it was likely designed to prevent. Especially since you have no limits on who can join rooms, and automatic matching just throws in whoever with no respect for having similar strength. This has made the current event very difficult to play without using an outside communication tool to coordinate private rooms and matchmaking since you will be flooded with people using elements the boss is strong against or will have 1/10th of the required level. Not only this but the energy system is wonky. The game is multiplayer heavy, but you have two different stamina bars: One for single-player and hosting and another for Joining another player's multiplayer game. This was decently balanced before the first event dropped, but with the event it has become horribly balanced. Players are disincetivized from joining multiplayer games because of how expensive it (relatively) is from hosting, so everyone is hosting and waiting, meaning no one is playing.",4
It's a ok rpg,4
"Excellent game all around. Great gameplay, surprisingly good writing and story, generous with f2p rewards and currency.. DL is shaping up to be a genre defining game.",5
I love it fun to play just needs to add guilds and more way to get 4 stars to 5 stars and such tweaks,5
Super fun game and a cut above the rest. Cant wait to see it grow!,5
"Fun gacha game with really fun co-op. So far it's been very f2p friendly, with the rarer units being nice to have but not necessary.",5
I like,5
"The game is very enjoyable, it does require quite a lot of space though.",5
"Pretty solid action gameplay, the real fun is in coop/raid content. Pretty generous with in game currency, but still your stereotypical gacha system with all the negatives those typically bring to the table.",5
"Very fun, and one of the best soundtracks in gaming.",5
It's a pretty good game and people who are throwing a frenzy about gacha style format; they give you free heroes and the starter heroes are up to par to handle any late game content. The p2w aspect is in how much you can play and progress because of recharging which is fair. Quality is great and devs care A LOT about us. Don't listen to the low scores. I usually hate mobile games but this is a job well done.,5
I couldn't play the game because it to too long to load and it made my phone over heat and it almost exploded,1
"Generous with starting out, especially if you want to reroll for 5* gameplay is simple yet very engaging. Systems for upgrading are varied enough but none feel too unattainable. Game has very fair pulls compared to FG/O, Dx2, and other mobage on the play store. Art, music, and characters are charming and fun. I personally don't enjoy the VA so I have voices turned off but thats a personal thing. Download it, and stick around for a good game.",5
Amazing game,5
Super addicting! Great customer service as well! Devs on point with fixing things,5
"Been waiting for a game like this! Been playing since I downloaded it. Cute characters, awesome game play, amazing music.",5
Great game. Great story. Not too scummy gatcha. Great devs.,5
"This game is all looks but no content. The game and its interface look amazing and its so neat to navigate, but that's not why you play games for is it. The actual gameplay is super wonky, with controls for movement feeling way too 'lose' and combat ones feeling heavy, as you're forced to commit to combos. That's without even mentioning the blatant rip off that the gacha system is. Do yourself a favor and invest on something else, because although it's free to download, it sure isn't free to play.",1
"Love the game so far and the Dev communication, music, art style and combat, they even hear suggestions and work hard and fast to make fix or implement them",5
"Does many things right while staying fun with updates, incredible soundtrack and visuals and great support in general.",5
The rating on this game is bad but this is one of the best gotcha game I've played 5* for me,5
"When it comes to turning your character it can be a bit hard to do no matter the sensitivity, other wise the game is really fun",5
"The graphics are fun, but the gameplay was kind of broken. Sometimes the little cutscenes get off sync with the dialog and gets really slow at times. But I only made it through the tutorial phase when the games asks me to download a full gig to actually get to the real part if the game... The game looks fun and all, but for low-end device users like me can get a bit frustrated with the Storage issue that's basically a paywall... I suggest that you should add a low storage mode, or even a lite version for those users that cant even afford the space.",3
Great,5
It's awesome. Game runs great.,5
"Lots of fun, Gacha rates and currency are kinda bad, but the game itself is pretty top notch and fun",5
It's fun and it has a good story which surprise me,5
It's a fun game.,5
"Enjoyed the main campaign, looking forward to seeing how this game progresses with future updates!!!",5
This game shouldve came out for the nintendo switch man. Its really fun.,5
"This has been one of the best games I have ever played on mobile. Compared to other similar games, Dragalia Lost helps you step by step to make sure you understand every component of the game.",5
Seems fun so far.,5
Dragalia lost is a great game theirs a lot of memorable characters a good story it's fun it didn't lose my interest like fire emblem heroes,5
Nintendo hits another home run.,5
"This game takes some time to get used to but once you get used to it, Dragalia Lost can become very addictive, so you like finger scrolling, screen tapping, unit summing & baddy butt kicking adventures. Then I would say give this game a try hands down.",4
This is easily the most predatory mobile game I've played. If Nintendo wants to retain their family-friendly image they should probably stop trying to get kids addicted to gambling.,2
Praise Cygames. A thrilling action packed adventure with lovable characters for everyone's taste.,5
"A lot of ppl complain about either the summon rates (i agree with) but that's not something to give this game a 1 star for. They also complain about the AI, please realize this game is still new so ofc theres things to fix and improve.",4
Didn't matter how much space i had just kept saying not enough,1
This game is awesome and challenging. Love the different characters and all of them are usable in there own way.,5
"Beautiful game, lots of fun",5
"It's really exactly what I expected from the game, which would have been alright if I didn't already have my expectations set pretty low. Controls are super eh, the music is alright, the gacha system is terrible, even if you spend money, and some of the stuff isn't helpful at all. Story is boring and repetitive, which is what I expected, and while there are ways to look into how deep a character is, the method of getting there is incredibly slow and grindy. There are a lot of quality of life things you can do in the game (like bulk downloading all of the story maps at once), but there are plenty of things they don't tell you about at all that really ruins the experience if all you want to do is jump right in and start playing. Wyrmite is only obtainable in-game and is used only for summoning, while Diamantium is bought with microtransactions and is the universal currency, which is stupid considering the exchange rate for summons are the same for both. Overall, terrible gacha, and the rest is less than desirable.",2
People just hating cuz they cant get their units,5
Gotta catch em all,5
"Game is great, don't let reviews deceive you. Gameplay is boring to start but once you dive in the gameplay becomes challenging and engaging",5
Grate game the only thing i wish they had was a d-pad as an option but outher than that love it,5
"Bit grindy, and movement is sometimes weird, but the game is really fun, and one of the movement issues is getting fixed.",4
"I'm having fun with the game so far. Nice graphics and music. I am really enjoying all the backstories with the heros and dragons. I have noticed that sometimes the movement controls are off. It's not a deal breaker for me, but hopefully they can smooth that out with the next patch or two.",5
"It's a really great game, especially for a freemium. The only problem I have with it is the control can be a bit awkward, particularly for the focus attack. A button for that would be great.",4
"The game is so addicting, I can't stop playing it!!!!",5
It's honestly addictive ones you see your team begin to grow stronger👌,5
Charming story and a great time killer,5
"I absolutely love this game, on top of loving everything about it though, bless the developers, because I rarely see anyone so willing to listen to critique, and be so generous. This game will be something I play for a very long time to come, and I love every second of it.",5
"I love the game but I have four bones to pick... of them are probably my device: first bone, sprites( characters, barrels, chests and such are black on the field). Second the game is downloading ALL the time...bulk downloading is fine but why not just finish the downloading all at once. Third, I suffer from disconnections 60% of the time. Fourth, the random ctds are nuts. 5* if you fix at least two of those things....the black sprites I can deal with, but the ctds and disconnects are game killer.",3
This is a good game other than the fact I haven't been able to play for 3 days because of the Co Op tutorial glitch where it doesn't bring me into a game and makes me load for wasted hours on end. Really was looking forward to the game.,4
yeehaw,5
"AWESOME GAME!! I'm having a lot of fun with this game. It also helps that this game is very generous with its cash currency that you can earn by simply playing the game (they give 10x summon vouchers away for free at the start of new events too). Thank you to the developers for that! I love interacting with my characters, developing their stories, feeding my dragons, and seeing bonding with them! This game has revitalized my enthusiasm to play mobile games. Criticisms: the controls need fine-tuning. Some gestures for attacks (force strikes) get picked up as movements by the game and it can really get you killed mid-fight, especially against tough bosses. Not just that; I can't run and steer my character without him completely dodge rolling in a direction I did not intend. Please fix these problems, developers. It would make this game PERFECT (for me)!!",5
"It's a fine game. I had fun, but I didn't play long. The story is decent, but the gameplay is pretty repeative.",3
Big Gay Would recommend 4/7,4
A wonderful game.,5
Game takes too long to load sometimes. Overall it's a great game!,5
Beautiful game with a great overarching story. The best part are the individual character stories!,5
One of the better mobile games I've played.,5
This game is super fun and addictive. Play for hours. One thing though am i the only one that somtimes have trouble with the loading screen in co-op or event. I have to exit the game to play,5
"It's fun, good job cygames",5
Great art work and good co-op system,5
Fantastic game that has quickly become my favorite on mobile.,5
Best game,5
Im enjoying it~,5
Love this game so far....,5
Very engaging and holds your attention for a long time.,5
"What a deep and complex game! Love it for all, I mean ALL of the features",5
It's a fun grinding game. Far better controls and depth than any other action mobile gacha game I've played so far.,5
"The best gacha game I've played yet. Cygames has been very generous and have listened to everyone's complaints and fixed them. This game is shaping up to be amazing. Ignore the bad reviews, it's people that can't run the game. For me it runs fine.",5
Great,5
It's a solid OK. The raids are fun but the controls are not amazing and the AI design is just terrible. Also the gacha rates are the worst I've seen since Fate Grand Order,3
It looks simple buy it's a very technical beautiful game. And yes you go fully F2P because the Devs are so generous with their compensation for reporting issues since it's a new game.,5
ＡＤＤＩＣＴＩＶＥ,5
Amazing gacha game. Love the dragon transformation system. This game is a wet dream for Breath of Fire fans.,5
Super boring generic freemium phone game. Pretty disappointing that this is connected to Nintendo,2
I really enjoy this game. You can play for a whole day or just a few minutes. Good graphics and awesome music. Definitely a must play for Nintendo and gacha rpg fans.,5
Interface is sluggish even run as lowest settings. Touch driving the characters in battle is really difficult. You'll die a lot because the character won't get out of the way. Need a better system than this tap drag. How about tap only. It's still difficult to drive out of battle too.,4
"Best game in all of play store, very F2P friendly, the combat, music, graphics are all 10/10",5
Really fun,5
Love it,5
For people having issues with co-op freezing: Turn off your power saving on your phone and you can get through it.,4
"Controls recently fixed, now I can give a good review 😀",5
"Tons of fun to play! Easily by far and away the best mobile game I've ever played, it has actual controls and its not just about having the best unit but being able to control well, theres even mechanics like i-frames (invincibility frames) and animation canceling. If youre looking for a time sink thats actually FUN, youve found it right here!",5
The most beautiful and amazing game I'v ever played!,5
"Game hopped tons of mobile games, can confidently say that I will be staying on this one for years",5
"The gameplay is very fun, but I wish the was more stamina.",5
"The gameplay is more nuanced than it seems from the tutorial, with difficult quests requiring precise dodge rolls or good use of skills to survive each attack. What is more important, at least to me, is that the creators are incredibly quick to respond to feedback. While there were a few bugs and glitches close to release, gameplay is already a good deal smoother, and the creators have responded to player complaints about slow co-op stamina regen before the first event has even ended.",5
Very good distraction from FEH i dont feel like i have to pull for every character anymore so im saving a lot of $$,5
This game is great never had so much fun in a gatcha game,5
"Interesting storyline, good music and fun gameplay.",5
Fun new experience,5
Overly simple game with clunky controls and a exploitive gatcha based progression system. Dragon skinned casino.,1
Very fun and addictive,5
Cool game with excellent sountracks,5
Addicting,5
"I wanna start by saying the actual game is OUTSTANDING. While the controls are a little weird at times (needs a virtual joystick option) that is easily looked past. My issue with the game is the summon rates. Less than 1% chance for a 5* character or dragon, and you have to pull characters, dragons, AND wyrmprints from the same banner, effectively insuring you will almost NEVER pull that shiny 5* that you want. Seriously, the summon rates are ATROCIOUS. I've played door the past 4 days since the game came out. I've done about 10 multi summons. I've pulled A SINGLE 5* dragon. That's it. Everything I worked for feels wasted. I understand rng. But >1% rates are shameful. Maybe I'll try this game out again down the line if the rates are improved. Considerably. *Edit*: After playing longer, I've learned about the ""pity system"" which raises rates after 10 summons with no 5*. This helps, but rates are still too low, in my opinion.",4
Great,5
Great coop mobile game,5
Game is fun and you dont have to spend anything to enjoy it's full potential. Best gacha game I have played in a long time,5
A polished and content-rich gacha. CyGames really showing off their pedigree with this one.,5
"Great game, new addiction.",5
Love to play this with my friends. Thank god for no pvp.,5
Additional download the game,5
Fantastic game even though controls need improvement,5
"Very polished mobile game, CyGames and Nintendo lived up to their name! Soundtrack by Daoko",5
Why is that a week after playing it has taken 2.5 Gigabyte of space. There is no reason for there to be so many loading screens and additional downloads 5mb here 2mb it adds up by the time you get to the 6th chapter. And the controls suck having to try and open a chest and missing two time is a bit ridic.,1
Meh,1
Fun,5
Very fun lots to do and a pretty decent story. They are very generous with premium currency,5
"Good game, seems simple at first but end game is challenging. Gacha games arent for all but its pretty friendly to free to play if you stick to 4 star units",5
More predatory practices to cash in on whales and their isolation. Disgusting seeing Nintendo have their name on this.,1
Perfect,5
"Pleasantly surprised by how much I like the characters. Great music, entertaining gameplay. Gacha rates are low but you really don't need 5 star units for any maps, and devs are constantly giving out summoning currency anyway.",5
Only 2 critics: story cliffhangers and a little bug when multiplaying,5
Great way to kill time and the best part is that it's all free. Nintendo is on fire with their apps! =D,5
"Great game, devs actually care about their consumers.",5
"This game honestly deserves at least a 4 star average. The graphics are and gameplay are perfectly good and the story is excellent. Each character has their own personality, and the amount of content to explore is immense. The only part of the game that doesn't feel good is the gatcha 5 star rates are relatively low. However, 5 stars are not entirely required to make large progress in the game. The devs are also extremely responsive to feedback, which is a huge plus!",5
Good game,5
It gud,5
"beautiful graphics, great story and amazing characters, love your game and i cant wait to see what else you do with this game and future games <3",5
THE MUSIC IS HYPNOTIC AF,5
I have a good gameing phone ..game keeps crashing during co op tutorialstill not fixed!,1
Best game imho and it's only a couple weeks old. Some things to smooth out but I love it.,5
"Dragalia Lost is a game that is full of charm, from it's characters to the music. It always bring a smile to my face when the menu tune start up. Dragalia Lost always packed with gameplay for all. You can choose to play the game solo or join with random player for that one dungeon you can't beat. Hey you can always bring a freind or two. There is also raid where you need to team up to face a single raid boss. If you love rpg game and love their corny story give this game a try.",5
"Fantastic game, i really like the blend of old school Super Nintendo gameplay, is like a blend of secret of mana gameplay, and breath of fire concept, multiplayer mode is really smooth, keep it up!",5
"I really enjoy the music and artwork. I can tell the developers spent a lot of time polishing everything from the battle mechanics to the character stories. Personally this game isn't for me, I felt that it was a drag to farm so many gems to pull nothing, and having characters, cards and dragons all in one summoning pool is a huge turnoff. Strengthening characters with weapon upgrades, skills upgrades and leveling takes way too long. The reward for playing doesn't match with the time spent grinding away at the same few quests. Only recommend it if you're really bored.",3
"Extremely overhyped, the gameplay, story and graphics are as generic as it gets. I waited months for this games release and I'm sorely disappointed. The controls don't work, it's clunky and terribly implemented, how did it get past the alpha and beta phases? I've played a ton of gacha games and boy are the rates bad, not to mention it's split gachas where you're pulling for 3 separate focuses, Who thought that was a good idea? The music is the only redeeming point of the game, download sizes are stupidly big (having to download more with every chapter WHAT?) Overall a fail of a game, hopefully Nintendo's next release will do better then this letdown of a title",2
The game is great but I feel like the controls could be adjusted. I have it set to right and it feel really hard to control the character. Otherwise music and the actual game is great.,4
Terrible.,1
"As someone who doesn't think very highly of gacha games, I was pretty hesitant to give it a shot when I saw Cygames, a known gacha dev, was involved. But because Nintendo co-developed it and due to Fire Emblem Heroes generosity with currency, I decided to go for it. And I'm glad I did. The game is incredibly polished for a gacha game, with excellent graphics, gameplay better than many paid apps, and a solid story. Like FEH, it gives out quite a good bit of the summon currency, and while the summon rates for 5 star adventurers are low, 4, and even a few 3 star characters are currently very viable. I'm playing on a very old device so I have bad lag and I'm STILL loving the game.",4
"I dont normally play these type of ganes, but i saw it being played on the nayncave and caved in to start playing",4
This endearing and battle-filled adventure is an amazing mix of old and new as well as comedy and seriousness in terms of execution including storytelling and user interface!,5
"Production value is amazing, but it gets boring real quick and the gacha rates aren't great either.",2
"I really love the game but I have trouble tapping on objects such as the construction, or buildings in the castle because it wont let me level them up when i repeatedly tap them. The cursor/arrow in the quests are a bit wonky and I thought they could have been smoother",4
Very cute super fun,5
"Not wut I expected from Nintendo, especially bc there are only 6 apps on the entire playstore that are actually under their name. Love RPGs, but why couldn't they try this spin with one of their already mainstream and highly developed franchises? Are they ever going to give us an updated Mario RPG game?",4
Less battery killer,4
Really great game. You wont regret loading it.,5
"Trash, cash grab. Save yourself your sanity and money. Play something else",1
Just try it,5
Pretty fun,5
It's really not that good. Don't expect much from this game in the future,3
"Change the summon rates, wyrmprints shouldn't be double the rate of characters and dragons",4
Makes no sense that you have to download every new mission you go in to. Is super grindy compared to other gacha games and the horrible pull rates do nothing to make up for it. The story is boring and repetitive and quickly found myself not caring about it anymore. Trying to reroll and train up to get better characters so you can actually compete in the higher missions is slow and unrewarding.,1
Controls are terrible but it is a great game that has potential,2
"TL; DR Ignore the current score if the reason you're considering this game is because you are already familiar with the genre and want to try something new in the same field, Dragalia Lost is amazing.     Longer version: The current store rating (3.5 at the time of this review) is a seriously bad reflection of this game's quality.  Far lower than it should be compared to other similar games of the genre.  I think the Nintendo name has just attracted many players that may not be familiar with the dynamics of this variation of a free to play gaming model.  Other publishers likely also benefit from a more gradual ramp up in player base while they work out early bugs and balance issues.  It's probably true that the game is a bit demanding on your hardware, I don't think it's fair to blame the game for being more top tier than the average.",5
Still not playable here crashing out on loading,1
Good game with tons of potential definitely my favorite game,5
"I like the game controls are alright, could be better for people with smaller screens. Really don't like all the downloading. I've done multiple batch downloads and that doesn't seem to help at all.",4
Constant issues when trying to do any Co-op where the game will just freeze,2
"There's a glitch in the co-op I left it loading for over an hour and it didn't start the quest or even say someone joined my party, it just loaded...",5
This Game Should Be rated a 10 star,5
To many downloads,1
"Cygames, don't let Nintendo ruin your reputation.",1
Awesome,5
Good game can't wait for some more awesome updates to come out.,5
Got pretty boring. They tried to put a spin on the very generic and overdone gameplay by making the controls somewhat unique but it is not even close to enough to make it interesting enough for me to keep it. So I will be uninstalling this as it is also a rather large game and wasting space on my device in its current state.,2
"Extremely long loading times and occasional server failed to connect even while on wifi. Other than, it's a fantastic game",3
I love this game it's short simple and has a great story line plus it's made by Nintendo I recommend this game to all anime lovers,5
Coolcool,5
Art style is beautiful the draging of you finger to move is the 1 thing that will give you a hard time unless you use a controller for it.. and the summons..... ugh... great for the casual player. Imo. Download it and give it a try.,2
Good,5
"Looks pretty, sounds kind of cool and different. Fiddling with all the collectibles and team 'line ups' is satisfying but revolves around 'freemium' purchases. The meat of the game is several minute bursts of tap battles with some dodge swiping to add 'strategy.' Ultimately not enough to keep me going with the collecting side of things. Because it's pointless.",1
"The game would be great if I hadn't been stuck at the forced coop tutorial for the last week I have tried to play, if it were either fixed or skippable altogether that would be great",3
"Hello, I uninstalled the game for a night so I could focus on studying, and the next day i reinstalled it to play. I've lost all of my data summons and work. Could someone please get back to me? I had just cleared the light dragons chapter",3
"Overall, it's a really fun rpg. However, it seems to run really slow at times. Playing on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A.",4
"I loved this awesome game! The gameplay is nice, the characters are relatable, the dragons are majestic, the graphics are breathtaking, and the story actually feels like a fantasy. And the music is awesome too with Japanese vocal lyrics making me feel empowered. I prefer the game to be in sideways mode so the screen is not so cramped with my big fingers, making moving my characters harder than it needs to be. Overall, I prefer this game if you're into fun fantasy stories and dragons!",5
"The touch controls can be a little finicky, but it doesn't feel like a cash grab like other gacha games. I've gotten pretty deep into the story without the need to buy any bundles. The raid that just concluded was pretty interesting as well, and it looks like they plan on doing holiday themed events also. It's not perfect, but it's still pretty fun!",4
"The gacha rates are kind of meh, but the gameplay is incredibly fun. Developers have been very receptive to feedback so far.",5
Love it,5
We need ways to farm Mana BAD,5
Hello Nintendo I want to say keep up the good work but also I wish you add more games on mobile like splatoon 2 Mario kart or other thank hope you get this great work and I am a big fan.,5
"Great game with tons of content upon release. Cygames has been responsive to feedback and has provided compensation for even the most minor bugs. I see many one star reviews due to things like not having enough space on phone for the game or running out of battery from playing too much. Neither of which are valid reasons to leave a negative review. I have also seen reviews stating content is gated behind the gatcha system. I have completed all content including the first raid without spending a dollar on the game. You don't a full team of five star adventures to be successful, even three star adventures can be strong and useful. Overall I have enjoyed my time playing and this take on the gatcha genre. The graphics are nice for a mobile game. The story and characters are enjoyable. There are plenty of things to do gameplay wise not even counting the various events.",5
"Fun game, makes you feel like you're Euden",5
Nice game,5
Micro transactions are evil. This game has nothing interesting about it aside from voice acting. Other than it is very generic and seems like a money grab. And nothing more. Not sure how any developer would be proud of this...,1
"Yet another example of the sameness of major mobile games. Dragalia Lost is an action RPG filled with all the tried and terrible mobile game features we've dealt with for years. Also copies the most predatory of loot box schemes. But hey, it's pretty to look at.",1
"The game was pretty fun from the start, but unfortunately I cant progress any farther. The game wants me to create a room for the multiplayer but it freezes.",3
Its....okay? Really shocked such a mediocre game was from Nintendo. Nothing is really special about it. Doesnt stand out from the other thousands of similar hero tap/adventure games. Story is pretty boring and unoriginal. Would look elsewhere for a better time.,3
Amazing game,5
"I cant do the avanue to power, and the game is trying to get me to do it so I cant do anything else, but it wont load. I love the game but I cant continue because of this",3
"The game and story it self is fun, but once i enter chapter 2, i cant progress because it forces you to try co-op mode and i have try waiting 10 minutes to load but still stuck on the loading screen. I hope they fix this by not forcing the player to click co-op or add AI to fill the party.",3
Awesome Gacha game,5
Where do i start... First off this game to all who wish to download its huge. Like a grand total of 2 going for 3 gbs huge. How is this that huge? Its after i not only download all the extra data but the game itself. I say the main reason why its so huge its because the voice acging is not only in english but in japaness as well. Along with mutiple support of text language its huge . i like it,5
"Really cool ,fun and easy",5
I love this game I can't get enough of it,5
Nice,5
It has athication error and I cant fricking play the dang game,4
"Polished with solid gameplay, but with horrid gacha rates and exorbitant pricing for the premium currency. However, thus far they have been generous with handing it out for free, but there is no guarantee that it will continue past launch.",5
"I love this new ip nintendos created the soundtrack is amazing and the characters are cute I only have one problem the game frequently exits out of itself or maybe it's crashing idk but it's doing it way too much, I'd love if this was patched out or fixed so I can keep enjoying this great game",4
"I really like the game but can u guys fix this BUG? My Character,enimies and some things are black! Can u guys fix this?",3
Great game,5
So the game is fantastic everything about is awesome,5
"Terrible support, fun game but if you spend money and time, even if you link your account with Nintendo, if you loose your account , they wont help you .",1
An extra 1.3 GB are you people effn insane no where in your Google play description does it say that I need to download an additional 1.3gb of data false advertising. Delete,1
"It doesn't feel that much like a mobile game. Like, it'd even be good as a PC game.",5
Great game you can't go wrong with this game awesome music the raids are fun there's some glitches not going to lie but I'm sure in time they're going to fix it.,5
Coo l,5
"A cuck fest. Anything that is up to chance is rigged against you. Just one, of the many, bad Nintendo apps. To think I could've been playing Feh instead of putting a good 90 hours into this app.",3
It doesn't load when first doing the avenue to power event and can't progress forward,4
😁,5
Sadly it is hard to get five star character. But overall is a good decent Japanese mobile arpg.,4
"Really fun game, but could use improvements on the way it handles multiplayer. There needs to be a more streamlined way to play with friends than punching a 7 digit code every single mission. There is already a way to add friends, why can't we join a party where we can easily go from one quest to another and stay together without having to re-enter a new code. It's really taking away from the friendly grind experience. Fix this and you've got yourself a great game to play with friends.",5
Just. Wow,5
"Good game but every stage I have 2 download more data, please fix",3
DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT TAKES TO LONG TO LOAD THIS GAME IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME I WOULD RATE 5 IF THE LOADING WOULD BE FASTER DO NOT RECOMEND IT AND IF U SEE THIS GAME CREATOR PLS FIX THIS AND I WILL RATE 5,1
Stuck in tutorial when creating/opening a game room for co op. Cant proceed forward. Please fix this issue.,1
The overall game play is good design and characters are also great,5
Awesome,5
"Amazing game!! I love Dragalia Lost, it is very fun.",5
Cool,5
Great game. I like the mechanics. It handles well. Art is great and beautiful. One main complaint are the wyrmprints. They absolutely should not be in the general pull. They should have their own summons. The other one would be the 5 stars that you do get. I used the 5 star voucher that you buy and got a character I already had. So I basically paid 25$ for some leveling material. It didn't even give me a lot. That did leave a bad taste. I hope devs rethink the prints or maybe even special summon days where you can try and summon for dragons only or characters only.,3
Its basic. If it wasn't a nintendo it wouldn't be a problem but it is and if is bland and generic.,3
"Dislike how difficult it is... I play games for story, not to get a headache. Also the ai are useless... Bringing in an ai team to a fight gives a big disadvantage (online users have a separate dragon gauge and they activate skills frequently. Ai rarely use skills and dragon gauge is shared between ALL of your units). The controls also are a pain since it keeps redirecting where i swiped (causing my unit to run into a wall, miss abilities, or the unit doesnt redirect immediately after killing a unit... Which causes the last attack in the chain to completely miss). Summon rates are HORRIBLE. I didnt manage to get a single banner unit with all of my pulls so far which totals ~10 10+1 pulls. I did manage to get 2 dupe 5* banner wyrmprints... But who wants that?",1
Amazing game good controls only bad thing is all the loading it does,4
"I think that the gameplay itself is fine, but the controls and combo attacks are not very smooth. Also it takes a long time to load the game itself, and some people might not be as patient and just not play the game all together. All in all, I like the Storyline and the Characters, it is really interesting and fun to play.",4
"Great Gameplay, Great Music, Great Art, and overall just another solid game from nintendo.",5
would love to see a 3ds or switch release,5
Honestly..No complaints here I love it 💖,5
Graphics are okay ... Controls are glitchy and I wish there was a joystick but otherwise solid 7/10,3
"This game, despite what salty children will tell you. Is amazing. The story behind each character and the just the base story itself is just so amazing. The rates are truly bad compared to a majority of Gacha games, however this isn't too important. 5 star units are not necessary to complete any in game content. In fact the stat differences are minimal (+9 at the very max). On top of this, 5 star units take much more mana to upgrade than a 4 star unit. So don't be put off by the 'bad rates'. The content is refreshing and interesting with many different things to do each day.",5
Great game all around. It's free to play and still fun without indulging in the micro transactions.,5
A few things they can make better on the summons but good after that,5
Great JRPG for mobile. Nintendo knows what they're doing!,5
"This game so much better than the 3.5 rating.  Got off to a rocky release, but this game is very f2p friendly.  Great community, active discord and reddit.  Many players going around helping others clear special achievements in event raids.",5
"No idea why the game is so low rated. It's fun, a good story, leveling system, etc. Is there a game before this and the story isn't good enough for older fans?",5
"The problem isn't that it's a gacha game, the problem is that it does nothing to differentiate itself from all of the other gacha games available at the app buffet. The controls are bad, the choices for dialogue are a winceworthy English dub or no voices at all, and the visuals are cute but nothing special. It's mediocre at best. Middling. The fact that a powerhouse like Nintendo released this game knocks off an extra star because honestly I expect better out of a game with that kind of clout behind it.",2
Takes up 3.5 GB in storage hard to control movements but the games to easy,1
Fun game and excited to see more of what they do with it!,5
Love it,5
"It's too repetitive... Low gacha drops and the moving systems feels weird...you can play it and get hyped for few hours, after that you Will get bored cuz you will have to do the same thing once and once again...and it get worse when you look at those gacha drop rates plus you need more copies of the cards and dragon to max unbind them... But i can't complain about the history... It was good, sadly the game wasn't good itself...",2
Great game with wonderful controls and so far the devs are actually listwning to the community.,5
"This is a disappointing Nintendo game. The premium currency balance leans much more towards pay to play players. Gaining enough currency to do a 10-unit/dragon/card (yes, each summon will be 1 of 3 parts of a character build) takes a decent amount of time with pretty bad rates (I'm putting it around FGO rates). Controls are not very responsive and accurate which is necessary for an action RPG (especially for a mobile one). I always find myself attacking in the wrong direction. The story is okay but cutscene quality drops very soon after the beginning chapters/levels. I do find the soundtrack enjoyable and catchy. At its current state it's a cash grab. Nintendo needs to work on a lot of the summoningrates for all players and currency earning rates for free to play players as well as work on the controls.",3
I thinks it's a good game but my only problem is that the controls send my character all over the place. If their was a d-pad or a click and attack setting then I would give this game a 5 star rating.,4
"Great game, especially the multiplayer. The devs listen to feedback and ARE tweaking the game based on it, which is always really great to see. They give you tons of free units so if the gatcha system doesnt favor you, your not restricted in any way. The best part, TONS of story to enjoy. Best mobile game I've played in a long time, and I play a ton of them",5
Awosome,5
"I just play cause it has granblue fantasy characters. Controls are horrendous, you move with your finger and half the time it doesn't register correctly. Once in position you have to let go of the movement and start tapping to attack. Auto play... Is there, but don't expect much from it. CPU allies just like to stand there and look pretty in front of the enemies then attack 3 times and stop for 5 seconds. Gacha... It's a gacha game... What do you expect. I can't see myself playing it for long, but I need some sort of auto play game. It's an okay game.",3
"The game is good and hopefully Nintendo will build more on it with more ports, but speaking of this game will not work on the BlueStacks application. Hopefully things will change but for a game like this not being able to run on a gaming PC is a bit strange.",4
Fun game but takes a lot of memory space with updates.,5
"This game is beautiful, fun, and overall amazing. You'll never get board with all there is to do in the game. I wonder how long I'm going to play this for!",5
So addicting I love this anime RPG game nintendo I love this you and Dragalia lost,5
Its ok,5
This game is actually really good i tgought since its a new game their would be bugs and issues but there isn't the story is really captivating and thhe events help you get what you need this is a really good and fun game,5
The event tutorial is not working,1
Boring. Clunky. Story is unoriginal.,2
Allow landscape play for phones and possibly make the gotcha system more organized.,5
Great game everything is amazing but it doesn't let me passed the playing co-op tutorial. Please help! I really want to continue playing this game,5
If you want a game that completely takes over your phone...here it is. So i get past the initial download...guess what??? You guessed it another download. Ok ok...i let it go because i want to play the game. Played level 1ans guess what?...(u guessed it)Another download....level 3...same...horrible game.,3
It WONT EVEN LOAD SO IDK WHAT TO DO AND I CAN'T EVEN FINDS THE APPS I UNINSTALLED TO GET THIS GAME. Not cool developers... Not cool. 👎,2
Great game and amazing mechanics but the summoning (for me) was very bad at giving 5☆s.I have 4☆s monsters and heros but not a single 5☆(10 draws with a total of 15000).Might uninstall for that reason only.But everything else is a Amazing,3
"The game is great except one thing. The movement. It is so terrible and is not only an incredibly wonky mechanic, but it messes up combat. It is a continuously frustrating sytem that really messes up an otherwise good game.",3
"After playing through the first two chapters, the game starts getting more exciting to due to the upgrade & crafting system. The characters all have fun stories that you can collect about themselves to add another aspect to the game while waiting for your stamina to recover. Enjoy it thus far!",5
"Chapter 2, game forces co-op and im stuck on the loading screen... fix it.. its getting annoying",5
The graphics are simply magnificent and the gameplay feels very smooth. I enjoy the story very much and I look forward to more games like this,5
"Very good OST and VA, the story is pretty compelling. The gacha rate is trash, the most horrible rate in any gacha games i've played. The controls sucks, its not smooth and sometimes you get stuck. But the game is very f2p friendly, you only need to grind hard which everyone will do anyway, and even 3 or 4 stars can outdo 5 stars depend on your skills",3
There was a glitch with the loading screen when trying to do the event tutorial and I haven't been able to play since Every time I log on it just makes me do it and it will just do the same thing which is not load but besides that the game so far has been amazing and the music is my favorite part the gameplay mainly the movement controls,4
Like the game but am stuck in the loading screen for Avenue of power tutorial and cant go any further. Is there a solution for this?,2
Love the music!,5
Good game style but it needs better controls,4
Honestly i dont usually like anime type games but this one is a pretty good rpg. Plus nintendo isnt trying to suck your wallet dry,4
"I love it, became addicted and cant stop playing this game.",5
Great new type of ARPG,5
"It's a wonderful game at its core, I really like it The only problem is that the gacha summon rates are TERRIBLY low., with the  5 star rate for adventurers being ONLY .81 percent compared to most games 3 percent. The cost for paying to summon is very steep as well. Without wyrmite, a tenfold summon costs  1.5k Diamantium,  which is a Massive amount of 31 dollars. Every dollar is worth 48 wyrmite; an outrageously low rate.   They have some serious pricing and free to play wyrmite availability to address. The stamina is also terrible, sitting at around 30+ with missions taking 5-10.   It also has a castle building simulation that takes currency to speed up. They've done their best to jam tons of ways to encourage micro transactions into this game.",3
Always downloading...,2
"It's bland. It's another generic design, music, lazily made gacha summoning game. Enjoy gameplay far too actual attention demanding because auto AI is fine walking into all danger possible or not avoiding attacks it can. But manual controls are painfully wonky at best. The grind spam is real too and overall unrewarding. This game offers cute at best but you will tire of it in a few days really.",3
"Dragalia lost is a fun game but there are some definite flaws. The cutscenes lag (drop frames) like crazy, getting around an opponents guard isn't adequately explained but worst of all for people with not a lot of memory on their smartphone cards each new story, quest, or mechanic requires a download, sometimes small but sometimes huge. This can quickly fill up a smartphones memory if left unchecked. The controls are iffy too, i sometimes found myself attacking or running in the completely wrong direction and avoiding attacks isn't easy. The voice acting is fine, the storyline while cliche is fun and the ability to turn into a dragon and give it gifts is a unique mechanic but all the flaws left me going 'meh' overall. Some gameplay fixes and performance enhancements would definitely help (and less mandatory tutorials. Those can get annoying)",3
"The gameplay is really refined, and Cygames are constantly rolling out hotfixes. If they spot bugs that caused player inconvenience, they compensate with serious ingame currency! Not pay to win at all, power is really balanced and attainable if you exhaust your stamina multiple times a day.",5
Good,5
"UPDATE! If stuck at the Co Op room join, turn off power saving and retry! Worked for me!",5
"I love it, I just started as soon as it came out and I love the mechanics and storyline. The download times are long at the start but if you do a batch download you don't have to worry about it. Although, when you're selecting a helper I wish there was a way to sort by level or might and not just type. I'd also like more team slots and the ability to name your teams. I love everything else!",5
"A pretty entertaining gotcha with a fun dungeon crawling design. The story isn't the best, but the game play is really fun and the drop rates are fair.",5
"I am also having the coop issue. Attempting fixes other players have is not working for me. I cannot play the game at all, really, because upon opening it, I am forced into the never ending coop loading screen.",4
"It's a neat game. I've been enjoying it for the past few weeks. I just got to crafting 5* weapons. Don't bother trying to do high tier raid battles until your ready. The rewards you get at ""special"" the top heavily outweigh anything below. Focus your energy and gatherwings on growing your team. If there's ever a time where you think you don't have time to play, there's always time to earn more rupies.",5
"It's just flat out not good and not what I would expect from Nintendo of all companies. The controls are clunky, the draw rates are some of the worst I've ever seen (and I've played a LOT of gacha/collector games), and the heroes you are guaranteed to get are bland and boring. Nothing unique at all about them. If you want a good, fun hero collector, stick with King's Raid or Knights Chronicle.",1
"Amazing game. Great story, great art, a fun grind. This is one of the best games around on android. It's easy to understand and the music/audio is spot on. My favorite game on android so far. Good job!!",5
"I got stuck on the part where it asks you to do a coop game with bots, and then puts you on an extremely long loading screen which doesn't end to my knowledge. Just press skip if you want to avoid this. Otherwise great game. Edit: They emailed me back and told me it could be avoided by turning off power saving mode and they are currently fixing the problem.",5
"I love the game for both its chick art style, good writeing, and interesting gameplay. The only problems are the movement, due to the constant auto-adjustments, and the tutorial in chapter 2, I love the chapter so far, but the multi tutorial needs to be fixed. I've been waiting for 20-40 min and I have not found any matches. PLEASE fix this. NOBODY CAN FINISH THE GAME WITH THIS BUG!",4
It all good but the controls though...,5
"I would give this a five star rating but I am having so many issues. I can't make purchases without an error message popping up, and when I try to level up my mana circles it crashes every single time. I'll give it a 5 when this gets fixed.",3
At 1st I doubted this game will then I got curious and checked it out and I did not regret it The graphics are beautiful the characters all have good personalities and the game plays solid gold it's a beautiful game and I wish people would Chuck it out,5
Amazing game.,5
very n i c e,5
I love this game but... I can't get pass the co op tutorial it just keeps loading,5
This is a very interesting game with a very solid story that will keep you in. However the gameplay itself is very repetative and not very rewarding. I found myself losing interest while playing and being more invested during the actual story segments.,4
"Just opens to the main screen and song, then repeatedly announces that it can't reach the server. Same result on both WiFi and cellular data.",1
"I love this game. The character designs are charming, the world is intriguing and the gameplay has it's quirks but is fun. With some polish on the gameplay and gacha system, I'll be playing this game well into the future.",5
I would love this game if it actually worked.. Keeps stopping and going to my home screen with no warning. Then I have to start over.,2
"You guys doing a awesome job. You guys are actually very care about your players. I enjoys this game so far. But two things I want to point it out. One, why most class have the same skills? Secondly, please fix your control and full screen.",5
Better rates please,5
"Amazing game, best mobile game I've played to date. For those complaining about the downloads; you can download all needed data from the options menu.",5
It's a buttload of fun. The graphics are up to par with many jrpg games right now. The music is quirky and fun. The hero designs are colorful and fun. Gameplay is quick and easy for on the go fun. People need to chill as this is a hero collecting gatcha game. Yes it has pay elements but you get that monetary currency just by playing also. Litterally got some strong heros just by using the currency I get from finishing quest. Haven't spent a dime yet.,5
I like it,5
Coop is still broken. More usable than before but still barely works,4
Fun but grind heavy if thats not your thing you should pass,4
"This game is unique. The visuals are charming. The story has a familiar yet intriguing setting. The fact that the world is based on dragons and are viewed as somewhat like deity's, is actually my personal favorite. I hope to continue seeing more from this game.",5
"To play, read this text, then download 156mb data, then read this text, then download 214mb data, then repeat ad infinitum.",1
Its so danc and fun,5
I think it's awesome just kidding because I don't know if it actually is a good game. It won't work it doesn't load I keep on reinstalling the app but it won't work I was really looking forward to playing the game but it just doesn't seem to like me or something someone please help me 😢,2
Kk,5
"I think it's a fun game to kill time. Graphics are typical for Nintendo games, the controls are kinda sloppy, but overall gameplay and story is fun and Interesting.",4
"Best gacha mobile game Ive ever played and thats coming from a summoners war veteran. It plays like an ARPG, its action so you run around and fight things, swipe to dodge and all that. Except its awesome.",5
Best game ever Nintendo should make more games like this on any device,5
Uh not played yet,5
🐉-tastic,5
Just another abusive Gatcha game. Great production values. Randomly hung when trying to create room. Only real gameplay is endless menus and spending money on the Gatcha. Really disappointed.,1
It is very interesting and captivating I can't stop playing it uwu,5
"By gacha mobile game standards, this a good game. Pros: the gameplay, while simplified, is overall pretty fun. Even if you don't get your top tier 5* character, the 4*(and to some extent 3* characters) are just as usable. The Story: it's nothing that will blow your mind, but is solid and enjoyable. Cons: Some bosses can feel cheap(*cough* Zodiark). Base summon rate is rather low and is shared between Dragons, Wyrmprints(Cards that increase stats and give certain abilities) and the characters themselves. This can be frustrating at times but overall isn't too bad. Combat: There's really only one gripe I have with this. Some actions(such as force strikes and to some extent dodge rolling) need to be refined a little so that they're easier to perform. Areas: Any time you start a new level, you have to download it. It's short and barely takes any time, but it kinda interrupts story progress, albeit very minimally. TL;DR Dragalia Lost is a simple, yet enjoyable experience with a few forgivable shortcomings. Give it a shot.",4
"Great game! It's a bit slow in the beginning, but it gets a lot more fun when you start collecting more units and running Co-op dungeons with other people. It's almost like a diablo/monster hunter hybrid on the go! If you're into the grindy aspects of those games then this is for you. Controls are a teeny bit clunky and takes a while to get use to, but I'm having no issues other than that!",5
"I absolutely loved this game but it burned through my data in just a few hours. Great if you have wifi, which I don't since I live in the mountains.",5
Make an undead dragon,4
I think they should make it an anime,5
It's like those useless anime game but it's more better :-),5
Way to much to download. Could barely play it before it crashed. Had to keep retrying to download things,3
Great,5
"All it does is freeze, controls are weird, wish there was a lock button, very repetitive, easy to lose interest quickly",3
"This is an amazing game, I like the voice acting in this Gatcha Anime Style game the gameplay is amazing, the music is perfect and the story is well done, I can't wait for Chapter Seven 😀😁",5
"While it's not perfect, it's definitely a well-polished, charming, anime-style gacha game that is fun to play and worth my time.",4
"Installed the game and opened it, and got an error message saying that authentication failed! Im uninstalling and NOT reinstalling!!!!",1
I'm having trouble when it is making me go to the event screen and I have to create a room to play it. It Keeps loading and I left it on for an hour so I can't play the game not sure if others are having this problem hope to get it fixed so I can keep playing,5
"Ugly, boring runner type game that's been done a bazillion times. Cash grab.",1
I love the game but there are some things that can be improved. I found out that i can only play co-op if my phone is charging and i dont know how to fix that. But some improvements for co-op are as leader you can set a limit to how low of might the other people can have to join and vice versa you can find a party with a limit if you understand what im trying to say?,5
I enjoyed the game because it was like ffexvius but my god at least exvius didnt download for like 5 minutes every damn chapter,3
Overall really good but could use a bit of work. Very promising game that can be so much better if they listen to community feedback.,5
Need to fix glitch in coop tutorial wont load and cant back out,5
All of the 1☆ comments are trash. The game is fun.,5
"Good game, although I'm stuck in the tutorial of how to co-op event missions, it wants me to create a room and when I do it continues to load while never loading a room and I cant exit the tutorial, please fix this I really enjoy the game",4
"I think I like it.. Controls are.. in need of improvement. Doing a force strike is nearly impossible, sometimes, as is trying to turn while navigating.",4
"The game is really fun and addicting although my only problem with it is that it will the game will crash after a certain amount of quest you do or after a certain amount of time while it's running, other than that it perfectly fine and I recommend it for anyone who's bored and wants something fun to play.",4
言語設定を変えるとサーバエラーになります。,1
boring,1
Fun game!,5
"Always has to download to continue, game sucks...",2
Game freezes up when doing co op tutorial. Besides that there's nothing to review.,1
"When I first saw the direct for this game, I wasn't sure what to expect. After playing Fire Emblem Heroes since launch, I had never really played what others had considered a ""true gacha"" game. My first thought was to check it out before making a decision. From the first day, this game had me hooked! The story is great, the character stories help to flesh out the characters well, and the art is amazing from the 5* adventurers to even the 3* wyrmprints. I intend to play Dragalia Lost for the long haul, and I've enjoyed it every chance I've gotten to play it. This company has the quickest feedback response, I've ever seen! I'm in love.",5
"It's a good game with great music and story. Using thumbs to control the character was kinda hard to pick up for me. Then I got used to it in the first three hours of playing. The game requires a lot of time on farming experience for the characters. That's the part I feel tired and boring. I really enjoyed the raid event, until I realized I would never be able to complete all the rewards. I hope the official can further increase the dropping rate of gold badges, or add some daily drop rate boost hours.",4
I can't get through the loading for the 1st co-op mission i have to do in the game i've tried so many times but it just keeps on showing the shaded loading screen after i tap create a room. This is an auto part if the game and i can't do anything to get past it unlesd it actually works.,4
Love it and the music too,5
Hit that LIKE button to FLY instantly,4
No rooted device? Kiss it.,1
It wouldn't let me download it,1
"Beautiful and mostly fluid. I got hooked on start. Nice community and the developer team listens to feedback, and responds as soon as possible. As expected of Cygames I suppose. Give it a try! Don't like it? No harm done, right? I recommend at least an 30 minutes of gameplay.",5
My rating is due to a glitch that exists which makes it to where I can't get past Chapter 2-2-1 as a room can't be formed. It was awesome until that glitch showed up. I'll hope they can fix it to make it not need me sitting right on top of my WiFi.,3
Nintendo nailed the gacha.,5
It's an awesome game. I'm not sure why people are giving it less than 5 stars.,5
"Has potential to be good, but MAN is the Ally AI awful. Your units will literally just stand there while the enemy attacks them. As a result, you're forced to play online to clear some content, but the online function can be frustratingly inconsistent. I wish the auto-targeting for your attacks was more consistent as well.",3
Boi dis a pretty good game,4
it's nitindo game,5
Very awesome game love the graphics!!,5
"A really nice game, well made and a very nice storyline to go with it! The developers are very generous with free currency, so you won't be struggling to get your first good pulls. Multiplayer, Storylines, Events and Character/Dragon stories- what more could you ask for?",5
"It's fun at first, but content became stale after 10+ hours. Standard gacha phone game, grind for heros and materials and repetitive",3
"Pretty decent. Other than that, it could use some optimization.",4
"Amazing game. Kinda awful rates on characters, but you only need one. No copies or alternates or other BS. Developer listens to feedback and is extremely generous.",5
The game stays in an infinite loop trying to create a co-op room and can't play the game thanks to that. Becase it's part of the obligatory tutorial i can't do anything.,3
This game is really fun lots of free gems story is good graphics are good. I really enjoy it. Not sure why its not a 4.5 or higher i give it a 5.,5
"It is a very nice and enjoyable game! Lots of things to do. The only downside is there seems to be a bug in the game. I'm now stuck at ""avenue for power "" tutorial and can't get past the loading screen",3
"The game runs great on my Samsung galaxy S8+, the game is heavy on their menus, for daily limited purchases for mats I constantly have to keep buying one over and over. Can you do a scroll wheel for that please it's quite irksome. Story, game play, visuals, graphics, sound, voices, music, and drops are all really well done. They don't expect you to have the best of the best stuff in a month as well so it's a game to play for the long run.",5
Amazing game with an amazing company backing it up. Events are fun and rewarding and the f2p experience is pretty good if you don't have money for it. I wanted to be f2p but after a week I felt compelled to support this games development.,5
Pretty awesome game just wish the movement controls were better or able to be toggled. But other than that its a fun game definitely worth checking out,5
Very good job,5
"Great game to play overall, but controls are a bit strange but with a little practice it's nothing too much. The game needs a pvp or something competitive in nature.",5
Great game. Dont spend too much. Lol,5
"The games fine, controls are a lil off. My bigest issue is the file size 2.5+ G after its all installed. If you could find a way to shrink it or something it be nice. But given this reminds me of the breath of Fire series an its scope mixed with so many other apps of this archatype im not entierly suprised by the file size.",3
"Average at best. From gameplay to character models, the game just doesn't feel memorable",3
Great game. Made by my childhood company Nintendo!,5
"Can't even give the game a chance. Game play is bad, have to hold phone upright, music is annoying, downloads ever mission, and is a battery killer. Guessing it's just a money grab from Nintendo.",1
"Literally unplayable. I am on the co-op event tutorial where it makes you create a room and I have been stuck on it for 14-16 hours. However, other than that pretty good game",3
It is a great game but it is very buggy. I played for a week and got pretty far only to have the game glitch and lose it all. Kinda ruined it for me.,2
Awsome game,5
Fun.,5
"The graphic are good for mobile game standards however the eirly game hand holding, and need to constantly download each level got agrivating rather quickly unfortunatly.",1
Well designed,5
"Lots of review here are basically: ""My phone is a piece of junk : 1/5 star"" and ""I cannot play this online game offline: 1/5 star"". Do yourself a favor and look in the actual review instead of the current rating. Game has great music, great concept, and every character has their own story. Better yet, this is run by both Cygames and Nintendo, who listen to actual feedbacks unlike some cash grab games on the market. 5/5",5
"Can't even get past the load screen. Gives me an error saying ""Authentication failed"" every time and won't let me try anything else.",1
So I WAS loving this. And now it freezes when I try to enter coop or says it was unable to find a room. So now I can't complete the limited event.,3
"Honestly there are better mobile gatchas that one could play, this just is hard to control and doesnt look that good",2
"[[Edit after playing since day 1: This game has the best Dev support and most fair summoning, promoting, and earning sytem I have seen in a mobile]] This has to be the best music you could find on a mobile game. The main screen, boss battles, menu screens, all have damn good music. All of the characters have personality that shows through anywhere from the main screen to character select screen to the Fire Emblem-like conversations. The gameplay is simple with plenty of fun to have building your team or co-op'ing it up with other players on story missions and events. As for the gacha system, the drops feel well balanced and you can gain currency for it through quests, playing with people online, and going through the story. You'll get two full 10 set summons very quickly. You also gain the main characters through the story and (different from other games) you WILL NOT be throwing them to the sideline never to be used. They are very useful.",5
Great gane,5
This game has amazing graphics for a phone game,5
"Great gacha game, happy that the devs listen to the community as well. Looking forward to the future of it.",5
"Summon rates are terrible and controls are pretty bad. Love the music and artwork but other than that, this not my thing.",2
It's pretty bad. Definitely a money grab game.,1
It fun to play with my family,5
Beautiful game with great co-op,5
Extremely bland..,1
A fantastic game with an amazing soundtrack and real time ARPG controls to take you away from the boredom of turn based or card based combat.,5
"Very grind intensive so take your time with this one. Summon rates are trash and it takes a ton of material to fully level a character. With this being said every character has the potential to be really good. There are literally so many things to do in this game all ready! Its hard to put down. Very free to play friendly, not so much for casual spenders that like to summon, you will find yourself in a deep hole with not a lot to show for it, and not nearly enough material to power yourself up. I have a note 8 soooo controls are fine once you get the hang. Pros -Super fun -Very polished, graphics music and dialog. -Developers have been very generous with in game currency. You have to earn it though. Cons -Multiplayer has stamina, and it very costly -Missions stamina is high Tips -Build your castle -Level your units evenly -4 star units are really good and will be the base of your team. -have fun",5
"really fun game with friends. give it a shot, you'll probably enjoy it",5
Game randomly closes after playing it for a bit...,2
"This game is wonderfully made, the graphics, character design, and music is great! A little grindy for my taste but nevertheless I've had a lot of fun.",5
"I've made it a rule not to play games with Stamina. But I'm still trucking. If you hate the stamina system it won't hurt really effect you for many hours, and even by then it has already a good source of entertainment.",5
Horrible game!!! Controls are the worst and coop connection is not great at all. At the you can't even get into coop. Don't waste your time. Also gacha rates are beyond horrible!,1
Awesome game,5
"The game is very well made and fun. The characters have some funny quotes. Dif from most mobile games of this genre where they play themselves, the controls get some getting used to but I still have a blast.",5
"Like most gacha game, stingy with rates, but that aside the gameplay design is the most fun i have had out of all the gacha game i have played.",5
"The characters seemed hardly different, the combat was borring, and the story was clitche as hell",2
Addictive And Nintendo Did Well,5
Yaw yeet,5
👌,5
"Good, but could be great! Controls are wonky...Just give us a control stick already! Co-op network disconnections are a huge headache. Gatcha system is very apparent in this game. I've done around 15 10+summons and still no 5* hero. Hero and dragon back stories are fun. Ranking up heroes and weapons is crazy expensive and/or a huge grind.",3
Really fun and polished ARPG. None of the other popular games of the genre have hooked me like this one. Generous currency and polish you'd expect from a game with Nintendo involved. Glad I got started at the beginning to see how it's going to grow and evolve.,5
"Cute game that rears its ugly grind a few hours in. Controls seem like a step backwards for mobile games (trying to turn while moving gets really wonky, why not just use a virtual pad?). Every section of the main menu needs to load in-between every action, making navigation a PITA. I'm going to play a little bit longer to see if anything improves or I get used to the clunkiness, but the weapon grind is horrifying",2
"-Graphics are super cute -Controls are pretty ok -Pull rates are ok by gacha current standards -f2p friendly -might overwhelm the individuals with a lot of features at first. -co-op is very enjoyable (especially raids) Overall, the game is pretty great in my opinion.",5
Lots of bugs.... Large amount of storage needed to play all the campaigns. Freezes when looking for co-op rooms and won't let you back out. Menus need to load faster and simplified. AI is really dumb if you auto you'll most likely die. Wish there was a landscape option. Despite these issues the game is pretty fun otherwise.,3
Game froze up the first day I played it and now its locked on loading something every time I open it never even made it past lvl 3,1
"Looks gorgeous (for mobile) and can't help but love the character designs - especially the dragons. Takes up a massive amount of space to download, though, and once you start playing the game, you have to download each level individually. What on earth was downloaded in that first 1.3G if not the game?? Cute game, but between constantly interrupting gameplay for mini updates and the huge drain on battery, not something I find sort sticking with.",2
Really fun. Nice looking. Great music. Warrior style gameplay. Fe heroes type summoning. Really fun,5
"I really enjoy this game. The music, the graphics, the flashiness of the gameplay...my only issue with this game is the controls. Targeting enemies is hit and miss, and movement is bad. The slightest adjustment of your finger can cause your character/team to do a complete 180 and change directions (usually at the worst times too).",4
"It's an ok app but there are some stuff a dislike and wish for the creates to add. I don't like how you can't pick a gender, I know the story is revolving around a prince but it be nice to pick your gender, I don't think it really change the story. Another thing I dislike are the controles. I think they are a bit too sensitive and I'm use to a joystick so maybe add more options for controles. Also the music, it's cool and nice to listen too for a while but it starts to get annoying. Maybe the songs can change throughout the day or you can change it manually? Other than that I really like the art, story, and voice acting, I find it hard for me to stop playing and when I'm not I'm thinking about it.",3
Looks great! Controls are a little iffy but the game is awesome...,5
It's good. 👍,4
I think the game is amazing but the game play when actually fighting is kindof slippery and really hard to control,5
"Great game, hoping it wont fall short",5
I feel great for Nintendo going for an original mobile game. The soundtrack is good and I love the chibi. I think this even has potential for content in Smash!,4
Solid gacha,5
"It's a beautiful game so far. I particularly like how the English voice lines don't sound forced or read from a script. It sounds like the characters are having an ACTUAL conversation. The graphics, for the Android side, are amazing. The story is entertaining. The only problem I have with this game right now is how the movement/controls work during a quest. If there was an option for an on-screen analog stick, whether we can put it where we want or if it was locked in the bottom left or right, it would make navigating way easier. Right now, sometimes the cursor resets and clips my character facing another direction. Which, in turn, makes angling attacks extremely difficult. No need for an on-screen button to attack; just an analog that controls the movement. That would make my gaming experience a lot more smooth. Update: I've supported Nintendo already by purchasing a few of the packages, but looking at the Diamantium prices, even with the weekly reset, I can't justify spending $4 for 2 summons (if I'm just using it for that), which breaks down to $2 a summon. That's ridiculous to me. You have so many people already playing this game already; you're going to make bank from player purchases. I don't know if it's greed or what, but that's just my opinion.",5
"Overall, way too much to install, requires it's own SD card, would have been better as a more fleshed out switch game.",2
This game is enjoyable and easy to play.,5
bad game no idea why so many people play,1
"For a recently released game, the amount of content and the gameplay are fantastic. You dont really have to necessarily pull for a five-star unit because each unit is really good in there own ways no matter the rating. I will admit that the amount of wyrmite you can obtain currently is rather low, especially when you have cleared basically everything you can and there isnt much left to do. I know that my statement of the amount of content being great followed by a minor complaint about said amount may seem like I am contradicting myself, but its as I said: for a game that has more recently released, it has a fair amount of content. Gameplay is pretty solid and easy to understand, and the difference in gameplay styles between the weapons is nice because each weapon is unique. Is the game great? Yes. Can I understand some of the lower ratings? Somewhat. I understand that this game isnt for everyone and isnt the style gameplay they may like (or hate how it drains your battery faster than your wallet if you really actually pay for things cause apparently 5 stars are a must have) but honestly if ya gave it a bit of a chance it may grow on you. Hope this review helps :)",5
"I don't usually like games like these, but this one is so different. Great character designs, weapons, and catchy music for everything. I cant explain why I love it so much",5
"BUG occured! When i am going through the create a room training session, the game stopped after i pressed *create a room* i tried to change the game lanuage, cant help. Then i uninstall the game, once uninstall, my original acc is not there anymore. So i play the game from the very beginning again. But this issue occured again when i reached to the training of create a room I cant skip this training. It force me to do so everytime. And so i cannot continue the game. I am sad about this.",1
Graphics great gacha great transforms skills OK but here's were it starts to hit the fan Controls are horrible storyline game play is just that so get ready for story time and the switch off characters could be manipulated better but the control system really lost me but just opinion,3
"A gacha mobile game from Nintendo. The 5* chances are extremely low, pulling one actually makes your day. The game is at an early state so we should expect improvements later. Controls are a bit eh, couldn't use a charge attack because it registered as a Dodge or Basic Attack. Stamina and wings needs a little more work. Co-Op is full of 5*, even when their element is weaker. I play this game daily.",4
Won't load past Avenue to Power! Please fix!,1
Gooooooood,5
Awesome,5
"Cool gacha game with disappointing gameplay. Great graphics, music, voice acting, story, art. It has everything except gameplay that makes you want to keep playing. Would be one of the best games out there if it had better gameplay. The Wyrmprint system in the game is also probably the most boring thing I've ever seen in one of these games and the fact that it's tied to normal summons makes it even worse. Sink your time and money into another game. I'd recommend Dx2 or Onmyoji",2
Great game but it cost $32 for 10 summons lol. Dont spend a dime on this game. Just use the summons you get with normal play.,5
Good but the controls could use work and the text dialouge is very slow,4
"Looks pretty but the tap the screen fighting mechanic is repetitive and makes trying to use ""force"" attacks a pain After the removal of wyrmite for playing co-op there isn't really a reason to bother with co-op. Surprisingly the microtransactions are reasonably priced comparative to most other mobile games. Unfortunately the game put you in a situation that almost requires you buy special items with the microtransactions. Character development in the game doesn't seem to make any real difference and neither does character rank between four star or five star. The story however is quite entertaining and worthy of standard release not just a mobile game. If this game came out on the switch as a proper game without all the mobile shenanigans it would be an easy recommendation but as a mobile game 3 1/2 out of 5 it's an okay game not great but not awful.",3
"Pretty fun, like the characters and the total vibe",5
i really love the graphics and the characters but gOD over 1gb of space just for a game??? and every quest it tells me it needs to download more uGh its annoying why is the game so large,3
"The art, music and gameplay are amazing, and the controls take some getting used to. In all the game is top notch.",5
"Not sure why so many negative reviews, the game is a quality experience for free and so far reasonably generous with the premium currency and pull rates for units etc. Similar to Fire emblem heroes in that regard. There's some grind like any rpg and f2p but you can just play and not worry about it for a good amount of time before needing to farm and such.. but even then it's not painfully slow. They're not pushy trying to get your money like many other games and there's actually quality and content here in the story telling and gameplay. I like it and will keep playing as long as these things start true.",5
It is a great game but there is alot of lag.,3
"Prepare to get (dragalia) lost in the beautiful animation, in depth crafting systems, interesting and engaging characters as well as the fantastic gameplay! Been playing since day 1 and I remain eager to load it up everyday and complete my objectives and set new goals. I highly recommend this game, its quite choice!",5
Wonderful all around,5
Don't work on Lenovo tab a7-20f please fix stuck on the downloading screen,1
"This game could have been something. I mean ""COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING!"" What are my problems with this game? Well let me tell you. The constant downloading of a stage. I mean come on... Who said, ""Hey guys lets REALLY annoy people by making them download every stage"". See this wouldnt been a problem, if... I didnt need to redownload the SAME STAGE! So when you get done downloading and log off for the day and come back... Yes you got to redownload the same thing. That is the most stupidest thing ever... Overall the controls are decent enough to play. Sometimes I hate it and other times I dont mind it. Other people only have the problem of downloading stages. This might be a download issue or not I have no idea. Would I play this game again? Yes and no. Yes, maybe in the future when a lot starts to change and No, not anytime soon because now I have other games now that took its place.",2
What I think is a awesome game,5
"Very fun game with a good story, likable characters, and a good gacha system. Also, Karl is my favorite character in the game and I am so happy I was able to promote him to 5 stars. Thus, I will give this game 5 stars as well, besides the fact that it is a ton of fun.",5
"I like it, but I'm at a part for multiplayer I need to make a lobby, but it never stops loading no matter how good the reception is where I'm at so I'm stuck",4
"It is a quality game with good graphics and somewhat interesting story. However, In my opinion, the controls are horrible and the summon rates are the worse I have ever seen. I played the game for a while and did several rerolls and summons, all of which amounted to nothing. It has some of the worse rates, if not the worst, I have ever seen. If you want to play another money hungry gatcha game, this is it. Aside from the rates I find the game play itself boring.",2
Game sucks got 5 star jeanne arc and then game crashes. Reload game and she's no longer there. At least summoners war didn't do this. Please fix,2
"Literally every brown character is an Archer. At first I was so excited to see Hawk he had a taper fade and a bird and a bow and it was cool. But then I look into maybe putting together a team of all darker toned characters - but they're all archers, save one mage who appears latinx. It's weird af. More diversity amongst the classes please. Give a brown guy a sword. Representation matters a lot. I was genuinely more excited and interested in collecting more characters when I came across hawk. And shortly disappointed in the fact that he is one of many poc coded Archer type characters.",1
It's amazing!!!!!!!!!,5
"It's an MMORPG on a mobile device, what's more to ask? Gameplay is extremely fun, you can sink hours upon hours playing this game.",5
Good game. Easy to just pick up and play either a few mins or a few hours,5
"Waaay to many downloads in between missions taking up so much space not even funny, other than that the controls could use some work. Also not a gacha fan at all I'd rather pay 1 price for the full game than unlock extras, too bad this game could have been great",2
"Great game but I've never seen worse bots in my life. Can almost never do any mission even when I'm 2k might over bc my bots will just stand in front of enemies and take damage, stand in traps, and my healer never heals us ever.",1
I'm stuck when it's teaching you about the events and it makes you create a room i can't do anything it just loads forever,3
All this downloading for a little as game so it drain my battery not worthy,3
I'm enjoying the online multi player a lot.,5
Good enough,5
"Guys, you need to turn down your graphics x10. I've got games with more complex visuals that don't routinely crash. Echoing my previous review and saying your QA sucks.",1
Game was at a white screen for 20+ seconds and then once something happened it just got to a menu that said it couldn't connect to a server and never went anywhere else.,1
"i see gacha, i rate 1*. i am a simple man",1
"Best gacha game on the market, and it has that Nintendo polish and charm!",5
Really awful draw rates and horrible AI. The end of events are locked behind the highest tier of raid battles. This is a poor effort from the team that made Granblue Fantasy.,2
Fun game,4
The game is great and the support staff are just as good! 10 outa 10!,5
Gacha rates is trash and game is way too grindy. Art is fine I guess.,2
I honestly love the design and what they went for but the gameplay is boring and you have too download every piece of story and gameplay part so it's kinda a downer,3
It's an okay game. Though it gets pretty boring after a couple chapters.,3
"The inputs give a little trouble sometimes but overall a solid, fun game.",5
I like the game it's visually appealing and when running smoothly it's fun to play but it has bad lag on my device anyway.I also don't know why every map needs to be downloaded that feels like the game is poorly optimized.,3
"I was not to sure about this game but after playing it for a couple hours and doing my first raid I was sold the raid system reminds me of Final Fantasy XIV mechanic system, I'm hooked!",5
It wouldn't even let me in the game to even,1
It's is really good,5
Gameplay is great. The stamina and wing system needs some rebalancing but the combat is fun and exciting,5
I like this game,5
Surprisingly fun action rpg.,5
Great game so far.,4
"This is a really fun game with a surprising amount of skill, depth, and challenge. There's a lot of fun characters to use and the combat in the game makes it feel almost like a mini mobile monster hunter. The only issue I have with the game is that the content is being time and resource gated as I'm sure the developers don't want any one rushing through the main content too fast but the future looks very bright :)",5
"Great game! VERY ADDICTIVE, we haven't stopped playing since we installed it! The music is great and so are ALL of the visuals! Thanks for Dragalia Lost!",5
Absolutely love the combat system though some might have problems with swipe/hold touch controls. Great music for me personally(daoko) and adorable chibi characters.,5
There was a big where I couldn't go past on creating a room. Okay for context I was doing a story and it had me create a room but I had closed it at around the same time it opened the room for online. After I login again I could no longer make a room it would just keep on loading,3
Another Crapcan from Nintendo,1
"It's honestly very fun, game has a very lovely sound track and the combat is fun when I'm not messing up my focus strike. At some point i hope they add something like pvp down the road",5
It's pretty fun,5
"It's very pretty, and the music is wonderful. The story send like it may be interesting too, but I uninstalled. Unfortunately, the gameplay is overly simplistic. Despite the obvious with they put into this game, I found myself very bored after about 30 minutes. This is a good game if you really just want to watch an interactive movie. If you want to be challenged at all, hard pass.",2
"Really good game. The lottery pulls aren't dreadful which is a definite plus. Joined during this raid event so I was able to power up fast as well The controls are a bit meh. Don't particularly like moving, dashing, attacking, and charge attacking all being on a single touch. Music is catchy as well. Designs for characters are nice and not excessive with fan service, which is a plus. Definitely a good 8.5/10.0 mobile game, though if they could just add an option separate movement from attack touches, that'd be great",4
Decent game but I feel like the reviews would be a lot better if they made it all one somewhat large download instead of several downloads,4
i can do anything on this game downloaded and gave me a authentication error to play so i delted n downloaded again n same thing,1
Unabashed gacha skinner box. It's dark design to prey on the easily addicted.,1
"The main flaws I've encountered is the Ally AI is some of the worst out there, the summoning rate is pure gambling, and that the stamina/getherwings(coop currency) are overpriced and annoying to acquire naturally (particularly the getherwings). Outside of that, the game is great.",4
Uuum.... Well I played this for a few minutes and let me tell you.......the controls.........kinda really suck......it doesn't feel smooth enough it feels stiff and slippery. The graphics are nice for a mobile game. I just couldn't stand the controls to play more.,3
"This is an amazing game other than the fact that you can't progess any further than the touch screen will allow. Wanna upgrade your castle? TOO BAD! THE GAME WONT ALLOW YOU TO TAP ON YOUR MINES, UPGRADE CRYSTALS, OR DRAGON FRUIT RESOURCES!",1
It's fun and I love the 3D,5
Good game but it lag's alot,3
"A very cracked shiny jewel. This game sports some amazing presentation, story and characters. Every pulled unit has a full side story. Gameplay is average ARPG, but the controls are very poorly implemented. Inaccurate movement, poor tap reading when other actions are happening. Gacha is very rigged, with three different things in a single pull, units, dragons and wyrmprints. Low rates and wyrmprints having highly boosted rates means pulls feel like a slap in the face. Multiplayer is broken by design. Hosts use stamina which refills fast. People who join use wings which refill at 1 an hour. 6 max. Raids use up to 3 sometimes. Co-op lobbies take more then 10 minutes sometimes to fill as all players have no wings to join.",3
Awesome game,5
"I love this game! The controls can get a bit annoying at times but that's probably because i suck at using it. Graphics are really good, the characters are adorable!",5
The best game I have ever had on this phone. Nintendo just needs to fix it up and make it more smooth. The fighting system is a bit icky though,5
Good graphics. Everything else about it sucks. The controls are so bad = uninstall.,1
Men should just stop.,1
"I am really enjoying this game. There have been very few mobile games that's held my attention for more than 30 minutes. My only issue is for some reason I can't get past the co-op hosting tutorial. I have tried to do it on wifi and cellular data, but it hasn't changed. I don't want to uninstall the game because I don't want to lose progress or any of the items if gotten through summons.",4
"Gameplay is ok despite horrible movement controls, but gets really repetitive. Basically the game boils down to running through samey levels while hack and slashing through enemies and sometimes having to dodge attacks. There are charge attacks if you long press on the screen, but half the time these don't work. Gacha rates are typically bad. No surprise there. The game does the typical mobile game thing where it throws tons of in game currency at you in the beginning, but eventually scales it back to get you to pay in order to progress. Pretty shady practice but it's par for the course so not surprising. Story is ok. Not super engaging. It's spaced out between limited time events that you need to focus on and grinding so of course the story isn't going to suck you in and make you want to know what happens next. 2d art is pretty good. Standard anime waifu/husbando bs. 3d art is kind of meh but it's a mobile game so it gets the job done. Music is catchy. Biggest problem I have with the game is that it's too much of a time sink and ultimately doesn't feel very rewarding. There are other games I'd much rather be playing and/or spending money on. If Nintendo didn't have their logo on the game I'd say skip it. If you like Nintendo it's worth checking out for a few days until you get bored with it. The dragons are pretty cool though.",3
"this game has great picture and story. control is very easy. and voice so cute. i very like it, but  i give this one star, why?  this game can not play on New York subway. as we know. signal can not cover the NY subway . i download this game because i think this game is good game can kill time. when you on subway in traffic. no signal on subway. it show could not connect the sever. all kind of game can not play on offline is one star.  i suggest this game can be buildup offline story mode.",1
Really fun when you get into it.,5
"This game is rather addicting for people like me. Easy to get into and though some parts can get ""complicated"" the game will show you how to do them (mana circles, castle features, unbinding, etc.) wonderful gacha game",5
"Its engaging, especially silly for a phone game. The stories are entertaining and the characters have a lot of personality even the side charecters. The graphics aren't over the top but they are very polished and have alot of color and the music really is addictive and catchy. It's very hard because I don't like sharing my phone battery with games. Also the controls are ok. However I think they need more control options, personally I hope they release a switch version. But this is ok. I'm still playing. It's a shame that there's so much... moneyish stuff. Especially since I'd rather just pay 20$ or 40$ for the whole game and alot of the pay stuff if way to much money for what they give you.",4
"Good, but massively p2w in my opinion, and 5 star character rates are terrible.",3
Overrated,1
"Game was fine, today though I've been receiving a suooort 400 error code so now I cant play, is there a fix for this?",3
"The controls aren't great, it's expensive and the drop rates are pretty bad. The story is not well written and very cliche. Just a whole lot of disappointment honestly.",2
I love the characters and the story! Also DAOKO's music is FIRE!!,5
跳坑吧 朋友，混池必死，混池必坑,2
Best new mobile game since Fire Emblem: Heroes!,5
Really hard to maneuver the character but dodging and attacking are smooth if they just fixed the movement game would be great. Graphics are really good. Gacha is terrible really low chance of getting 5 star,3
Don't trust the low score guys It's a good game,5
There is nothing that sets this game apart from the tons of other summoner based games out there. Sure you can control the character in battle but its kinda sloppy,2
Too much gatcha B.S.,1
I cannot finish the tutorial 2-2 to do multiplayer the game itself is fun and fine. I've already googled the issues my phone isnt on VPN or using power save I have no fix for this. Please patch this soon.... I am also using an S8 active,1
"Is one of this game you just get addicted to. There are a few things that can be done better, but it has a lot of potential to become something even greater in the near future.",5
"Takes about an hour to get into, but very fun. Negative reviews likely due to gacha system but premium rewards are very generous. Raid bosses worth they hype!",5
"I love this game OST but the gacha part just ruined all the good things. The rate is terrible, only 2 four stars out of 50. I'm out. (._.)",1
The ultimate gacha formula. All your waifus can turn into dragons/dragons are your waifus.,5
"Such a bummer. This game is beautiful with amazing art direction. Colors pop, characters are interesting, the story is well told, the sound is crisp. So what went wrong? Well, the controls. The controls are terrible. How Nintendo could put this out in 2018 is baffling.",2
Rate up is a lie.,1
I got stuck on events,5
This Is Anime made by Nintendo. nough said.,5
"It's like Clash of Clans in anime style, gacha game format. It didn't really do anything to reinvent the wheel. I'd avoid it.",3
"Aggressively average. Nothing new or innovative. Drop rates are awful, one of the worst I've seen so far, have yet to get a 5 star hero and I've been playing every day since I started (a few days after launch). The controls are finicky, one tiny adjustment to your direction will have your character careening through both time and space, and holding down your finger to do a charged attack 80% of the time just doesn't work. The NPCs are useless, they won't get out of the way of enemies attacks and will never actually attack anything themselves. The story has been done before, the basic ""hero must gain strength through a conveniently newfound power to save the world/girl"". Honesty I think it's the same story out for most other mobile rpgs out there as I was always 3 steps ahead of the story. It's a good time killer, just stop or slow down after you get all the easy to acquire summon tokens (can't be bothered to remembered what they are called) because when you can't spin to get new shinies the fun of this game takes a nosedive off a steep cliff.",3
Can you at least get rid of the parts where you have to download it,3
"Great game but I dislike the fact that it doesn't download the entire game and after beat a episode (?) It downloads the next, which is very irritating",3
Nice,5
"It's honestly an amazing game, and wow, imo the best Gacha/Mobile game yet! The characters feel all so real, and the fact that they all interact with eachother, either in the Quest themselves, the story, or the side stories we read on in the Castle afterwords! The style is so lovely and the colors just pop, if anything the entire Story, Music and Dragon Mechanic is so so SO SWEET/FUN. Then the Castle building and all the other features that brings is just, such a smart addition! Why didn't any other Gacha games think of that!? Also, the whole skill learning system is really fun, very similar to a skill tree attribute of regular RPGs but with the option of you just picking which ability/stat you want first. The only slight thing, is that in the Gacha pull, you're gonna be pulling more than just Characters, but also Dragons and Cards! So it's a tiny bit harder to pull a character, BUT, so far, what I've seen, THERE IS NO DOUBLES OF CHARACTERS. There is doubles of Cards and Dragons tho! If that's a slight worrying, dont worry The characters all strong in their own ways, especially when combo with good set of Card, Dragon and Weapons! You can make it through the stages with a good group of 4 Stars, heck, I'm using the characters we got through the main story perfectly fine! If anything, they're even stronger than most of the ones I've gotten in the Gacha so far. Btw, the new event, is super sweet, and love it that you just need to grind for that character by doing quest with her, basically a free powerful character, that is awesome!",5
It's great! This would be fantastic if you let us pet the dragons though,4
Please let us pet the dragons,4
"This game has a lot going against it, but the core gameplay eventually gets fun and challenging at the later levels. For most of the early part of the game it's just a repetitive grind to get through the story. The first and biggest problem is it has extremely low rates for an above average pull (average being 4 stars, low being 3 stars and high being 5 stars). There's literally only a 1% chance of getting adventurers that are significantly better than story characters you get by default. Next the match making system needs work since it only works with a massive pool of players. It doesn't allow anyone to control who's in the room so low levels wanting a leech can just waste everyone's time by refusing to leave. But once you get past all the ugliness, there's pretty fun and fluid gameplay in much of the more challenging parts of the game, like the max level assaults, dragon trials, and extra raids. A group that's 34k in a 28k might fight can easily lose if people suck at dodging, or a 32k group can easily win with good dodging, coordination and timing. Sadly though finding these groups is all up to luck with no way to control who goes in a group short of making a private group. 3.5 stars might be generous for how much work it takes to be fun. Without the featureless matching system and poorly balanced p2w system, this could be a pretty good game.",3
"Game play is one dimensional, repetitive, not difficult at all. 3 star heroes are just as strong as 5 star heroes, no real sense of progression. Chibi art style is meh and combos arent satisfying at all. Worst of all are the movement controls, whoever thought of them should be fired, a simple joystick would have sufficed. 2D art is okay. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",2
完全に白猫の下位互換。3Dキャラも作りが粗い。その上ガチャもクソ仕様。いくら任天堂とはいえソシャゲなめすぎでは…,1
"Best mobile game I've ever played. Amazing storyline, amazing characters, amazing art, best music I've ever heard on a mobile game. A must play!",5
when can you solve the bug of shop.,3
Controls are simple yet crappy. Since you can touch anywhere to move you have to reposition your thumb often and if you don't it makes it hard to change direction. Combat gets boring fast.,2
10/10,5
I like the game alot but the diamonds you need to summon is ridiculously high,4
Love it,5
"Okay visuals and has nice music, but everything else is terrible.",2
Its a good game but its uncomplicated. Keep needing to download to play,3
5/5 grate game I love the animations for the characters I love the character art as well. If you are looking for something new or even something to play with your brother or friends its a good co op game. I don't have a single complaint about it. I'm still enjoying it,5
"10/10 gatcha gameplay, would reroll again.",5
"I think that it has way to many downloads cause you have to download everytime you go to a new mission, the story should be told cause that'll give the characters more background and draw people in to play longer,then last but not least the combat system is weird because when your running and you turn the arrow it spazes out to make your hero do a slide towards a point your not even pointing but over all the plots great",3
"Was liking the game even spent money on it and now I'm stuck in a never loading tutorial for co-OP I can't doing but sit and watch it load to create a room and it never loads I left it fir over a half hour and nothing happened this is bs I can't back out of it if I exit the game it loads back into the tutorial it's a vicious cycle, please fix this or give my money back",3
"IT'S GREAT, I don't know why people don't like it's pretty good but I'm only at half they way there.",5
I dont think the game is bad but it gets really repetitive after a while and it does take up a fair amount of space.,3
Fun,5
"This game is amazing! It has a very surprising and we'll done sound track. Alongside a very simple, easy and fun controls. There's so much more I could go over but I think it would be best if you just experience it rather than hear me praise it.",5
Ok,5
This would be a good game if the controls weren't so bad,3
Honestly it's your typical Japanese gacha game. Combat controls are kinda annoying so there's that.,2
When I try to install the downloadable Content it frezzes plz fix Nintendo,3
Great game so far. Really like the feeling and the story. Can't wait for future updates,5
"As awesome as the game is, the amount of memory it takes is astounding which is what I didn't like. You think 1.2 gbs would be enough but every level, it has to download more so I deleted it.",5
It really is any and every Mobil game based on chance rolls.,3
Underrated,5
Good game so far but can't create a room to progress in the game so I'm literally stuck.,4
Good game overall,5
"Unbelievable. Less than two months after Shigeru Miyamoto said that he thought microtransaction ""f2p"" games were bad, Nintendo releases this. I play a lot of gacha games, and this one has the most absurd of any I've played. I reroll using 10 instances at once, and out of the twenty rolls I do per session, I get two, maybe three 5-star items out of 200 pulls. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there are three categories of ""5 star"" items, and one of them is a useless ""wyrmprint"" that simply boosts stats for characters. And yes, you guessed it, the wyrmprint is 5 times more likely to be pulled than the characters or the dragons. So when you see that rainbow colored summoning ritual, don't get happy just yet; it's probably a troll. This game is a pure scam. Look up the history of Cygames and you'll see. Just Google ""Granblue Fantasy Scandal."" Stay away.",1
The graphics are so on point and very cool game to play with friends,5
The game is fun and nicely done! But I dont want to deal with the constant download every chapter.,2
"The graphics and music are good, but with an even less rewarding summoning experience than FGO (0.5% rate for a five star adventurer in comparison to FGO's already abysmal 1% rate for an SSR servant), I'll have to pass on this game. It doesn't help that the gameplay (from the tutorial) is kinda bland and repetitive. Plus, premium currency is extremely expensive, even when compared to other gacha games (one multi is around $32). Another huge drawback is having to download around 1 GB of data relatively often, probably for most maps/quests.",2
Amazing I have nothing bad to say I love this game 100℅ but I sadly have to stop playing it😫 reason being is that each lvl needs memory and it's killing my phone storage it suck!!! Please some how fix that cuz this is the only game that needs waaaay to much memory to play plus each lvl needs more some how fix it and I'll gladly change my comment 100℅,5
"It was a great game, then it got to the co op tutorial and wouldn't load a room so I can't play it any more",3
p2w,3
"Great Everything! Sounds, Music, battle tactics, 3D Graphics. A Must have then SW!",5
Very fun game not too different from fire emblem heroes but still it's own thing,5
"Honestly, when I heard about the game, I thought it was just going to be like your typical RPG and I would get bored of it in no time. Going in initially - and actually playing through the story made me realize it was more than that. And I found myself really enjoying the game, much more than I initially anticipated. And the music was odd at first, but it really stuck with me - haha.",5
Too me it the strongly addiction of action one it's a double thumbs up,5
The game is fun to play and rather generous with the in game currency.,5
I love everything about it. The story the characters and the adorable dragons,5
Good,5
"Great game, great graphics, good story",5
I enjoyed it and love the lore only problem is the grind to get stronger to progress,5
Great game Nintendo! This is a very entertaining game.,5
"It is a nice concept and has potential, however several things were annoying. Having to download each level, the controls to break shields is awefull, and the thing i disliked the most is that the healer cant heal when needed... has to fight a lot to use ability, sooo i cant heal unless i run around as the healer",2
Awsome game grate story and dragons,5
It's honestly a good solid game. Basically everyone is viable too!,5
very chodey,5
It's amazing I love the game alot all I just hope for now is for the creators to come out with a new update to patch the part of the tutorial where you have to do co op mode and create a group but the problem is that it never loads every time I click on it so I hope Nintendo is able to fix that cause that would be awesome,5
"Bad controls, good graphics, catchy music and boring gameplay.. No, thx..",2
"Great game, but has a horrible gacha system, p2w feel, and no pvp.",1
"The game is amazing first of all. Nintendo, you guys did a great job at making probably the best rpg game on mobile. But my only complaint is that when you unlock co-OP and it makes u search for a party. It just gets stuck searching for one even tho it says for the first time it will put me with AI. Please fix this bug and I will gladly rate 5 stars.",4
I'm sorry but right now it's all 1 star cuz it keeps saying no connection even tho I have perfect connection. It's really annoying and I wanna play It rlly badly,2
Another work of art from Nintendo. Keep making Arpg games!!,5
Booooo,1
"Its not inherently bad but I think its a bad gacha game. 2D looks better, is easier on the battery, etc. Definitely playable but I found little enjoyment from it. Hopefully others can get some enjoyment out of it.",3
Love it,5
I voted 5 cause the game is really fun to play. My only problem is that if you play for more then 4 days you run outta ways to get wyrmite really fast. Please put in more ways to get wyrmite!!!,5
"Horrible, two days now and I'm still stuck at chapter 2 Creekside because of the bug. And because the game forces you into it, I can't even collect my daily rewards or collect my rupees at my castle. Thank god it still marks off my rewards and gives them to me, but now they're just stuck in my inbox because I can't get out of this mandatory sequence that locks up the game and just starts over again when you reload the game.",1
Good Game but the Team AI is extremely Low IQ.... Its really bad and frustrating. Other than that cool game. Please make the AI Smarter!,3
"It's a Japanese Gacha game. The rates aren't all that bad but could be better. The game is generous giving you the freemium currency. Nintendo essentially took all that worked on every other gacha game, minus the controlls, and put it all in one game. This can end up in the game feeling overwhelming for most people.",5
Everything you'd want from a mobile game and more. Standout award goes to the amazing music,5
"it's a very good game all around. however, just maybe an hour into the game, you are told to set up an online co op lobby as a tutorial, but my game freezes when i create said lobby. i cannot progress in the game because i am required to complete this tutorial. please fix i am playing on a samsung galaxy s8",4
Absolutely love it.,5
"Great game, but lots of farming. Having issues with Co OP play. Unable to create room or join games",5
I like it,5
Amazing,5
"This is a great throwback style rpg that should get 5 stars. Unfortunately Nintendo failed to account for in game trolls having the ingenuity to find a way to ruin it for folks. From launch, and now the first event is ruined by them. Please listen to the feedback about co-op host controls!! If they fix this problem, I will rate the game 5 stars and leave a proper review.",2
"There's far roo much that is bad about this game that outweighs the good. Pros: Music is good Characters are cute Gameplay can be fun....when it works Cons Not optimized for Android at all. Controls are terrible. Gatcha rates are pure garbage tier. Team AI may as well not be there. Unfair Stamina System (you have 6 wings to co op, good mission cost 2, playing solo isn't a realistic option because team AI is so terrible) You Must Be A Whale To Get Anywhere (If you're not spending money, the game leaves you in the dust. Current raid requires certain types of characters maxed out or close to it or you will not get in a co op.) So many currencies to enhance your characters (gold, wyrmite, elderwater, mana, and materials for crafting or upgrading buildings in your castle) I could go on, but you who are reading this will get the picture. Hard pass on this game.",2
"Broken. The game is currently permentaly stuck trying to teach the Co-op function, but that just causes it to lag and glitch out. Am stuck. Also, basically this game play is literally just Pokemon Rumble. That's all. If you have played that, you know how this works.",3
"One of the worst gacha games. They guarantee a certain character through a welcome pack, but don't even check for duplicates. Total rip off. Stay away.",1
"As someone who has enjoyed playing Granblue Fantasy, it was really easy getting into the mix of things as various aspects were similar (ie gacha mechanics, co-op raids, upgrading, etc.). Even for someone who has never played GF, it's still fairly easy to get into and the tutorials are abundant but not too overwhelming. There's a feature here and there that you won't get right away unless you poke around but other than that, the game is pretty solid. Music is great as are the visuals. Controls and AI are a bit wonky but nothing game breaking as far as I can see. I've got high hopes for this collaboration.",5
"Great game, anyone who is a fan of mobile games should give it a try.",5
the story and characters are good but the overall gameplay and controls are lackluster. The gameplay isnt very good to begin with and on top of that it's very repetitive,4
"Amazing job done with a tried concept, good work nintendo.",5
"This game is perfect develop from gameplay, music to design is simply a master piece. Once you start you are not going to be disappointed. Amazing Job in this one. ❤",5
"This game is sooo good, the art, the music I love it all",5
"You need download 1.5gb ingame, and thats with slow speed, after beating tutorial you have to download more 50mb and thats way slower, the control really annoying. Try it yourself im uninstalling",1
"I love almost everything about this game after playing nearly two weeks. The only problem have run into is with purchasing the recovery pack. I can't ever use it because can't use the wings fast enough, so have wasted the money spent to get 100 stamina daily for 30 days.",4
"It's a great game, really... The plot is interesting, the gacha system is nothing new (I've seen stingy ones, ughhhh), and the gameplay was fine. It just didn't really click with me... Putting a 4* cuz that's what it honestly deserves, but uninstalling it...",4
No pay for win. Nice game,5
"Addictive, Fun, and easy to get into.",5
This game is fun but it's kind of annoying that I have to download EVERY level,5
"I realy like the game as a whole, it's an amazing game!! The only thing is, I haven't been able to get past co-op because it wont load for me plz fix",4
Game stops on tutorial on co-op battle,2
Needs alot more work and fine tuning,3
"Game is great. Great Story, Graphics. Ect. Lots of the reviews here are silly. People are complaining about Data and It not working. How about buying a new phone and stop trying to play new age games on your iphone 4S. Ive had no issues whatsoever.",5
"Gamr is a bit buggy but otherwise, its a good game.",5
"the controlling style is horible, storyline is bs, too much stuff to upgrade, in game purchase is more expensive than other game. the only pros for this game is the opening song is really good.",1
"Music, voice acting and art/animations are all amazing. Could very well be a 3DS game if it wanted to.",5
"First and foremost, it's VERY polished. The soundtrack is excellent and catchy. The visuals are very bright, and while very cute, can also be quite actioney. The voice acting is solid, and the lore for the characters is as well, and almost everything in the game has some amount of interesting lore. Surprisingly, the MC is great and likeable. Oh and the character designs are great. Raid is a lot of fun to play. The campaign story is competently written, better than 90% of gacha games. It's a lot of fun.",5
Best regards game on the mobile,5
"It's fun and rewarding in the beginning, but once you're disappointed with the abysmal summon rate, you'll move on to the next game unless you're willing to pay to win.",2
"The presentation of Dragalia is really nice, the music and graphics are soothing and the characters are very likeable. The combat is satisfying and a step up from the usual turn based RPG fare, but a bit shallow and boring since move pools are limited and enemies are very weak. Among gacha focused games this is definitely my favorite, it's just too easy and simple currently. Dragalia focuses more on grinding to level up your strength and equipment more than improving at the action mechanics, so things get repetitive fast despite the fun core. The raid event currently going on encourages endlessly chopping away at the same two bosses, neither of which are hard. The castle feels very lacking in customization options as well but I feel the potential for it to grow! With some more care put into the combat and dungeons it has the potential to be truly great. I recommend giving it a try and playing through the story to see if you enjoy it!",4
"I liked the game up until i was at 2.2 and the game froze/crashed. The worst part is that it's one of those tutorial part where i cant skip so even i restarted the game and the phone, it just brings back to the same place where it crashes. I contacted the help team but still no reply. It's a shame.",2
"simple control , great storyline and characters",5
Great game,5
Good for now,5
The combat controls are god awful.,1
"This game would be amazing if the summon rate of 5 stars wasnt so garbage. To top it off you have to compete against dragon and card rares too. So on top of already a trash chance of getting a 5 star rare, its also a 33% chance to get a hero 5 star. About to quit this game. Spent a lot of money on this get already and havent gotten a single 5 star hero from summoning.",3
Stick to FeH,2
Summoning Rates make me wanna die. Good game.,5
Was a good game until I arrive to coop . The game doesn't let me continue without doing coop and it does not let me back out or go to the main menu.,1
Gatcha paradise if you like to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get anything decent.,1
I'm stuck on the event screen tutorial it's just a infinite loading screen so fix this get better review.,3
Might is Right,5
Cool game concept and promising concept but as for now pretty disappointing im terms of gameplay,2
"amazing gameplay, amazing soundtrack, but lots of space required. love it!",5
Stick to console games Nintendo.,1
I think the game is great but like many others the models are all black and I don't know how to fix that so until its fixed 4 stars it what I give,4
"While the graphics are great, the story is awfully predictable and very slow. Each and every episode and cutscene must be downloaded, and they're usually about 1 GB each. It's the most glaring and annoying feature of this mediocre game.",3
Tutorial can lag and not load at times and cause the game to just be a bore and to be a quick uninstall,1
"Although it was a rough start, its a good game. I never played a mobile game where they patch things literally the day after and also giving free stuff for convience. Don't let the reviews deter you away from the game. Great music and graphics.",5
It's pretty cool! 👌👌👌,4
Lame. Boring. Over hype.,1
Good but too many things to download,3
"Very cool game... However, it bores me.",3
Love the game but co-op still doesnt work on my samsung note. Please fix so I can enjoy the raid!!,4
"Love this game! The story is fun and compelling, and there are loads of events and dailies. Doesn't feel like a game where you're forced to play all the time. Cool characters and nice dragons",5
It could be an amazing game.... But it's another gacha game.,1
"This game caught me by surprise, I'm so addicted...only game that's been able to dethrone dokkan battle lol",5
Cygames x Nintendo? Please take my money.,5
Yes the rates are unfair. But besides that this is a super fun game!!! Enjoying it so far but let's hope for lowered rates by Nintendo,5
I love the game I just can't get past the event co-op tutorial where you have to create the party but besides that I love the game,5
"To be honest, I really loved this game. I'm sad that the file size is so big so it impacts too much for me to have played much of it.",4
I like it even though I haven't tried it,5
Wow!,5
Boring and dull,2
"Amazing game,if I could,10 stars,great job Nintendo!",5
"Probably one of the best gacha ARPG's out there. Visuals and music are amazing, levels are fun and challenging as they go on, and the story is actually kind of interesting. The only thing that could use a bit of work are the controls. Movement doesnt feel right at the moment. That said, I still got used to it so its hardly an impossible setup. For the reviews saying theres a paywall, there isnt. You just need to actually play the game; utilize proper elemental characters, level up equipment (or forge better stuff), and join in co-op. Its not that hard.",5
"I mostly fell in-love with the background music and voice actors, The game has no problem at the moment, Loving it! :)",5
It's pretty good!,5
Love this game. Hope you guys can let friends send getherwings in the future. We love the co op aspect of this game,5
The game in it's self is very entertaining. I've got myself and other friends hooked. Only problem I have is the AI for you partner characters needs improvement!!,5
For the tourtal is taking quite long for to create a room,3
"I love dragons, anime, and Nintendo. Keep up the great work!",5
Fix ai,4
Best game. The only thing that I don't like is the odds of the summoning. They need to be way better.,5
Awesome game if you don't mind that it's gacha. Can still do really well as free to play only. This is gonna get big so get in on the ground floor!,5
Great story great graphics It's a really fun game the story was amazing the characters are great the bad part is that the co-op is really buggy and I can't play the rest of the game but great game though,5
Really enjoying the game. Bit slow for the start up but once co-op unlocks it speeds up a lot. The graphics are really nice and the character chapters are a really cute extra i didnt know i needed! (Being able to watch them again is also very nice!),5
I was impressed when the first main event hit. Good Japanese voice acting. Very likeable characters. And very lucrative rewards from the event that offset the somewhat low rate of the gacha.,5
There's so much to do I don't see the game getting old anytime soon,5
Its just a fun game!,5
"Very solid game. Lots of content already and all PvE focused with an emphasis on co-op. The writing and music are probably the best parts of the game. The story is off to a good start and each character gets their own side stories which are fun. Only negatives would be lower gacha rates on characters making it hard to get ones you want, controls that taking some getting used to, and the occasional server drop.",5
It ok but I dislike that you HAVE to download almost every chapter to get the 3D models,3
Can you fix the controls please? It would be a lot easier to have a moving trackpad instead of that stupid arrow to control characters. It's hard to enjoy the game when fighting the controls takes more concentration then fighting enemies.,4
"The games budget is amazing. They went all out to deliver a great experience. That is until you SUMMON. When summoning you have a chance of getting three types Wyrmprints (highest rate) Adventures (characters) Dragons (self explanatory) However the rates are in favor of WYRMPRINTS which have a tendency to pity break your RATE UP and leave you feeling like your hard work was for nothing. The rates are slightly more terrible than FATE GRAND ORDER if that helps any. This is a clear case of 80/20 (F2PvsWHALES) and they do this knowing well that if you want someone in particular, you'll have to reroll your butt off at the beginning. Now to be fair the 4* characters are helpful and can be upgraded to 5* but the work and material can only be matched by vanilla FIRE EMBLEM HEROES when it comes to upgrading them. Remember that hell? In my final words I say this. And listen well DEVS cause this is what people are saying about your game. If you have the patience as a F2P and don't expect 5* characters than fine, you'll need it. But if your a whale and or a semi spender stay clear of this game. It will only make you regret. If you don't believe me look up summons for the game on YouTube. Its mind blowing how they think they can get away with this.",1
"As a collaboration between Nintendo and Cygames, it's no shock this game is so polished. The gameplay and combat is fun, and gives the player full control over their character. Between leveling adventures, dragons, weapons, and wyrmprints, there's a lot of content to keep you busy. The ai and controls could use a bit of work, but don't stop this title from being a standout game.",5
"After an extensive week with the game despite it's few shortcomings, it's an excellent game that I can't get enough of. Lots of content, very forgiving developers whom offer generous compensation for their mistakes and errors, and a very enjoying game to play both casually and competitively due to the new rad system. Keep up the great work!",5
This game is amazing and the raids are so fun.,5
"A fun new gacha that doesn't rely on pulling good units, and instead lets you gain most of your progress through gameplay.",5
"Didn't expect much based on other rpg mobile games I've played in the past, but goodness I am hooked. Amazing game, Nintendo and Cygames!",5
"This is the best mobile game I've played. The action is fast and smooth, and the dungeons are short and fun. The brevity of the dungeons means that grinding isn't too much of a chore. My only complaints are with the VERY low roll rates (especially for adventurers) and the slow speed at which getherwings regenerate. I highly recommend this game.",5
Awesome,5
"Most of the reviews here are unfair. You should not be rating this game based of your own faults. Its not the games problem if your phone cant run the game, or if your phone heats up.",5
Very polished game,5
"Really fun game, big time sink",5
"I've never played a gatcha game before, so I was very surprised I ended up loving/playing this game so much. Mechanics are complex, but easy to learn. The story's decent, gameplay is addicting, and the j-pop music is catchy. My only beef is that a certain proud, strong character undergoes a complete personality change to become the same boring, generic waifu the game is already oversaturated with. Still giving 5 stars because Orsem and Orion are treasures.",5
"Deserves a higher reviews than what it's got. If you have a old phone, it might run poorly.",5
Awesome games. No issues at all on my side. Keep up the good work!,5
"Game looks great, combat takes a little to get used too and doesnt feel smooth on some classes and force strike can be a pain to activate properly sometimes, but dev team activity working and addressing concerns is great.",5
I don't like the directional setup. Character is all over the map. It be easier with a dpad,2
Super fun,5
"Its a wonderful game that I may have sunk too much time into. The story is absolutely wonderful and I can't wait for more of it to come out. The characters and thier backstories are also wonderfully designed and engaging, but I do wish there will be a chance to further expand each character than just the 5/2 stories. The gacha rates and premuim currency are a little on the more expensive side compared to Fire Emblem: Heroes, but the game provides plenty of wyrmites, the in game equivalent of the premium currency to spend on summons/rolls. As this game is fairly new, there are still a few quality of life changes that could be made, such as gatherwings (the coop stamina) refreshing at too slow of a rate/capped at too low of a limit, the high sensitivity of a hold attack vs moving, and how the lobby music loop is only 12 seconds of a great song. Please send feedback within the game itself if you want to see these changes and more heard by Cygames.",5
Granblue 2,5
Wasn't a bad game till I got to coop n it continues to freeze up...,2
"Wonderful game.  It's still new, so there are some technical hiccups and some balancing issues to work out, but so far it is very engaging and a lot of fun.  The combat is pretty fluid, and there is room for tactics and skill.  The gacha system is okay - wyrmprints taking a 5* slot in gacha pulls is lackluster, but there is a lot of care taken to balance the game in such a way that there are not really any worthless units.  Even the 3* units are worthwhile.  Unlike some other games like Monster Strike or PAD, where you might have a box full of units that you'll literally never touch, any unit in this game can be made strong for a given quest or event.  The premium currency seems a little too expensive, and the 5* rates (especially with wyrmprints in the mix) make paid pulls way too expensive to be worth it, but there are enough uses for the premium currency that keeping a bit of it on hand can be helpful.  I'm giving it 5* because of the polish, the thoughtful hero balancing, the great communication and updates from the dev team, and the overall engaging gameplay.",5
Had fun with this and thats whats important,5
"So many bugs on Android version. Clearly focusing development on iOS only. Game wise, balancing is pretty bad. Couldn't believe this comes out from Cygames.",1
"I usually don't like gacha games, but Dragalia Lost has me addicted with it's simple (yet challenging) combat and loveable characters. From the OST to the menu system, the game is just down right charming in every way. As far as gacha games go, it's pretty generous with it's currency for free players.",5
Fun,5
Games way better then the score would have you believe it had some 1 off bug at launch and people were mad about it it has long been solved and the games pretty fun requires plenty of space tho and the controls are kinda clunky altogether id give them a 4.2 outta 5,4
It's still in its early stages but as of right now it's super fun and upbeat. Will spend money if this trend continues,5
"I like this game. However when the ""Events"" section becomes available, the loading tutorial will not go any further, it just continues to ""load"" and won't allow me to do anything else.",3
"I usually don't do these reviews but this game is so great with so much potential that I had to do one. This game is great, yes it has it's issue like the lack of getherwings and raids not having a might requirement. But this game is still very new and over time that stuff will get fixed. So we just need to wait and send feedback to cygames and Nintendo and this game will be the best game ever.",5
"I enjoy the game for the most part except when it makes you pick CO-OP, it won't let me load and I cannot do anything else.",1
love the creativity the stories the characters etc. wish it was on ps4,5
"Great game, very well crafted and polished. Can see myself playing this long term",5
A beautiful rpg with shockingly deep combat mechanics similar to fighting games. Look into the SubReddit to find out more!,5
"The controls take a little getting used to, but everything is high quality. My only gripe right now is the lack of getherwings at the moment that's making it hard for co-op play.",5
"A beautiful game. Not particularly innovative but its systems are pretty fun. Group content is pretty cool, and of course the dragons are awesome.",5
It is awesome to have this game😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,5
"Horrible draw system that pulls from every item imaginable instead of what you want. Massive waste of time and gems to pull nothing that you want. Really want your money, whales only.",2
"This is a step in the right direction for Nintendo Mobile. The presentation is fantastic with music, 3D chibi models, 2D character animations, and interesting story chapters for both plot and characters. The action gameplay is great idea but there could some more fine tuning with the controls, maybe optional screen gamepad. Also summons rates don't need to be FEH levels but dragons and characters could be (1-2%) higher, c'mon. Lastly, co-op is great but cuts off easy even with good internet.",5
Great game but I can't continue the room creat won't load so I can't complete the tutorial,4
Amazing game fun to play I can tell the dev's put work into this game. It has one if the best music sound tracks In a mobile game and not pay to win.,5
"The game's great fun, and there's a bunch of content to keep you busy. Keep in mind, this game just barely became playable a while ago, so it may have some issues. Just give it time. They're working on it. Also, this is a gatcha game, so expect random character/dragon drop rates. But with how generous the early-game rewards are, it's not all that big of a deal. Sure you can reroll for those optimal drops, but you're bound to get good summons eventually.",5
Lovely game fun,5
"Great game. Fix the multiplayer crash so we can keep playing! I'll update my rating then Edit: Bug's fixed, and so is my rating. Great game, keep it up!",5
"Amazing. Been playing since day 1. Haven't had many issues besides small bugs that I foresee being taken care of in the coming weeks. Every aspect of the game is very polished and feels great. Also, I think people need better phones. Can't say I've had any crashing issues yet. Great work Cygames and Nintendo!",5
Its an interesting gacha with interesting gameplay.,4
"First ever review just because it's getting so many undeserved low ratings. Game has great graphics, a lot of depth, a nice story, and a wonderful Dev team who listens and cars about the player base. Couldn't recommend this game more",5
Add a female playable character. You don't make a self insert then just put one boring ass pasty dude as the only look option. Even Dx2 has gender select.,1
"Absolutely excellent game. It's unfortunate that so many people left low ratings over problems that have already been fixed. Ever since I started I haven't been able to put this game down, it's such a blast.",5
"Gameplay is fine, characters make me smile and music is nice pretty good",4
Everthing is beautiful but the problem i have right now is that I'm seems to get stuck on creating/finding room coop. I hope you can fix thqt problem so i can rate you up,3
There's a download every. Single. Level. How do you screw up a game that badly? If you have crappy wifi or were planning on playing this on the go and don't have a good data plan it's unplayable.,1
"I love how each character and dragon has back stories, and the story mode is event full. But as soon as I got to the event tutorial, that's where this went south fast. The game forces you to go to events if you accept the tutorial. Once in the event mode it prompts you to start a lobby, once doing so the game freezes and doesn't allow any other action. I thought I could simply back out, but no. If I reset my game it sends me back to the same loop of commands. Quite a shame really. I was almost enjoying my self.",3
Amazing. 9ó,5
"I can't get behind the control scheme but I like the game for the most part. Not very reliant on in app purchases, which is a huge plus. I feel this game has potential.",4
Server stability is terrible.,1
Co-op keeps crashing.,2
"Got addicted to this game quickly. Love the character, dragon and monster designs. Interesting story and great music. Hopefully Nintendo at least considers a Switch port with more comfortable controls ( movement is awkward and not as responsive as it should be ). Unfortunately it crashed my phone while working on unlocking the event character and now it just loads to a blank white screen...",4
This game runs well on my note 8. I am having 0 issues and I just finish chapter 3. The game is very addicting and this free. Co-op gives this game a nice twist!,5
Great game just sucks that you need to sync Nintendo account and can't recover even if you couldn't set it up due to a bug. Great way to lose money and time.,2
"I love this game so far and how easy it is to pick up and play, especially without having to turn my whole phone around. I also love the soundtrack, DAOKO is definitely one of my favorate artists and the fact that I can listen to her music through the soundtrack is what I love the most!",5
Super fun!!!! Low rating was due to bugs on launch. The reviews were not updated. This game is legit amazing,5
It pretty good,5
"I was kind of worried this would be just another boring gacha game, but oh was I so wrong. The game runs smooth as butter on a hot pan and it's actually pretty fun once you get the hang of it. I've never been so hooked to a mobile game as this one and I really hope more people find out about it and join. For a new mobile IP, I believe Nintendo and Cygames (better remember that name, awesome developers) really hit the spot.",5
"This game is great overall and the gameplay is smooth and addictive but I hope u can drop the cost of currency for multi summons. 1500 is way too much for a multi. And another prob is the connection. Everytime I try to find a co-op mode in the events, its stuck on the loading screen. I hope you fix that up real quick so I can grind the event.",3
yea no I couldn't even play the game and I already hated it,2
"I really love the game, but the welcome pack was HIGHLY dissapointing. I spent $25 on a 5 star summon and I got a copy of the ONE 5 star adventurer I already have. To top that off it ONLY gives you 3000 eldwater in the place of a 5 star which isnt even 1/4th of what it costs to promote a 4 star. I would really appreciate if someone could please reach out to me, because I feel scammed.",4
Love love it,5
Great game learning curve for the first like 2 chapters but after that it feels fluid,5
"Nearly everything about the game is rather well done. The characters are very anime trope; and you all make it quite obvious this is an anime trope filled game. That being said, the overall gameplay is better than anything I've played. The sorting of items, characters, and so on. The game has essentials for farming in another menu while farming from missions. I honestly love this game. The only thing I'd change is the slide controls. Sliding to dash is perfect but sliding to move is terrible as there's no focal point for the ""middle"". To me that's all it needs,a virtual analog stick",5
"Very VERY addictive, the graphics are very appealing and the gameplay is very smooth. This game is top notch.",5
Sucks,1
I like how you have a guy that can turn into a dragon,5
All I knew is that it's from Nintendo. And Nintendo's games are great. I haven't even downloaded it yet,5
Nintendo PLEASE TURN THIS TO A ANIME YOU'LL MAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY AND GET EVEN MORE FAMOUS,5
Nice job,5
"I think it's okay. Game looks appealing, music is catchy (and I greatly appreciate the option to turn vocals off), and there looks to be some delving into putting together a party of four. However, the controls can be unintuituve at times, with janky movement should I try to quickly change direction or perform a charge move; and the party AI has an odd tendency to stand around in damage zones and/or do nothing. I am also not a big fan of gacha where duplicates are necessary in order to maximize their potential. To leave off on a high note, it's pretty great how every character, human and dragon, gets their own little piece of the spotlight with writing to flesh them out beyond their visual design.",4
"The game has very catchy music, decent graphics, and a good story for a mobile game, but my complaints are that the moving controls can be awkward sometimes, the game really likes hogging space and the summon rates can be poor, but overall I really enjoy it and I'd recommend people to try it.",4
It's just a great game,5
Love it,5
Wayyyyy to much dialog if you wanna learn the story. Plus the control mechanic is really bad.,1
"I can't even play, I just get a black screen with a white pixel in the middle.",1
It is good enough,5
"So this is a story based game, but the store is the most generic fantasy anime plot I've ever seen, the voice acting is only slightly above bad, which is sad cause it's not good enough to enjoy, but not bad enough to laugh at. The menuing is slow and very clunky till you get used to it. And the game play is only okay. Also if you play this game expect to hit a pay wall, I see some people saying it doesn't exist, but in my experience it does, I mean I guess it technically doesn't because if you just grind your ass off on the same boring missions over and over again the wall goes away but.... That's not very fun. The games okay, but it could be a lot better, it's basically just slightly more complex Pokemon Quest. Edit: since I've written my review I've become quite addicted to this game. All my points stand true, but my brain clearly likes something about it...",5
Its gud,5
"As soon as I saw the ad for this game,I wanted it and it's really good.thx Nintendo!!!",5
It's a great game. Ive been reading other people's reviews and it seems like you need a newer phone to play this cause of the graphics and storage space but overall it's a great game. The combat is a little boring though but that's about it. Once they fix the bugs it will prob be a great game.,4
"Can you please increase the 5 i rates its sooooo bad, 7500 down the drain without no 5 star",5
Amazing and f all the fake voters that made tgis beauty go so down in rank,5
"Good game. Just personally wish the AI's didn't suck so badly, like when your attacking the just sometimes stand there and do nothing, usually that gets them kill but when u move they seem to snap back into action but other than that, it has a really good story, havent finished it myself yet, the dragons are amazing looking. Poli'ahu and Pele are my current favorite, though Poli'ahu has the cutest voice. But all in all I recommend the game for anyone",5
Great,5
Yay,5
Galaxy s9 music is amazing!!!! I love the animation. And random voice acting,5
"The start doesn't pull you in very well, i find myself very bored sometimes. The controlls are weird but easy to get used to. The graphics are stunning, the gacha aspect is moderately satisfying, i just cant get over how the story at the beginning fails to really be that pulling.",3
"There's absolutely no way a mobile game can be this good. Nintendo, you've done it again. I just wish the game had smoother controls and combos. Other than that, I'm pretty pleased with the game. Especially with the soundtrack.",5
"The controls are rough sometimes, and the multiplayer restriction is too tight, but the game is well crafted, and has a lot of room to grow well.",5
It not good because it not good,3
Game is stuck in a tutorial loop for AoT... has been for a few days now. Still get logging bonus then end of story for game.,3
"It took forever ever to download at it reset half way.Bad game Nintendo Co.,Ltd!",1
it wouldn't finish downloading and it told me I have an error at 1mb and won't finish downloading I can't play please respond,1
Pretty fantastic but it just freezes before you start chapter 2 when you have to do the tutorial on how to do co-op,4
Very fun game,5
Im stuck on the co-op tutorial. It won't load a room,2
I really enjoy this game especially these event raids playing and teaming up with my friends is the best part of this game. Team work is key on some of the tougher bosses. Hope more raids come in the future!,5
Can't even download this game at all. Doesn't even get past 2% before getting an error.,1
Won't even open. All it says is authentification failed then closes. Nice work Nintendo. Stick to console games... oh wait you suck at those too.,1
Boring game and really simple graphics and gameplay,2
Waited forever to load only to be let down,1
"I really like this game. It is fun and good job for both companies not making it feel like you have to pay. However, I have problems with all the new downloads. It makes the game take a decent amount of space. Just have it all download at once. Also, the controls. You need to move it slowly otherwise it will flip in a completely different direction. Other than that, great game, and keep up the good work.",4
"The first tutorial is actually good but the menu tutorial is a slog like most modern nintendo games, you can teach a player without directly teaching them look at megaman or super metroid they teach a player by giveing a situation and leting the player find out how to overcome and make expanded idas. Of the Puzle",3
"I was kinda expecting it to be a Breath of Fire rip-off, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fun game. Good work, Nintendo!",4
Love the game.. best of its kind.. co-op doesnt work yet though,4
Great but make better controls its hard to record a video,5
Okay,5
Is good,5
RPG with depth in building team compositions and gearing heroes. Engaging combat that challenges your knowledge with game mechanics and the kingdom building aspect is an addicting game mode that has you building structures that provide additional loot or buffs. Highly recommended.,5
I love the different stories. I feel there are some tech issues still and I do get 2-3 crashes a day from playing but over all it's fun and fairly generous with summoning points.,5
Can i get the dragon when you summon?,5
its a good game but the controls are a bit wonky you need to dowload the game in peices witch isnt good but other than that its good,4
Everything about it is great but for some reson it takes an eternity just to join a coop mach,5
"Didn't even play because you guys want me to download over a gig of data, i have had games that are way high in graphics and performance on my other device and they don't require nearly has much data to download",2
"It was great for about 5 minutes. Clearly isn't release-ready or optimized for mobile. Too many 1GB+ downloads for additional data, and the first character I unlocked had placeholder text for name, abilities, and dialogue!!",1
"The controls don't feel as smooth as I'd like, minor complaint. The main complaint is that the audio is crackling and popping on my Essential phone Ph-1, running pie and latest October 5th security patch update. If the issue gets resolved I'll change my review accordingly.",1
"I love this game, it's incredibly fun-- but it freezes and crashes so much that I can hardly play it some days. It also refuses to let me buy in game currency due to some error.",3
That's pretty good but where's Knak 3.,5
Waste of time,1
"Getherwings. It takes so many to find people and becuase of this at higher tiered missions it can take ten mins to find anyone. Many people are saying this is the main issue as it destroyed your ability to multiplayer when this is almost all the game is. The AI on solo is horrible while the enemies is off the charts, making running solo on anything bout the power mission near impossible. NEEDS TO BE ADRESSED AND FIXED.",2
"It is a lot better then I thought it would be, it should be on the switch or the 3ds so that it works and plays better!😀",5
"Nintendo strikes again, cute sexy characters and awesome dragons. Well played.",5
"Again, card rolling style games. The graphic is good. But the gameplay is just like a lot of other games. And rolling characters is addictedand costy, and which is not fun. Disappointed",1
"Great production values: Graphics are top quality and it's really nice to have decent music and voice acting. Gameplay is standard tap tap tap combat with little strategy aside from dodging away from aoes. Gacha rates are terrible, even for the featured summons, but the game is fairly generous with currency, thus far. The meta for the character customization does not seem that robust yet, either. Story is not really unique. There is a lot of dialogue and its filled with standard tropes. In all, it's a pretty, pretty average game with a dragon shape-shifting theme that runs well on a pixel 2 xl.",3
Good job big fan,5
Seems okay.,5
So cool 0,5
I love it but when you get to a part it where you need to creat a room for the event it wont load once you click the creat a room button,5
"Well, I can't say I really enjoyed it, with there being so many downloads, like at the beginning, and then another every time you go on a mission. Another problem was the controls and the attack method. And finally, I had to uninstall it because it wouldn't load after chapter three. All it would do was force me to make a room, and it would never load.",1
Fun game! I really enjoy the story line and the rpg aspect of it!,5
"Great game! Really fun mechanics, story, and game art. Definitely deserves higher ratings.",5
"The good: great story, graphics and controls. The bad: made it to chapter 4. Used all the upgrades for the previous chapters building element teams and now am too weak to continue with light and dark. Unless I pay of course or grind the first 3 chapters at length to continue. I believe I will uninstall now. Was a fun couple of days though. However, pretty disappointing now that I cannot continue.",3
"This game really disappointed me, honestly it's a 99% copied game from the Japanese mobile game . Sad to see the creative team of Nintendo get worse like this.",1
"For a new face for mobile from Nintendo I like it. Likable characters and awesome units with they're own stories , decent English voice acting and music that I guarantee will be stuck in your head before you finish the tutorial this is a game I enjoy wasting time with Main complaint moving in dungeons takes a bit to get used to the characters are very slippery if you played Luigi in Mario 2 you know what I mean.",5
"I would realy like to rate this app a 5 but i cant, i am no able to even play the game. As soon as it gets to the main screen it keeps popping up failed to connect to server over and over",1
This game has the best music of any rpg slasher ever. Plenty of depth and variety. The co op mode in all areas is fresh. Great little collection rpg that doesn't need you to empty your wallet to enjoy.,5
"Everything seems really well done. Graphics and sound is excellent. Mechanics seem good. My only issue is this doesn't seem like my cup of tea so to speak; not a fan of action RPGs on mobile, but wouldn't mind this so much on the Nintendo Switch. Going to put it down for now and maybe come back later.",4
This game is amazing but i can proceed foward from the tutorial. Im stuck when they make me co-op with other players and i cant do nothing,5
A Really solid game,5
"If you've played Granblue Fantasy or anything Cygames made then you'll feel familiar with this. If you like such games then you'll probably like this. If you don't like such friends like I do then you'll probably steer clear of this. Gameplay is mostly manually controlled although there is an auto function. However, the AI is no the brightest so it's to manual when necessary. The gacha rates are abysmal. Before deciding that this game wasn't my cup of tea, I decided to spend all 12000 gems(80 rolls) I've saved up into the gacha to see what I'd get. No 5* the entire time until the end where I got a wrimprint which is essentially a support item to just boost adventurer's stats. There is a pity system which increases your chances at 5* after 10 summonings but it's shared between adventurer(character you'll control), dragon(used for heavy/ultimate attacks), and wrimprint. Decide carefully whether or not you'll stay and pay as the prices are also ridiculous. However I will say that even 3* and 4* adventurers are viable as you can upgrade their rarity when you accumulate enough resources. Besides this are some nitpicks that may or may not be resolved at some time in the future. As this is a new game perhaps there'll be major changes. TL;DR: You like Cygame product? Then you'll love or hate this. Gacha rates are as bad as FGO, but like FGO, low rarity units are viable. The game is still new so who knows where the future lies ahead for it.",3
Really fun! Summon rates aren't that bad and almost all units are viable since it's PVE-orientated.,5
Great game awsome story but takes too much space,5
Can't even play the game ... It keeps failing to download. For a Nintendo game this is a crazy level of failure. Was my last time even come aideront a Nintendo game. Their quality is beyond deplorable.,1
Amazing and Addicting,5
I've done over 10 tenfold summons and I STILL haven't gotten a 5 star.,2
Event quest for 2-1 broke the game. Unplayable. Update: 0ct 6; game would not start up. Cleared cache. Still broken. Downloaded again. Save file gone. This app is trash.,1
"In short it's a boring gatcha game that feels more like a cash grab with a generic story attached. The pull rates are not that awful, you just have too many catagories going. There is nothing really special about this game. It's not bad, it a not good, it just is. Nintendo could not pull another fire emblem. Which this something this game feels like.",3
"Its story are good and make me curious about the heroes story forward. The controler kinda good but need more work i guess. And i hope theres more animation for specific charakter, not depends by it weapon. Overall its ok.",4
"Just so dreadful as a game. Notjing memorable that says ""play me!"" Was hoping for a real win her on Nintendo's Mobile ventures. But again it is just all flash and no substance on mobile.",1
"Not sure why this game has a low-ish score. From reading other reviews, it seems that people are just too impatient, or don't understand what a gatcha game means or know what that looks like. This is a fantastic game, and I'd recommend people to give it a try. While the controls are a little clunky at first, you eventually get use to them, and there is a surprisingly amount of tech that comes from the combat. The story is generic, but it is still well written, presented polished, and decently put together. Co-op is actually fun and engaging, which is rare in most of the gacha game market. Overall I'd say this game has a bright future, and I'm looking forward to seeing this game and the community around it grow.",5
"The music is catchy, the art is good and the game is decent enough. Unlocking the upgrade systems feels like it takes too long and I'm completely uninterested in the events that requires multiplayer play.",4
"Game literally broken with a major unresolved bug that hasn't been fixed 10 days after it was spotted, that stops people from taking part in events",3
"Recent raid boss is pretty fun fight. Kind of almost feels like an MMO RPG boss fight (without the MMO part). A lot of potential as there's only so much content for a brand new game. Definitely a graphics intensive game, so make sure you're playing on a decently beefy device! You can get by without 5* units, but definitely easier. 5* dragons probably matter much more, but there are some strong 4* dragons that can outshine the 5*s. This makes the game fairly F2P friendly (but you may miss out some of the extremely hard optional content). Wish there was a more detailed tutorial  For those who hate the constant downloads, you can do a batch download in the Settings>System>Download setting. Do this for every major content release to avoid downloading level by level.  I really wish the devs made this obvious. In general, most mobile games have the play store app as a downloader for the larger rest of the game.  For those with AI problems, one trick is that your skill animation make your AI invincible for a small amount of time, too. The AI WILL target whatever your unit is targeting, or run to you if you untarget enemies which is done on purpose and useful to know for major boss fights.",5
"This game is a masterpiece! Everything is so amazing to look at and play through, the music is AWESOME, I can see the massive amounts of care that was put into this game! Even down to the smallest details, I'm blown away by just how deep this game goes and I'm not even half way through yet! This game is a gem, it deserves far more recognition then it's currently getting.",5
"It's a great game in it's own rights , make sure you do the batch download to avoid having to download nonstop. Gatcha rates are a bit lower than the usual games , promoting units to 5* atm is very unfeasible, no good way to farm the eldwater (material to rank up) , their pricing for payed for gacha currency is a tad pricier than other gatchas as well , hope to see them make adjustments to the prices vs the summoning rates (yes we all know rng , but even they list them as lower than other gatcha rates for 5*s). Controls also need some improvement, a bit if a hastle even more so for melee , can still be workable but can be annoying sometimes. Another suggestion for ppl having issues , besides doing a batch download , turn the models to 2d instead of 3d , not as flashy but can help with stability......let's face it these are phones , not full blown computers or consoles , they have performance limits. Would love to see this come to the switch as well , I feel like its current controls would work better as is on there. I've read some comments about the constant download sizes......I can assure you those are MB , NOT GB........my storage confirms it is not downloading a few gigs every mission. I can only guess someone misread it or it is a sad attempt at trolling. I've got AzurLane and Girls Frontline taking up more space than this game , so again , said people mean MB , not GB.",4
"Great game, can see the time and effort put fourth just keep the updates coming regularly if you wanna stay in the up and up I'm sure people have already cleared most of the main content like myself and want more:D but other than the advice good job Nintendo",5
"No way I can have space for this game on my phone. Nintendo makes you think it's a small download beforehand, but once the ""game"" is downloaded it takes over 1GB to actually download. Suck town",1
"To be totally honest this game can get pretty repetitive, boring,the controls are weird too. And the gotcha part of the game is shown but with a terrible presentation the Banners are fine but the rates are disgusting, once you see you got a 5-star it's most likely going to be a card. Not a dragon or a adventure so this just destroys your hopes and dreams once you've spent most of your time grinding for those 1500 stones. And if you're thinking about buying Stones just remember it's Nintendo and they are greedy meaning you are going to have to waste a lot of money just for one multi just too then get disappointed by the things that you pulled. Another thing the fact the game took every single bit of my space on your phone other then that it has good parts too. Online is really fun (but can get boring) specifically the raids. The story is typical of an RPG but it's still entertaining, nice character development and some core aspects of gameplay are fun like the dragons. And there's much more that I don't want to pic at right now keep in mind some of these may not follow through to other players as this is my opinion and I found that most people agree with me other than that this is a game that you would consider downloading if looking to dive in to a game with good story that can take you into the world of Dragalia lost.",5
Would be 5 star but I cannot get past co-op. I just unlocked it and all it does is sit and load.. ive been stuck for 2 days now...,2
Yea I felt tired of playing after the fourth quest. Story was ok. Dialogue was enjoyable untill the story started to fall short . Then you realize you'll be grinding all day. Bummer . Looked like a great rpg. What happened Nintendo????,3
"This game is really cool. I personally love the character models and art and the voices really match the characters. However, I think what really makes me angry are the summon rates for 5 star characters. They are absolutely horrible. After three 10x summons I get three 4 stars and the rest were 3 stars. It Infuriates me so much that I haven't gotten more than one 5 star character after playing for more than a week.",5
Boring,1
"I want to finish this review, but I have to download another update.",4
I couldn't play it would freeze when you start it,2
"The story really picks up by the end of of chapter 2, the game is basically Granblue Fantasy with different combat. Not going to lie I would still prefer Granblue Fantasy to be at the English Play Store but this is a good happy go lucky version of Granblue Fantasy with 3D model Graphics. PS: This also takes alot of battery power.",4
Pretty good so far though co-op connection is a bit unstable and needs a bit of work. Guys it just came out theres gonna be a few kinks give the developers time to go over it. Chill. But the connection for the event makes it difficult to play,5
One of the best gacha games to date.,5
Love it,5
Awesome Free RPG! Great and smooth graphics plus controls. Nintendo never disappoints.,5
It's an amazing game to play if you're bored.,5
Cool game,5
I began playing today and when I learned of there being a co-op feature I was excited so after clearing 2-1 I was prompted to play the beginner avenue to power during this time I couldn't do anything other then what the game told me to but when I went to make a room it would never load even after I waited for hours so i'm essentially soft locked,3
"I am absolutely loving this game! The graphics are so well done and colorful, the gameplay is challenging and engaging, and I love collecting all the characters/dragons/wyrmprints. I gave the controls a 3 because I don't like how you move with your finger, it is very different from normal phone game controls and sometimes does not go the way you want, however you do get used to it. I've been obsessed from day one and love the extra character stories and comics, they keep me playing the game even when I'm not doing dungeons/raids.",5
"For being a new IP, this game is fantastic. As all gacha games, there's definitely room for improvement. But overall definitely worth playing.",5
Game wont even open,1
Their is a problem all the 3d things are all black and are just shapes with no color or face if any can fix this or if Nintendo is reading pleas fix it then I can play the game this is why I gave it 2stars.,2
"I want to like this game, but the oversimplified controls are terrible. Trying to move/attack/dodge is sluggish and sloppy because you have to stop doing one thing to do another since there aren't any on screen controls. This game doesn't really do anything new for the genre. You've done all this stuff before.",3
"So far I've had no problems with this game. Mechanics are great, no crashes no issues or anything. This game plays surprisingly well holding your phone in one hand and just using your thumb to control the game.",5
This is an amazing game,5
Great game except the Wing system is very flawed and clearly wasn't looked at too closely.,2
"Decent gameplay with a good story and history. The problem is that touch gameplay is a little off, also the loading screens are too frequent and too long. Even though the individual stories for each character are interesting and you get rewards it does not make sense to spend hours doing each one individually. Great start to what will be a fun game as it evolves.",4
I love this game and that's a lot to say cause I'm really picky but I can't go beyond chapter 2/2-1 as it gets stuck in an endless loading screen when it trys showing me how to Co-Op. Please fix this!,4
The summon rates are absolute trash everytime I think I'm gonna get a 5 star adventurer it's just a wyrmprint and I hate it,2
"My only gripe is that with Coop when it gives you thw tutorial to do so, takes Ages if not FOREVER to get it over with. So, in that aspect please make it quicker/easier to find a Tutorial Coop please 😣",4
"The storyline is great, but the controls can become a problem. My biggest issue with the game is the co-op connectivity. I was able to clear my cache then download the game, over and over again (not saying I'm happy about that), but now I cannot use the co-op, period. Tried restarting the app after clear my cache then downloading, tried restarting my phone after clearing the cache, and several other methods but nothing is working. This is especially detrimental since the recentevent requires co-op play. Until this connectivity issue is fixed, I'm rated it 3/5.",3
Tooooooooook way to long to download and the lag is real,3
"It's a great game, a little repetitive, very good feeling. Tighten up the movement a little so your not rolling all the time, but it feels great. The little character stories are a incredible addition to the basic gotcha phone game.",4
Really needs work on getherwings. They are way too limiting.,4
"Couldn't even load, 1.5gb of additional files and no support for background download... The download speed of the server was super slow. Waist of time",1
Only have one issue right now other wise I would rate 5 stars co-op wont create the room so I cant continue to progress I have cleared the cache and re-updated it in game but still wont load that part,4
It's fun,4
I'm having trouble with coop mode but everything else is works good,4
"This game is amazing, some slight critiques I could give would be to add an option for additional AI control but other than that fantastic game I've been hooked since installing.",5
Its pretty good,5
This is a fun gane only feedback i leave is can u make it easy to move your chr on phone it will hard to move then around when try to fight at the same even time u try to trun a core your chr run the other way if y can add a d pad options on the option screen so u can switch between both so people have a easy time of move around other then that it a fun game so that why i put as 4 star because it a bit hard to move around,4
Fantastic game! Highly recommend playing it!,5
Amazing!,5
I love dragons!!! Thats basicly why i downloaded this game lol,5
Fix the controls,5
Love it keep up the good work,5
Very fun game. Devs are super responsive during the first week and compensate nicely.,5
Really like it,5
It's fun,4
Ioved it,5
Everything i could want in a gacha!,5
It's a great game but I am stuck in a glitch to go into events but it won't load a party for me,4
Great game. Only thing missing is guilds.,5
"This game is a lot of fun. My friends and I can't seem to put it down. Raids are WoW/FFXIV style and can be very fun. Ai can be dumb at times and draw rates suck. However, as a f2p player I've drawn about 15 ten draws so it's been pretty fair for me.",4
"Fun game, it being an ARPG keeps it engaging. There are a few small quirks to get used to such as movement but it plays well. So far I haven't felt like I needed to spend money. Keep it up Cygames.",4
Coolest game ever,5
It needs an xp event for the characters. That would be really helpful. I cant play all day since i work all the time.,5
The game is really fun. Make sure to link your account because customer support is just awful.,3
"This game shows the huge difference and huge gap between a top tier development studio like Nintendo versus other mobile game developers who are just in it for a quick cash grab. This game is by no means cheaply made. It's quality shines with having top tier graphics running at a smooth and consistent 60 frames per second, having simple yet responsive controls and surprisingly decent voice acting along with high quality J-pop music. This is a shining example of how to make a mobile game the right way rather than putting little effort and just copying and pasting someone else's game just for a quick cash grab. Dragalia Lost respects quality over anything else, and it's what makes this game stand out far above other mobile games that have similar concepts and gameplay.",5
"For a game that features multiplayer as a core of its gameplay experience, that should be one aspect that should work but sadly its buggy.",1
"The game is so big, that my phone literally couldn't take it anymore and just busted its memory, and $50 had to fix it...my phone has 30gb and not even that could hold the game.",1
Just another cash grab. 100 rolls with nothing it's just the beginning. 500 rolls with nothing you want ll soon be your daily.,1
"Controls aren't smooth, combos don't transition well, and wyrmprints really aren't beneficial enough to deserve to be in the gacha",1
"I give this game a four because the story and the side stories of the characters and dragons are interesting. The artwork is beautiful. The voice acting and music is great, and many gachas could take note from this game. The gacha rates are no worse than any other gacha game. My only issue with the game is the co-op needs to be patched immediately, for everytime myself and other players try to join co-op sessions and/or create co-op rooms the game freezes/loads endlessly. The game would have received a 5 from me if not for the co-op issue. *update The game is now 5 Star worthy. The online co-op bug seems to not be an issue anymore. The customer support team was swift in responding to my issues with the game. The free character event is sweet.",5
Its pretty good,5
It's a good game is just that when they have you create a room that's only how far you can get if they want to go any further,3
Great game might have its bugs but keep in mind its only been like 8 days so far so yeah thats expected to happen.,5
"This game is amazing. I love the music, the charterers, the story is interesting. Everything about it has been great. Only issue I've had is it tends to crash on my phone, cause it's an older model.",5
"This game is amazing! The art, music, voice acting... It's all very polished and impressive. There's so much to upgrade and so many side stories and characters to get to know. And best of all, there's co-op so you can play with friends! I highly recommend it.",5
"While the gameplay itself and the story are both a bit generic, the real magic of this game comes from the feeling it gives off. Units feel more like real characters and get actual personalities and backstories, the upgrade systems feel unique with the different types of equips, and the dragons and ability cards called ""wyrmprints"" get their own pieces of lore that make the ingame universe feel more expansive than any other gacha game. Art is lively and really makes the game pop while the upbeat music is catchy and addictive to listen too. Even if the gameplay itself is basic it's good enough to keep the game from getting boring and the only real problem I run into is the controls feeling a little awkward from time to time. Luckily the good vastly outweighs the bad and overall this turned out to be a spectacular phone game.",5
"Story / World building are pretty good . Colorful cast of characters, Dragon Transformations and decent controls add to the overall fun of this game .",4
Game looks very polished but AI is terrible and it's almost impossible to reliably auto content well below your might.,3
Try to replace the controls with new one becasue it hard to move from place to another,3
I cant get past the co-op loading screen. I've uninstalled and cleared all game data many times to see if helped. Nothing works and I just want to play the game,1
I love the game but it freezes ever couple quest,4
"Ive downloaded it a couple of time and still recieve an code error: 400, what should i do? i have a Samsung Galaxy 7",1
Game is a lot of fun and really polish as its a lovechild of nintendo and cygames. Only real issue is the atrocity of 1 wing per 1hr. Really lamed the point of doing co-op as leveling slows down a lot so you have to shell out real money at thos point of the game.,5
I don't understand this kind of games. There's text skipping and random screen tapping. Nothing fun like games suppose to be.,1
It's ok,3
"I think this is a fun game. Great music and graphics, Gameplay feels good as well. A bit on the repetitive side, but I don't mind.",5
It's a great game but for some stupid reason I can't get past the avenue of power tutorial. It tells me to create a room then doesn't load cheap. So essentially I'm stuck in that loop till the next update or something is fixed.,4
It's really fun with only a few bugs,4
This game has brought me the most enjoyment out of all the phone games i've played controls are easy too.,5
The rates on this game are absolute trash. It's common to go 6-7 10x rolls (~$200) without even seeing a single 5 star. And the majority of the time the 5 Star will be some junk filler card.  Trash rates AND trash 5 star fodder. Wow nintendo must really be desperate to gouged the living daylights out of you folks.,1
"Sometimes things don't work when I click on them. I'd press the button for the main menu and it would do absolutely nothing. I'd try to read part of the story and I can't click for a period of time. Still, everything else is rad.",5
"Game needs an in game download of 1.56 gb, didn't even get to play the game. I was super excited to play it too. :(",1
Cant believe how Hard it is to move forward,3
I really like this game but it froze on the co-op tutorial and wont let me play.....,3
"If my name represents the protagonist, then I would really like the option of choosing their gender.",3
Can have dragon waifus.,4
"This game is really great. I enjoy it throughly. I think the only thing holding it back for me is the fact that the ""AI"" needs to have better mechanics for targeting. There are alot of crucial moments where your team is simply standing still or charging directly into fire pits. Its very bad. Another point to fix is the optimization. Its pretty good. I think it just could be a little cleaner. Other than that, it has a good start. I look forward to the updates. Please fix soon.",4
This game lag and sometimes glitches on itself. The controls are hard to use because there's no joystick. The attacks are lackluster and trying to aim an attack on and enemy is hard because the game is sensitive. The designs and story is good but the game play itself is really bad.,2
"If it is a team play Jrpg with actions, then it would be much better if the teammates are much more active and responsive during the fight, and stay on target more so that they don't keep on coming back to our main most of the time ( which is so annoying and pretty helpless over all)! Even our main ( the one that we player control are quite not so responses too while attacking), the whole doesn't feel smooth or fast paced enough. If the foes can attacks with fluently & smoothness and almost no pausing whatsoever, then why are we players are so bad in action? Is like we are being held back for whatever reason! Also, it is a big NO NO that foes won't BUDGE when you're attacking it which is the bad, and even worse is that we lose HP while attacking the foes or under attacks ( and skill didn't give us immunity at the moment of cast). And so, healing has became a joke( especially when it isn't heal over time).",2
"The game was awesome, until It stopped giving me the adventurers from my summons. I performed a 10fold summon and got a 5 star, but none of the summons showed up. Everything just disappeared. 1 star until this is fixed.",1
Unexpectedly addicting!,5
"People that say boring... Bet they get beaten to a pulp, honestly one of the things this game requires is skill... And those complaining about not getting 5*... you are just obsessed with rating, this game big difference respect other gachas is that you dont need to get multiple copies of the same unit. Also, some people have already proven that 3* units promoted to 5* can solo beat hard bosses if you are skilled. Play with the units you like...",5
Fails to connect after first use,3
The Waifus,5
it cool im concept idk how much ill play it,4
"Music is good coupled with the cute chibi character models. However, Auto Mode and for characters on the team you are currently not controlling, the AI script for both needs to be improved for better gameplay experience.",5
Feels like a mix of suikoden and secret of Mana. There are p2w aspects. However haven't paid a cent and I'm keeping up with the event's expert mode. Haven't used any of free premium currency either and have hoarded close to 15k. Got my first 5* character from some random draw and the event's 5* dragon. A few 5* wyrm picture thingies.,5
It's a cool game should make mor,5
"Good graphics, ok (if not seemingly copy-pasted from fire emblem) story, characters that seem less flat than they could be for a gacha game, and overall more interesting than I expected",5
Polished looking game with absolutely no depth in the gameplay. You literally just press the screen to attack and occasionally roll to dodge. That is about it.,3
Love the music,5
"On Apple devices it runs way smoother than Android devices it's a huge difference in how it performs, how it looks, and latency please fix",3
"Great game. The controls can be just a tiny bit clunky. Also i wish the gacha didnt have wyrmprint, units, and dragons all in the same gacha. Aside from that the game is fantastic!!!",5
Nintendo could do soooo much better...... bleh,1
Fun,5
It's so playful that I want to play it all my life,5
First time,5
Gr8 game,5
Love it and its not bad,5
To lagey,1
"Great game, really enjoying it but it freezes in the co-op event tutorial and I can no longer play. Had to restart twice and keeps freezing.",2
Graphics are amazing,5
It's great,5
Its lit,5
"Ok so now I know why the game has 3 stars. I really enjoy EVERYTHING about the game, but now I'm stuck at level 4 because the game won't create the tuitural room. This is sad, I have a s8. Can you guys please fix this ???.......nvm I resolved the issue. I had to reinstall the game and not click on the batch downloads. It's like I had to download the tutorial patch or I'd get stuck.",3
"I think this is a great game, fantastic art style. Story is super fun. Systems could be tweaked a bit but overall very happy with it so far.",5
Amazing game but co-op wont load making raids impossible for me please fix,5
This game is amazing,4
Make the controls better,4
"It's been a long time since I was this addicted to a game. Sure it's your typical Gacha type playstyle, but I actually quite enjoy it for its simplicity. Big props to Nintendo for making a game that keeps my attention for more than 10 minutes and on a phone app no less lol. #fanboy #addicted",4
If only co-op was unlimited. Why is the best part of the game being limited?,5
"The is great I love it, it can improve still have a few bugs but overall experience is great",5
"Can't pass the ""create a room"" ""coplay"" tutorial",4
Great Game,5
Im sure i would play this on a hand held console with better controls. But not on a touch screen with inferior control.,3
"It look like shiro neko project ,but this",4
"Gameplay is decent. Could use a little work. Characters and story are pretty good. Although in-app purchases are definitely part of this game, so far I don't feel compelled to buy stuff to complete stages in the game or to get decent characters and dragons. Seems easier to grind than in some other mobile games. Also, lots of content keep the game interesting. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than a lot of other mobile games? Yes. Also, the translation/localization is excellent. Probably the best I've seen in a mobile game from a Japanese developer. Yes, that should be expected because Nintendo is the publisher, but it's still notable. Enjoying the game a lot overall.",4
"Great game, good graphics. However it takes up a lot of storage and drains your battery pretty quickly. I wish there was a way to delete the previous levels/stories to reduce the data it takes up.",3
It's a really good game but I'm stuck at create a room tutorial it takes way too long to load and it's really annoying me I ended up waiting an hour but it still doesnt load,4
This game is awesome. Can this app have a wireless bluetooth controller settings? Thank you,5
Mobile games have no business being this fun.,5
nice,5
"Critical Review: The space it will take up on your phone is ridiculous. As well as lag in areas you do not have wifi or good data. Even in good areas it has a slight lag. The graphics are absolutely amazing and while that's a great plus, controls should have gotten the same treatement. Movement tends to become harder in lag spiked areas. You cannot turn once you've begun inputting your attacks. Lastly, the story is simple but the characater stories and amount of such make this game. Sadly, I had to delete this app due to the sheer amount of space it took up on my phone. If any associates of Nintendo and this app see it, PLEASE make it on the 3DS or 2DS as a downloadable app. It would do so much better there. Maybe just make it a game with crossplay between cellular devices. If that cant be the case, to all of those who still play. Be prepared to lose all of your space on your phones or devices.",3
"I think this is a perfect, F2P friendly, hero summoning masterpiece. If your phone sucks... don't leave a bad review... If your phone gets disconnected... your service provider sucks... Don't chase people away with low stars...",5
"Nothing like getting stuck in the Creat a roon glitch that you cant even get out of cuz tutorial makes you do it, I grinded so much just to have to uninstall, so much wasted time, gave it a week for them to fix the glitch but nope, added a new character instead, don't waste your time",1
Let's start with the good. I love the graphics and overall story is decent. Now let's get to the bad. First it is a huge download. I am never a fan of games that do a small download just so they get you to their download servers and they hit you with the large one. The initial is 87megs but as soon as you start the game it requires you to download a 1.3g file. That's not all. That will only allow you to do the prologue. After that it's another 150meg to just do the first stage of the first chapter. Now you can change the settings to batch download the whole file (if you don't then each stage is a meg or two to download) this is another 750+ meg file for the rest. So altogether you are downloading a 2+gig game. The controls are clunky. There are times when you are trying to move in a particular direction and it simply wont go that way even when you finger is squarely in the middle of the screen and it is going nowhere close to the edge. I found keeping track of the party at times difficult. The other thing is I have selected English but yet the notifications are in a foreign language (I have to assume Japanese) Overall it just is not staying on my phone because of the massive file size.,2
When's the first update?????!!,5
Love this game! Great graphics and the character speak actually words! The music in it is phenomenal as well. Awesome job.,5
Love it!,5
Great game but personally i believe this game is more suitable for tablets unless you want your phones battery to be sucked out like an energy vamp then be my guest. The story is awesome but every time theres a next episode you have to download x amount of data i.e. 5-20 megabytes of more data on some episodes not all. I will uninstall not because its a bad game this is an Icon of the video game industry which we all love Nintendo. I will uninstall cause i dont want to be charging my phones battery constantly and let (data) to be downloaded every time i need to proceed to the next chapter....Thank You.,2
"Pleasantly surprised by this game! The characters are charming, the music is great, and there are a lot of things to do. The ONLY reason this has been getting downvotes is because it's a ""Gatcha"" game. But you don't need to spend money to play the game or just enjoy the story. You can do all of that for free. 5/5 for me!",5
"Keeps getting stuck at the avenue to power tutorial. It won't even load. Had it sitting all night and it still wouldn't load. Please fix *FIXED* if you keep getting stuck on the co-op tutorial and you're using an Android, turn off your power saving mode. This fixes the problem immediately! I have a S9+",5
The story is okay. The game play and co-ops are fun! I spent some real on this only to catch up lol. THE MAIN SONG IS SO CUTE!,4
"Been enjoying the game a lot. I see a lot of people complaining about the controls, downloads and all that. For controls, you can do short swipe/drag instead of a long one which will help a lot with movement. For the ones that complains abt downloading every new quest, go to options and there's an option to download the full game so you won't be bothered by the notifications again. Honestly, it's a polished game, maybe a couple of issues with the co-op but they are working on it. The game just released and not even a month old, give it a break and just enjoy the game and content. Peace and god bless.",5
"Runs fine but for a gacha game the rates are god awful, expect to reroll for hours if you want to start off with a 5*",1
I love it. Hopefully it will be release in other countries.,5
"Grind, grind, grind. Fell into the same routine within about 6 hours play time. Plus the stamina bar is highly limiting. So it's a grind and pay to play game. Lose, lose.",3
"I really like it! It has a very unique style to it. You are always busy doing something and there are parts for all kinds of players. You can head straight for battle, spend time on upgrading your materials, or even read little stories to know the characters better! A multi-player option is also available. It's an easy to understand game. Just make sure you don't play too much!😊",5
"Sluggish, bloated. Needs to be faster, both in the menus and in game play. It takes me longer to just start up dragalia than it takes me to play a whole round of other mogabes.",2
The raid boss is so fun,5
"Crackly sound on multiple devices that sound fine normally, and NOTIFICATION SPAM WITHOUT ASKING FIRST.",1
Good game bruv,4
The AI of the team is trash u can only play one at a time can't dodge and auto attack on all of them..... yet they won't do that unless ur manual them I'm not even talking skills just auto and dodge.,1
"Great game with a decent story, feels like most mobile games till you get to the coop play which is really good. Haven't felt pressured to buy anything from the store at all also.",5
Clonky iffy controls and attacks. Pretty boring and monotone combat. Takes up waaaaaaaay to much space with forcing you to dl each new chapter. No way to just roll for champs dragons or just for wyrmprints making the rng way to frustrating and open.,3
love it,5
It's a great game with good graphics,5
"It's a great game. above and beyond on the cute voice acting and original soundtrack. yes, the story is generic, but it adds a sort of interest that a lot of other games with similar stories fail to achieve. It IS a gacha game, but the thing I love most about the system is that you can make a 1* character into a 5*! many games just let you forget about most of the trash pics you get from pulls, but if you like a character you can make them as strong as you want. I've been trying to find a good phone game that I can see myself playing for months to come and I think I've found it.",5
This game is good.,5
Amazing gameplay! I am so addicted I can't put it down. Best new game in a long time.,5
"Pretty cool, just needs some more heroes",5
Server issues have been fixed! I can finally play this fantastic game!,5
"Love it, surprised it's got a 3.5",5
"Great visuals, good music, generic story granted but still enjoyable. Virtually bug free and already filled with content",5
"The game runs really smoothly and there's a lot to do and collect. Plot is cliche and childish, but nostalgic. Gameplay is action dungeon crawler style, and you tap to attack and swipe to dodge telegraphs. The AI for your party is awful, and the summon rates are pretty low. Overall, still very polished and enjoyable!",5
Great game I definitely recommend,5
Amazing Game.,5
Dont like movement/combat it doesnt feel right at all. was excited until i saw played wish it had the movement pad instead out side of that its decent i guess,2
"Great but I'm stuck on this co-op option, connection is fine but cant progress further than that because it will not load",5
"Great game, characters and story so far. Lots of fun and very addicting. Kinda wish there was a way to customize the AI for your party members, kinda like... Be near the back, attack the same person that the player is attacking, only heal if player is under xx%... That kinda stuff. That being said, for being on its first week, not bad! Keep up the great work, Nintendo/Cygames!",5
Tis good,5
"I've never quite played a game of this caliber and I must say I am pleasantly impressed, it's just beyond words how well it's made a wonderful story unique characters with there own personalities. There is hardly many games anymore that reach this potential. I absolutely love the dragons and the ability to change into them genius well done I say well done!",5
Has been my favorite since it was released. Simple fun with great grafics. No fuss just game play with fun story line. Another hole in one for Nintendo.,5
"I enjoy this game immensely, but I have recently encountered an issue and I cannot participate in any co-op quests or raids. It clocks out after about 3 seconds and I cannot enter a co-op quest. I am not sure if I am the only with this problem, but it would be greatly appreciated if this could be resolved. I would gladly change my rating afterwards.",4
I would like this game but the 3d models are broken and show up black and this issue still hasn't been addressed maybe I'll change my mind when it is fixed but so far the game sucks.,1
"I don't mind spending lots of $$$ on games, and I love this genre, but the 5 star rates on this game are so bad that I know any $ spent will be a waste. Greed ruins this game :/",3
Game is good they give u currency to gamble for a dragon hero or powerprint. Spent 75.00 on it to see if i cpuld pull a 5 star hero but no Would be better if we can get some kind of currency wen we summon so that incase we didnt get the pull that we wanted we can buy it by saveing up the currency from pulling like some otger games,3
"I love the game and all but I bought a combo pack, the purchase went thrugh but the items dissapeared because my game crashed when I bought it",5
The controls could use a bit of improvement but still a great game,5
"I'm enjoying it so far, just finished chapter 1. Interesting story, good mix of game genres. The controls are off however.. I'll try to walk around the corner and the joystick will completely reset and turn me off into another direction. Edit: There's alot going on in this game, items and numbers I have no clue about, energies and currencies. I'm kinda getting annoyed.. Edit: Seriously still don't understand and your Adventurers Guide or whatever sucks.. E.g: Nowhere does it mention Facility level. Among several other things just forgotten to be explained.. Edit: Now I'm getting notifications purely in Japanese. No help from support. I'm uninstalling.",2
"Vivant play it. It takes too much storage and at the end 9o% it says lost connection, and starts over. You know what haplens, don't, I'll tell you it never stops.",2
If you make a mobile zelda i would loce for it to be like this but without the summoning,5
Boring,3
I loved the game but the characters were all black and it was weird pls fix it,4
Awesome game :),5
Worth playing,5
Didn't run well,2
Dragalia Lost is a completely different twist on games nothing out there like it. Keep up the good work love the updates,5
"I LOVED IT!!! THE VOICES,CHARACTERS AND STORY ARE AMMMMAZING!!!",5
"I LOVE THIS GAMES SOUBDTRACK , THIS IS A FUN GAME",5
Good game but a lot of dialog between action. And it loses some progress occasionally.,2
"Dragalia is amazing! The gameplay is fun, yes it is like other mobile games in structure, but I like the battle system...most games like this are turn based. Graphics are bright and crisp. I like characters and dragons combo (gatcha but it's not bad because there's hero/dragon/card all in one draw so there's not tons of different currencies). Easy upgrade system for powers/levels and weapons. There's even a small scale castle/resources building game built it which seems easy and low maintenance. I've had the game a week and put more hours into it than I do other games in a month. Good job Nintendo!",5
Great game but I'm stuck when it tries to make you create a room the first time for avenue of power in an endless loading screen,4
Extremely addicting game not a fan of phone games but absolute love this one,5
After every scene you have to download more. . .,1
"Every now and then, I can't play coop with other people. Now that the raids have come, 8 cannot progress. Please fix",3
"I played so many mobile games and most of them never really stood out. Yea they had amazing graphics, but they never had good gameplay or story. I literally skip most of it to get gems. THIS GAME HOWEVER THROWS THAT OUT THE WINDOW. With a reasonable summon rate and amazing ""beat em up"" gameplay paired with some of the best graphics available, this game is like a mini mmo at the palm of your hand. People that complain about pulls probably dont know how to reroll to get ahead start and just simply start it up without knowing. AND OH MY GOODNESS, THE SOUND TRACK IS TO DIE FOR. I literally bop to the music whenever I pull or fight a dragon. Cygames and Nintendo got a good game going on and I cant wait to see what they have in store in the future.",5
it's too much space,4
Can't download,1
I cant play it because the loading screen will just stay there I waited for 10 min and nothing happens,3
"The co-op won't let me connect. It loads for a while,doesnt connect and won't exit or let me interact with the game. I have to restart the game before I'm able to do anything. I've cleared my cache but that didnt do anything.",3
Its good,5
"Clunky controls, terrible gacha rates. Graphically it's beautiful but graphics alone certainly don't make anything worth playing, this included.",1
"Good game and I love it so far, but one thing that bothers me is the building limit in the Castle. Say I put away an Earth alter. It's gone for good and I can't reproduce more?? Please fix this. I personally think its dumb to have that in this game.",4
"The controls are a little tedious and the chibi models look nice but are odd, the over all aesthetic is beautuful and the gameplay is really good.",5
There seems to be a big issue with the Co-Op can't make rooms or join any. Fun otherwise but kinda lame I can't play with my friends,4
"So, the game looks great, but the controls are an absolute nightmare. Would be willing to go up to a 4* rating if they were fixed. Basically your movement is based on swiping, then holding your finger, but the direction is based off your initial contact with the screen and not relative to your character, so it's very clunky. Not to mention you can't see anything cause your finger is blocking the whole screen. Combat is also terrible, as the game auto targets the closest enemy, not the one you are tapping, so heroes are constantly changing targets and it's impossible to focus down one strong enemy. Also, the gacha is a huge case of blue balls, as there are three main things you need (heroes, dragons, and wyrmprints) but the are all combined into one gacha pool. Want the new 5* event hero? Well congrats, you got a 5* in your summon but it was a dragon you didn't need or want. Seriously, this is a perfect case of what could have been a great game but was killed by lazy devs.",2
"I don't like the gacha pull rate. I just want to get Adventurous and Dragons, not Wyrmprints(cards), the gacha system in this game is stupid, ridiculous, horrible and awful. The Adventurers and Dragons are more important to get in the gacha pull. And it is difficult to play this game by not getting the appropriate elemental Adventurers for the quest, like using Fire elemental Adventurers in a Wind elemental quest, cause Fire is strong against Wind. The battle system is bad and is not smooth either, it's hard to move the Adventurer I am controlling properly and my Adventurer always attacks in front of him/her when I tap the screen, the Adventurer doesn't attack where I am tapping on the screen. And why does this game gives the main character of the game a Wind elemental Dragon when the main character is a Fire elemental Adventurer, they are not compatible. For example, equipping a Fire elemental Dragon to a Fire elemental Adventurer can give a bonus boost to the Adventurer stats and grant abilities if the Dragon and the Adventurer are the same element. This game has serious flaws.",1
"Pros: -The music is awesome. I especially like the songs with vocals like the title screen, main menu, and the boss song. -The voice acting is good. They match the characters IMO. -The graphics are so bright and colorful. Makes me happy. Cons: -The freakin' controls. I already don't care for moving characters on a touch screen, and this game is not making things any better. I wish that I could somehow have physical buttons (Switch *hint hint*) -This is kinda a nitpick, but I find some of the characters generic when it comes to their personality. But this is a gacha game, so it's to be expected I guess.",4
It be good but it loads the just say failed to connect everytime,1
"I love everything about this game, except for the fact that I can't find any games for the event on co op. I know it's not my wifi cause nobody but me is on rn.",4
"This game has a nice soundtrack, simple to play, great artwork and well placed effects. Overall for a game similar those in it's field, this is probably my new favorite. I say give it a try.",5
Please fix the co op it won't let me join other people rooms but besides that's it's an amazing game,5
"great music, great graphics, but the battle controls could use some work. I am always facing the wrong directions every time. The hold attack works half of the time. Really frustrating.",4
Currently stuck at the event screen. Wont load into making a lobby.,4
My game got stuck in doing the co-op mandatory quest and just stays in limbo,1
can't even play the game,1
Best game I have played,5
"The game is great but the getherwing system is killing your playerbase right out of the gates. Please scrap this system, people need to be able to play multiplayer.",4
"Well made overall, but I personally hate the controls. Auto ignores boxes and items and manual is 1 finger, so moving and attacking get mixed occasionally. Play if you like it bc it should be well supported. Just not into it myself",2
"Good concept but finicky controls due to poor design and multiplayer issues, in a game designed around co-op. It falls flat at almpst everything its trying to be, but is solvable. Qustion is how long will it take before they fix it.",3
You run out of free currency to fast and the controls are ass. I play on an S9+ and the characters just spasm all over the place. Doing the charge attack doesn't register and you have to point in the opposite direction. Overall I see this game dying. Cygames you need to be more generous Princess Connect ReDive gave out crystals like it was candy. I won't settle for less.,1
Connection errors connection failures lots of lagg when I have a good stable internet pretty much unplayable for me on my sub $300 phone I guess it's just not cut out for this game.,1
Great game needs pvp and leaderboards,5
Amazing graphics. Great gacha aspects.,5
"White screen, app stopped working",2
"Game ramps up so quickly that the paywall smacks you by level 5. The cost of ingame items is extremely high for a mobile game. It also has to ASK you to download before every fight. My advice, avoid at all costs. Shame on Nintendo",1
"It's a good enough of a game, but it bogs itself down with its premium summoning mechanic. See, there are 2 kinda of currency. 1 is upgrade currency, the other is summoning currency. Receving upgrade currency is easy enough on it's own, but gathering summoning either a chore or expensive. There are 2 types of summoning currency, but they are both worth the same when it comes to summoning. One of them you earn, the other you buy. Either you spend the next few hours gathering enough for a 10x summon, or you spend $32 for a 10x summon. It's just not worth to keep playing.",3
Mhm,5
"Great game but for people who'd like to buy something from the store, well theres currently a bug that locks you out of the ability to purchase from it, you dont even need to biy something beforehand for it to start affecting you. But if your a fully F2P gamer then the games is right up your alley, havent gotten any problem other than this.",3
"It's a good game, but beware that it can get addicting.. hence you might spend a bit in this game. Then again, it is a gatcha game.",5
"Fixed one problem, but now it's impossible to open a group for the new raid",1
"Overall I love the game. It has a great story line and can play for hours, however I hate coop play. There never seems to be anyone playing coop and can never get endeavors with coop because of this. The game also continues to load and have to shut the game down completely when it can't find any rooms for coop. There should be a way to cancel coop without having to completely shut down the game. Please fix!!!",4
"Probably one of nintendo best games yet. The draw rates for characters are pretty good, so you're almost guaranteed a 5*, and the gameplay is smooth. I am having issues with trying to play coop but that's probably a problem with internet or phone, but coop sometimes works and it's really fun to play with friends. I've been playing this game for a couple of days now and just been hooked to the game and just stop playing. I would recommend this to anyone since it's always nice to start early and the game is still spmewhat incomplete. Story is also nice",5
It's lots of fun and all the characters have their personality,5
i am impressed. good story line. awesome graphics. anima is very well done. bright colorful and lively. all together well put together game. thanks Nintendo 😋😋😋 it will be a pleasure to continue seeing what this game unfolds!,5
Not terrible,5
Every time I try to launch the game my entire screen freezes. The only time I can get in to play is when there's an update within the same play session.,1
Stuck in coop tutorial. Can't play beyond make a room. Game just hangs when you click to make a room. Using a galaxy note 5 with solid internet connection.,2
"Gacha rates are awful. Saved all my wyrmite for this first banner. Did 5 10x summons and only got a single 5* wyrmprint. The other 4 were 90%-100% 3* trash. Would not recommend. Stay away, save your time and money. Play something else.",1
Its pretty good with friends,5
"The CO-OP is seriously broken it just searchers and I can't cancel unless I close the app and restart, I lile the game but taking a big feature away from it such as co-op I tend not to play. Just collect and go",4
There is a glaring issue with using Wifi and trying to play the game. I cannot log into the game from the main menu as it says that it failed to connect. Wifi works perfectly fine on other games and browsing the internet.,4
I dont know why some of bad review's because I actually like this game it fun and fair like most game where there p2w i have gotten 6+ 10 summons matter of 4 days because fairness actually spent little $7 on it i never spend money on games cause most are so p2w you have to spend $100s every other week to keep up which most games dont understand you can promote your stuff but makeing unbalance will eventually kill your game ill probly spend little here and there every now then just to balance because it is fun with lot of story and adventure which most game forget about ill say nintento and cygames did a great job this time you have to grind little but not to bad. FOR DEVELOPERS IF YOU READ THIS CO-OP WORKS ONLY WIFI tried on cell doesn't work ty for game,5
So far I like the game but I'm stuck on the forced tutorial for co-op to create a room. Have tried for several days now and it just sits there. Will change rating when I can get past this part.,3
"For the record, Nintendo didn't really make this game, they just slapped their name on it. It's actually made by a company called CyGames, creators of Rage of Bahamut. The game brings a lot to the table in the mobage market, including town building and an ARPG aspect (which admittedly already existed in smaller projects which were killed), but also suffers from having a lot of designs stolen from an earlier CyGames project, Knights of Glory, and from godawful rates. The story is also laughably bad and has the typical Nintendo localization, i.e garbage",3
"I take my word back this games was my second games with worst gacha rate, who idea put three thing inone gacha is already bad.",2
"I think this is legitimately a good gacha game, but there's one huge flaw for me personally... I can't spend money. Any time I try to purchase something, the game informs me that I have a transaction that needs to be completed, but then I can't actually complete the transaction since the button doesn't work. I'm trying to throw my money as this game and it won't let me, never before has a gacha forced me to he f2p, and no sir, I don't like it. Fix it, and my score would go up at least to four stars.",3
"Really fun, grind heavy. P2W as all gachas are but you can still be a menace without paying",5
I can't connect to server is it because I'm a guest or something,1
My linked game freezes when I try to create a room for the Avenue of power event :(,4
"pretty good, except most of the time i cant connect to or go to co-op rooms... as in it never loads which is infuriating (samsung galaxy s8+ model btw...)",4
Brilliantly awesome in depth customization. Comics.. Story.. Art styles.. Missing guild and chat! I'll see where this goes!,5
"Great story, characters, music and visuals. Some of the art is downright amazing. Each character gets their own story and you even get a little bit of town building. Co-op is solid. Overall a fantastic game.",5
"Fun game, controls can still use some work, but the game is still so I expect it to get better",5
Well it is good but I did one spawn and it kicked me out of the the app and took my wyverniem,5
"This is hands down one of the best games I think has ever been on the app store. It combines the gameplay of fighting through dungeons as heroes with empire building and throws 4 player co-op into the mix. THE ONLY PROBLEM I have with this game would be its controls. The movement of tapping-and-holding has this feature where if you just barely move it to the sides while holding to move your character, you will start moving in a completely different direction. It makes it very difficult to complete timed quests and ruins the ebb and flow of combat, turning your character mid combo or stopping you from attempting a strong attack. Even with the wonky controls, I applaud Nintendo for making such an amazing game -- and that it's on mobile, too!",4
Yuh,5
"The fact that I had to wait to download the game, launch the game, just to download the game again is absurd. And that was only the prologue. After you play the prologue you have to download again. Tried to do the first actual mission and you have to download it! Why did it take so long to download if it didn't download all the missions? And yes, I know you can do a batch download now but why wasn't that a choice to choose when downloading it at first? As for the gameplay itself, it does give enough rewards to make it feel that you don't need to spend money but which games doesn't? As of right now, I don't think too highly of it but I will keep going to see if it gets better.",2
"It's a gacha game, with all that entails. But each character has their own story, and the gameplay is easy but not mindless. Portrait is a plus!",5
"I really enjoy the came, I just wish that the Co-op feature would work. So I could interact and play with other players to beat hard quests.",4
"I have no complaints, this game has good story, co-op, and gameplay totally recommend this game 100%.",5
"A fantastic story, great progression so it's not too easy but if you go for it you can achieve anything you put your mind to. Definitely not pay-to-win, which is very nice. Characters are a bit generic, but that's to be expected with a mobile game. Won't put this one down for a long time.",5
Great game,5
Very f2p friendly so far,5
Es genial!,5
love it so far. but it wont load when it first prompts you to go do co-op mission. would hope to continue playing soon. thank you!,4
Love the game so far,5
Just like Nintendo console,5
I summoned a Joanne of arc but she's not in my character list. Is there a bug?,5
The most addictive game ever!!!!,5
Great gameplay! It's one of the most fun games I've ever played,5
"Great art style. Great presentation. Plenty of activities. A lot you can do prior to spending money. (in-game currency is pricey, though) Voice-acting is decent to good. Dialogue is well written. Controls are the only weakpoint. The game chooses your attack targets, and it may not attack what you want. (tapping on an enemy doesn't make it your target.) Charging a force attack may require several tries. Remember to adjust sensitivity!",4
"For anyone about to start playing this game know that it is gacha based. You won't have to spend money in order to roll as the game seems to be generous with the amount of gems in gives. Also know that you don't need the 5* units as it seems the game allows units to evolve to the highest rarity. Anyway, I don't mind gacha games. That's the type of mobile game I usually play, however when the gacha has more than just units in it (or adventurers as this game calls it) it's a problem for me because it's difficult to get the units. If they ever remove those dragons and wymprints (just put them in a separate gacha) I'll come back as the gameplay is good and I like the fact that it has the option to choose the Japanese voice with English text.",3
"Game is good,but the controls is what killed it for me.",3
Legend of the dragoon clone love it,5
Really good game!!! Love the concept and storyline! Characters are really cute!,5
Dragalia lost takes the best features of the best open-world rpg mobile games and does them better. Highly recommend it to anyone that wants a great game on their phone.,5
Download this to download some later to download each level to download more info to download the allies. I only got to the first level after the tutorial and I was 4 downloads in and over 1.5GB extra data.,1
It's a decent game,5
"Magnificent sound design, great visuals, and interesting characters are about the only highlights of this game. Overwhelming menus, currencies, and gacha elements keep this gem from reaching its maximum potential.",3
The title screen is top notch. 10/10,5
I like it but it takes to long to load,4
"Really fun ,and not very much pay yo win which is the best part",5
"Annoying presentation of cut scenes, constant loading screens, and pay to win gacha? No thanks. The graphics are great however.",2
"It's like every other mobile gacha game. It's not bad, but I'm not overly impressed. Being this is from Nintendo, I just expected more. Theres nothing that really sets this apart from any other similar game. I'm also not a big fan of the constant small updates for every level and side mission. Loading between areas also takes longer than expected. Disrupts the flow of the game. I fell like I'm waiting to do things more than anything.",3
"The graphics and gameplay are pretty cool. However, the bugs are kind of ridiculous. Every new app usually has a few bugs, but these are major, especially for such a big company. The whole co-op bug makes it to where you can't play at all (and can't do anything about it). Fix it, and it'll be a great game. Until then, the game sucks bc people, literally, cannot play it.",2
"If you're a fan of grinding anime gacha games, this is for you. Produced alongside Cygames, creator of the Japanese hit ""Granblue Fantasy"", most progression systems are familiar and have been translated well. Also includes a small city builder component.",5
"This is a simple gatcha style game with a ton of story, style, and character. Those looking for an interesting world to dive into have no further to look",5
"I'm honestly surprised the rating for this game is so low. Been playing since launch and I've enjoyed the hell out of it so far. The game slows down about midway through, but this is mitigated by playing smarter and doing all your dailies. I'm sitting on about 9000 wyrmite and I haven't spent anything yet, I've mostly just been focused on leveling up the few heroes I already have",5
"Super cool action RPG! Nintendo, you really spent your time to make a quality mobile game! Thanks!",5
Great game so far. Did roll a 5 star 1st time. Not needed but helps a bit. Viable 3 and 4 star characters. Art style amazing!!!,4
"Very high quality rpg with standard mobile gacha trimmings. Fairly generous by those standards though. Be sure to go in options and choose the option to download all content, otherwise you have to have small downloads before some quests.",5
fix co-op bug by turning off power saving mode,5
"Good combat, the mechanics seem solid. An excellent gacha game with lots of potential!",5
Ok so i love the game and want it to be amazing because it really has so many unique ideas. However this game lost two stars because im at a point where i cant do anything. I go and do the event but the game just wont load and it forces me to do the event. If this gets fixed thisll be an easy five stars. Till then its the latter,3
Really good game but the controls are kinda weird,5
"Nintendo knocked this one out of the park. The game is fun, has lots to do, isn't overly complicated, and the gacha is fairly priced. My only small gripe is that on auto the AI is a bit dumb, but why bother playing if you don't want to play, right? This is what mobile gaming should look like.",5
It's cool,5
Fun game cute graphics great music it's got the Nintendo seal of quality! the only thing that bothers me is the small amount of wyrmite's at endgame and all quest endeavors should reset weekly to offset this minor nuisance,5
"Great game in general, but takes up a lot of space.",4
That's hot! Oh and the game is too!!!! lol. no really play this one,5
"This game was amazing and I played it so much throughout the first day but as soon as I got to a tutorial for co-op, it loads and no matter how strong internet im in, it never loads, so I cant play the game at all right now because I cant skip tutorials.",2
"A lot of fun! Easy to learn, but plenty of depth to stay interesting.",5
Love this game cant keep myself from playing it it's so fun,5
Game keeps crashing and won't let me connect to the server so I can't play it.,2
This game is a memory hog it takes to much memory my tablet only has 2 gig this game takes 1.25 gig.:-(,2
"The story is great, characters are wonderful but the control is awful and the game is very stingy, it's difficult to get new characters and wyrmprints and dragons, stamina recovers 1 per 6 min, wings recover 1 per hours is rediculous, takes 1 hr to get enough stamina to run 1 quest",2
"This game literally will not work on my wifi network. Kept saying cannot connect to server, I turn wifi off and it let me link my Nintendo account and accept privacy terms. It then asked me to download a friggin 1 gig patch, I tried to reconnect to my wifi and it disconnected me from their server. Garbage. Complete garbage.",1
"Basically what you'd expect from a summoning-based rpg game, nothing too special. The battle animations are very satisfying to watch. The main plot is not that great, but a highlight is that each character has great background stories!",4
Great story but controls could have been better design,4
"The battle system is very boring. The music is AMAZING!!! But I feel it's wasted on this game. Players are going to get bored if how simple it is sooner than later. I still recommend trying the game to others, but it feels too much like alchemist code with how you not only need to roll for players but items and powers as well. It becomes repetitive VERY quickly and has no actual fun factor outside of battling to the amazing soundtrack. The design is veeeery nice, but the main character is insanely generic and too commonly seen in soooooo many animes to be interesting at all. I think I'll quit this and stick with fire emblem heroes. Fun in a game comes from having something to work towards and this one truly feels lacking in both that and a fun battle system.",5
"This game has a ton of content and fun. Summon rate is horrible, but if you can just play the game with whatever you got. You'll get draw into the story and find this game very enjoyable.",5
"The game is amazing, just having trouble purchasing anything and I'm not getting a response back. Other then that it's a fun and unique game.",5
Fun game but it's so damn annoying when the game consistently freezes as I try to create a co-op room. Fix that please.,3
Great music & story for free mobile game,5
"Another money grab game. I do like how rare drops really are rare, but to do a 10 summon it should not cost that much. Its equivalent to 17 dollars I believe. The game itself is a smash up between all the popular games. There is a lot of potential but hackers already have all the great stuff so if multiplayer comes out that game will die instantly",1
Greatest mobile game ever. It's super generous about everything and you don't need money to play it.,5
"The game is your average gacha game, nothing new really. The gameplay however is not my cup of tea. Why is there a delay between inputs. The delay feels about 0.5 seconds long, and makes the game feel very clunky. In these types of live action rpgs, gameplay is 90% of the game. When you give a player/customer gameplay/controls that they know can be better, you're basically giving them 10% of a game. That, I can not approve of.",2
"The game is good, I like the story, but I'm not a huge fan of the controls. Also the Co-op part of the seems buggy, as I can't get it to load; even to pass the tutorial on how it works.",4
"Wow. Probably the most fun I've had with a gacha since DBZ Dokkan Battle. The voice acting, story, and art are all excellent. To those stating that the F2P is lacking, I advise that you play more co-op. For each new co-op player on your team, you earn premium currency. At best, you can earn one new pull for every 10 plays.",5
Perfect. Perfect.,5
Gets challenging which keeps it exciting. Fun characters and generous rewards.,5
"Really enjoying the gameplay. It's simple action rpg but with deep stat management. The story is fine but the presentation is great. It's got the same ""gatcha"" mechanics as every asian phone game in existence but it's still fun. I recommend doing the ""batch download"" in the options once you can get to it. What I don't understand is why all these people are giving it low scores hours after it came out the 1st day. I mean come on guys. The hating has got to stop. You cant even really experience much in this game in that short amount of time and you are already trying to review it. I've spent a week with it and thoroughly enjoy it. It's not perfect but its definitely better than most of these other phone games and deserves a way higher score than a 3.5 by Play store standards.",4
Fun game was really enjoying it until i got to ch.2/2-2 and the tutorial forced me to go Avenue to power: Beginner then co-op then create a room and after all that it just loads forever and i cant play it no way to get out of it except to uninstall and reinstall and then you just hit the same problem again. Fix this please and ill give it five stars!!!!,1
I love this game thank u very much,5
"There's a lot to offer in Dragalia Lost. If youre looking for a real time combat, story driven action RPG with great visuals and voice acting this is unmatched on mobile. There's a ton of content and worth the price of storage and data.",5
"Starts off good but then takes a stupid turn. Your offline partners just stand in the line of fire as if there is no indication of a AOE or direct attack is coming there way. It forces you to use your Wings for CO-OP play and like most gotcha games is trying to reel in Whales for profits. If you don't want to pay to win after you beat the story mode, which can be done in a day, don't bother with this game. Easy way to fix it, make the adventurers smarter, and give back the bonus 150 wyverm gems for teaming up with someone new. Until those two are added I don't recommend this game.",2
What a well put together game don't listen to the negative reviews,5
Soooooo,5
1.21 gig download after the initial 50 meg download from Google play? Nah,1
"Should've been a turn based game by the design, imo. The controls suck ass so gameplay is lacking a lot. Needs a auto play feature but I most likely havent unlocked it. The gacha rates arent that great either but coming from Brave Frontier I aint bitching about that too much LOL. I can see why its got bad reviews tho and it just launched. Like most people I'm disappointed with Nintendo. They usually have great content and storylines so I was looking forward to this. Also one last thing, constantly downloading data is lame!!!! I'd rather do one big download than a bunch of little ones. Like every mini story is a data download. LOL. I guess I'll stick to Honkai Impact for now. I feel like this is a pay to win and Nintendo will attempt to suck its players dry and kill the game off somehow. Esp with how negative people are reacting to it. PS just found out you can do a full download in system settings. you unlock auto play after ch1-4. however it is not a full auto feature. only does simple movements and basic attacks. does not collect hidden loot.",3
"Really great game co-op still unstable for me though, always freezes up and have to restart hope they fix that issue, other then that its a really deep and beautiful game!",4
A very well made gacha game. The story is actually good. Plays well on my Samsung Galaxy S8 with no hiccups. I'm very happy with this game and actually want to invest time into this game unlike many other phone games.,5
Nice game !!!,5
"Really fun and addicting. Would love to play this on the Switch too. Hoping it comes out for it in the future, and it would be cool if we were able to sync the data with a Nintendo account.",5
IF YOU DONT WANT TO DOWNLOAD EACH MISSION JUST GO INTO OPTIONS AND DOWNLOAD EVERYTHING IN A BATCH,5
"It's a very fun game, but it keeps crashing at the co-op quest walkthrough. Also logging back in doesn't help because it will automatically go back into the walkthrough.",3
Needs better controls,3
"I've waited for this beautiful game for so long, and it was worth the wait. This game is a masterpiece, by far the best game I've ever played on the app store, and better than all others. I can't stop playing, and thank you for this game",5
Good stuff,5
Good game but some times slow. Had a problem when battling the golom boss it teleported me and my team to a different boss arena without no boss hopefully you can fix.,5
It's a great game. Just the controls are a bit clunky and gacha rates are trash.,5
"Awesome ARPG with a really good soundtrack Oh, get ready for that song that plays over n over when downloading data it's catchy, now it's stuck in my head. Love It Man!",5
"4.5/5  Extremely well executed for a mobile game, and a brand new series no less. The artwork, both 2D and 3D, are top notch. The Characters and story are generally lighthearted and not too self-serious, while still having enough gravity and potential for development to be interesting. The combat is quite smooth, although it can be difficult to control on a small screen with only touch controls.  I hope it does well and would interested to see a sequel on a proper Nintendo console at some point.",5
"Dragalia was a pretty hyped up game. People said it would destroy mobile profiteering, not indulge in it. Bring balance to monetization, not leave it an exploitative cesspool. You were my childhood, Nintendo. I used to love your games. But now, by your poor gacha rates, arbitrary stamina restrictions, time gated town building, senseless grinding and endless microtransactions combined, you've become Captain Cash Grab. Go Nintendo! Just go.",1
"This game is awesome. I'm obsessed. It's a gacha, but the summon rates aren't horrible like other games. It's a card collector, a dragon collector, a city builder, an action rpg with great combat. There's so many things to do. It's another amazing title from Nintendo.",5
Good game,4
"I think this is a great game. No issues so far and I've been looking forward to the next time I get to pick it up and play which is not often my stance with phone games. Either way, I'm enjoying it and the story very much. Maybe if we're lucky we'll see a more fleshed out game in the same world on the switch or ds.",5
"By far my favorite gacha. Summon rates ar brutal, so don't be afraid to reroll til you get something you want to invest in. One good char will carry you a long way.",5
Issues fixed. Game is lots of fun.,5
Chapter 3 crash,2
"This game is great, has an amazing story, and catches you with the RNG. The actual gameplay is fun and isn't as repetitive as other similar style games. Although this is a gatcha style game, it isn't hard to earn currency in game for summons, so you don't need to purchase at all. Overall, this game is amazing and would recommend to give a shot",5
"This game requires over a gigabyte of additional data download before any gameplay is accessible. Literally nothing can be done until this additional download is completed. It is not able to be paused and resumed later. At this time, this additional requirement is not posted in the app's description or download size field.",2
Great game with an original story. Free to play friendly.,5
"Excellent narrative, though the english localization takes some creative decisions that ruins the verosimilitude of the epic fantasy background from time to time. Graphics are pretty nice and there is eye candy all over the place. I find this crucial for the collection part of the game. What truly shines is the gameplay. The first 10 to 15 hours you will likely see it as a walk in the park but later you will need to start predicting bosses moves and the scene is going to seem that you are playing a bullet hell instead of an ARPG. Traps, bolts, enemy AoE, all at the same time. Plus, you will need to add diversity to your team and think of the vulnerabilities of your enemies. All this, make it feel challenging and keeps me trying to learn my characters and try out different teams, speaking of which there are several different types of gameplay styles depending on the character and its weapon. Overall, I really liked that it didn't came across as one of those F2P players forbidden gacha games as you can enjoy the story and gameplay without paying and running through the 6 chapters the game has to offer until now prett much with 3 star characters.",5
"Alot of people seem to be complaining, but this game has been an absolute blast and a joy to play with my husband. It's really fun to see all of the characters available and all the amaizing dragon designs. The story is great, and even though this game is a gacha game it plays really nice since you will more than likely end up being able to perform a 10 fold summon a day if you try hard enough. I highly reccomend this if you have friends who also love RPGs and want to have something to play with them in your down time.",5
This game is way better than 3 and a half stars. Plus the soundtrack is fire.,5
Amazeballs.... But please Nintendo....STOP RELEASING GAMES IN 16:9 ASPECT RATIOS ONLY. Every game your company released does.not support 18:9 aspect ratios which has been standard on flagship phones for years now. Every game you release this happens. Please update the game so I'm not staring at navigation and status bars.,5
Fun and addictive.,5
The rabbit girl has my favorite figure. Too bad she's not a playable character. Maybe in future updates. Quit baby raging 1★ reviews!,5
"I really like the story. The single player is fun and multiplayer is implemented really well. There may be a few too many currencies in the game with rupees, wyrm-something, Mana, diamonds, and the stuff used to promote heroes. Lots to do every day and I usually level up before I run out of stamina, overflowing my gauge, making it easy to stay engaged in the game.",5
"I would say i really enjoy this game if i were actually able to get past an inescapable part of the game where i am supposed to create a co-op room, the problem is that it continuously loads and nothing happens(i did this fo an hour). I would like it if nintendo could get back to me on this subject",2
Controls atm are alittle rough and summon rates are low (but aint they always) but if u like a game with a story then u need to pick this up this game has the best story mixed with character/dragon stories for a gacha i have ever seen,5
"It's super fun and addictive, but the 5 star rate for summoning is too low, and it's an enough amount of pain to even get enough of Wyrmite to do a tenfold summon.",4
"I absolutely love this game! Right away when I saw some of the gameplay, I had to pre register! I love this game too bits and its the only game I can say that I'd rather play this than watch youtube. I would like for you guys to add a chat system if you can, and I wish I could've watched the movie segment but my phone couldn't handle it and it kept freezing.. But nevertheless, five stars from me! Its only recently come out and I love. Cant wait for the future of this game!",5
"Everything is great but the controls are wonky, i love the auto move option cus I can still control my character while I'm in it",5
"This game could get more than three stars if a few things changed. For one, moving is horrible, by far one of the worst i've played when it comes to moving the lead character. I would sooner tap on the screen to get to a location rather than fight to get my character in the direction I want it to....it is that bad.  Next, is the wait time, the lag. To start a new mission you have huge periods where you are waiting...like it's loading up or something. If you want fast paced action, without lag...this game will only frustrate you. It doesn't matter the speed of your device or what setting you have it on. I have a fast tablet, and have tried this on all possible settings only to wait and wait and wait for the game to load.  Last complaint, the music....it is driving me nuts. There is only a few sound tracks to this game and each piece is so short it loops over and over( Just like when you waited for this game to download...over and over the same song.)  Now, on the flip side, it has a decent story and the graphics is very nice. The game offers enough goodies to play without spending your whole paycheck on it. The controls have got to go though!!!",3
Can't even download keeps repeating the download process would like to see this fixed because it looks like a good game,1
"Fun gameplay, decent story entertaining, that's good enough for me. 👍",5
Very good job!,5
"Great in many ways, I am f2p and the game has just the right difficulty for me. Totally recommend it. The only major problem I have with it is that you need to download data every time you play so it cant be played offline at all",5
"Love everything this game has to offer. Great story, fun and simple gameplay for (for young adults) and overall lots of rewards to collect. Great gacha game! :3",5
"Great game, I'm having a lot of fun! Gacha takes nothing away from the experience and I've had no issues with the 3d models.",5
Its aite,5
needs controller support,2
"Great game, but I've run into a bug where the tutorial for co-op just keeps loading and won't actually load",4
How can the developers skim over purchasing issues.....unacceptable,1
Gud,5
"My old phone cant handle this game and freezes lemme leave a 1 star review on a game that is much better than 1 star. Jeez, this is why we cant have nice things. This games great though.",5
The Nintendo account won't not open that why I put this game in star 1,1
"Same old F2P gotcha system, but man.. the production value is through the roof.",5
Cannot start a room for multiplayer. It is a requirement for the campaign and so all forward progress is halted.,2
Really fun game but still need some improvement on AI auto battle and control sensitivity. Overall fun game but sadly no pvp. The game engages you to play with others.,5
"I tried this game out for a few hours (Played through chapter 2) and I tried to like it, but in the end it's just not very fun IMO. All the gameplay is split up into 1-2 min parts followed by long text based story reads by characters still arts, and very few cut scenes, and NO Anime cut scenes at all. It was big disapointment for me all around sadly.",3
"One of the most fun games I've played on mobile. Nice story and no problems with co-op or gacha, very good game and would recommend.",5
"Fun little co-op ARPG, get in and get out. Fun boss fights, I cant wait to see what raids are like. Some things I'd like to see are guilds and maybe sharing something in the castle grounds that benefits friends, similar to Pocket Camps Gardens.",5
This game looks good but the controls suck. Charge attacks never work. I cant tell what im pressing on and every map and quest has an extra download. No thanks.,1
This game is amazing play now,5
Love it,5
"Awesome game and awesome gameplay, if you like bleach brave souls you'll love this. Same concept",5
Cool game but really annoyed that everything isnt downloaded when I installed the game.,3
I would rate this game 5 stars but the makers know there is a glitch for the co-op tutorial that is stopping people from playing and they would rather focus on putting out new events than help everyone play the game properly,1
"Just perfect, but I found some bugs, there's purple glitch on loading scene and some on the menu .. Xiaomi redmi note2",5
The game runs very well. There are quality settings for any phone. Plus the game presentation is very well made.,5
"Its good but when creating a room it takes too long to load, so fix it pls",4
Well it's great until it forces you to co-OP and just sits there after clicking make a room. Can't move on serious bug to have at launch.,1
Overall it's nothing more than a boring mediocre game. I will admit to the fact that it has some great ost and that's about it. I'd sooner download this games music than this game again.,2
Lots of fun!,5
It's a good game. But I'm stuck at the co op create a room tutorial and cant progess.,3
This game is really fun. I love it!!! Thanks Nintendo!!!,5
"Don't listen to lower star reviews. The game itself is great for a gacha game...The dragon system is nice and the kingdom building is a nice side project along with all of the other missions you get to do. They are pretty generous with free currency to start which is more than enough to get a solid team build up. If it's anything like fire emblem with currency they basically throw it at you after awhile as well. It's grindy but at the same time fun. Graphics are amazing, story is decently generic, and the controls are okay but could use some fine tuning. All in all if you want something a little different than the run of the mill gacha with a great two companies at the back end, try this out.",5
This is a great game to pass the time. Really enjoyable,5
"I love this game, I haven't experienced any issues with bugs but I've heard some ppl have, regardless, The game is so much fun! You don't have to spend money if you don't want to for progression the game. I'm leveling up my characters, weapons, dragons, and cards, at a really fast rate, you just have to remember to do everything of the game has to offer to get all the materials and items you need. I play for at least 30 or 2hours at most every day and I've never hit a pay wall. Don't be discouraged by the low reviews, the bugs that exist if you do run into any will get fixed. I'm on a pixel 2 XL no bugs or issues for me at all, no problems downloading the optional data, and no problems with the coop.",5
i like the game but i can't get pass the create room process which idky i can't just skip it instead of being forced to go through even though i'll probably not do,3
Will not download the additional files to my Razer Phone. Both WiFi and cellular data eventually crash the data transfer and it prompts me to return to title screen or try again,2
Has alot of different aspect that are all very user friendly and in no way pay to win very hard to find games like this nowadays.,5
"The best mobile game I've played in ages! Amazing graphics, story, and characters.",5
'NINTENDO' JUST BLEW US AWAY!,5
"Really great game to pass the time and the voice acting is superb. The gacha aspect is a little silly but every character has their own story so you can know them on a deeper level. You also can shapshift into dragons and they have their own stories, it is a very fun game worth giving a try. The controls are a little wonky but the story and combat are very fluid.",4
"This game is great I am loving it, A lot of people are saying you need to pay a lot of cash to get stuff but its wrong you can get a lot of weapons dragons and playable characters by playing and getting the items to summon them. well I am enjoying it so far, why only 4star is because need more events and characters maybe change it to 5 stars soon. I also would love to have a auto move no both like a auto move button and a auto attack, if you click both it dose what it dose now but split them would be nice.",4
"Great gacha game, looking forward for later content!",5
"Great Game, with great gameplay and kinda good story. but thou the gacha system is too mean.... there's an option to grind normal star to 5* but still... it's takes morr effort than FEH....",5
"The game is great! It has it's flaws, but it's a good game with a good story, but the gacha rates are pretty bad. However patience will get you far and I like the grind so I don't mind it.",4
"by far this is the best mobile gacha game i've ever played. The graphics, the art, THE MUSIC ( DAOKO <3) and the gameplay are really good. The gacha rates are pretty low however i don't really care about it since i can grind the currency pretty easily and i've played something with lower drop rate ( FGO ). Overall is a fun game but sometimes the control pretty annoying but it grows on me. Better start playing now since there are a lot of stuff that you can get and there will be upcoming raid event for everyone.",5
"It forces you to do things in the beginning and because the game wont let me create a room for coop play I cant play the game, that needs to be fixed!",2
Cool game,5
"Good game, terrible, terrible controls.",3
Its wonderful when I can play. Currently there's a glitch or problem where we can't get past the tutorial for co-op mode. You cant skip or otherwise trick it so I'm 100% stuck til the devs fix it. Once fixed this will be a 5 star game,1
"I really like the game, but there is an extremely long, endless load screen for the co-op tutorial. I even had it load overnight and out was still loading by the time I woke up. There's no choice to opt out after I close the app. Please fix this problem",4
Graphics is awesome,5
Can be a bit bugy at times but I still love this game. People are complaining about the gacha rates but literally they give you free heros. Gacha is just a add on to the game like the castle. I will definitely keep this app for a while.,5
"Ch 2-2 Avenue to Power: Beginner Co-op play has bug. CO-OP play does not load. Please fix. Otherwise, good game!",3
"Silly, Dating Simulator Game, Realistic, Submit.",5
"I've been playing this since it came out, and I really enjoy the mix of base building, rpg and other mechanics. The gacha system hasn't been an issue for me as there have been plenty of ways to earn in game currency to get x10 summons and free main characters awarded at a regular basis. The story has been great and I love the side stories you pick up for your companions as you raise their stats via the mana circles.",5
Awesome game. Very generous compared to most Gachas. Very very good game.,5
"This mobile game is absolutely stunning! I am in love with the game play, the story line, even side stories you unlock from upgrading characters, or leveling up dragon affection. The music is the icing on the cake. The music is so beautiful and fitting. Everything has been put together very well for this game to come out great.",5
"1.25 jigabytes??? The only thing that generates that much storage use is a good game! Unfortunately you never know when or where one will show up. (Never really on mobile though.) The game is...fine. The controls are not good. I'm also apparently too old for this stuff now, because I dislike the art and music a lot...but they're done well. If you're younger it's probably good.",2
great game,5
The game itself is fine but I've been getting an error preventing me from purchasing ingame currency. Aside from the basic stuff they've been telling people there's been almost no help in trying to resolve the error.,2
Seriously need to fix the co-op issue. Overall it's a fun game and I was enjoying it up until it forces co-op but I never get past the loading. Please fix it asap.,2
"Besides a couple bugs here and there (the game was just released so it should be expected). It's great, I don't think I've ever spent so much time on mobile game and the amount of lore and thought that went into this game. It makes it a 5/5 for me",5
After many hours of reroll I finally got an account to start. Only to buy the starter pack and get a dupe. Legit tilted me so hard that I can't bear to look at this game anymore,1
nintendo apps start at 1 star for me and will edit if necessary,1
"I pass all the week playing, after your out of weterwings or whatever it calls you can't play if you dont pay, they just try to get you at first week, then you have to pay, or wait every 6 hours to refill the thing, to keep playing. The way you move in the game is super hard, and you can't walk and attack some times. The game it's ok in other things of a rpg game.",2
"I LOVE THE CONTROLS!!! So simple, I can play with one hand but, still full of action!! I also love the story and happy upbeat songs and the cute characters bobbing their heads to the beat! The 3d character designs and combos give me Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Rings of Fates nostalgia feels mixed with Brave Frontier and I love it. AND THE FREE COMICS!!! There's just SO MUCH CONTENT for a FREE game it's nearly unbelievable!!! Honestly speaking, the concepts never really stuck with me till my 3rd day of use. I'm so glad I stuck with this. Also, I summoned two 5☆ characters on two different accounts out of 5. On the rest, I got quite a few rare 5☆ summons. Everyone that complains the gacha rates are ""too low"" clearly never touched a gacha game a day in their lives. These rates are definitely better than most, if not, all of them.",5
"I play a lot of mobile gacha games and just the amount of launch content this one has is impressive. The music and character personalities are especially nice and a lot of the systems seem rather robust for a launch title. However, the game controls less than adequately as the game can't seem to handle diagonals or fast 180 movements very well. The game also currently lacks social functions like a chat or guild system.",4
"Trash can't get past chapter 3 like, have a game ready before release. can't make a room for the tutorial that's mandatory.like get your train wreck together nintendo.",1
I can't get past the tutorial co-op fix it plz it's annoying,2
Fun Game... Epic Dragons,5
I cant get pass the tutorial for co op it wont load,4
Great game.,5
Best Mobile game Nintendo has come out with keep it up,5
"Honestly don't understand how this is free to play with how well made is. The music is incredible, every character is viable but higher grade ones give the edgen. Overall I'm in love with this game.",5
I've been stuck on the tutorial for event quests. Screen just stays loading and no changes. Hopefully an update fixes these bugs. Really like the game though.,3
"Well made game, nice to see Nintendo trying new mobile games.",4
gureito,5
"I got stuck on the Avenue to power -> create the room. The fairy shadow keep moving for half an hour without any progress. I tried Wifi, internet and everything but couldn't pass through the tutorial. My phone is S8 plus T mobile.",1
Absolutely love it!,5
"Gameplay is fun, controls are lacking and frustrating at times. Co-op aspect is blocked behind a loading issue, unable to complete daily challanges.",2
Awesome,5
"Amazing. Everything about it is amazing. The controls should be optimized but other than that, it's great.",5
"Simple to get straight in and play, loved every bit of it got hooked on the summonings, the side story of the characters and dragons can't wait for future updates",5
The game is pretty good. They even allow you to change the vocals to japanese which is the icing on the cake for me,5
It's a great fun game I really dont know what everyone is complaining about just a bunch of big babies crying at this point,5
"One of the best games I've played on mobile. Easy gameplay, fair drops. All around good game",5
"The combat is pretty simple at the start, I hope it gets a bit more challenging later on. So far it is very generous with the summoning currency. This has to be the most polished mobile gacha game I've played. The music is so jolly, and catchy. It does seem a bit of a graphically demanding game, so some older mobile devices might stutter in certain points of the gameplay. I am looking forward to possible crossovers from both companies involved, and sinking into its fun co-op modes.",5
"Its ok. Its got great grapgics, i like the concept and its a very good story to follow. My issues are the walking controls are kind of iffy but not bad, i cant seem to find where to set a character for others to use, some things are not completely clear sometimes that only come up in the loading screen hints sometimes which should have come up as a menue interface tutorial instead. Things will come up as small tutorials as the story progresses rather than at the beginning. Overall 3.5 out of 5 as i just could not get into it. Thats a biased opinion though",3
I love it :),5
A fun game. Just play it and make up your own mind. It's FREE!,5
I like the game alot though they do need them to fix a few things ... 1) the co-op bug (if you are having this problem try turning off your phone power saver function - tried it and I didnt have that problem any more) but you shouldn't have to alter your phone's setting in order to play co-op that is just crazy ... 2) the control are a bit wonky and it takes a while to get used to them but I am missing attacks because there is not an auto lock function or the like ... finally 3) the drop rates ... horrible period ... dont worry about trying to get characters it is a waste of time and you can make the original cast that you get very powerful from the F2P model ... Hopefully they fix these three things but other than that the game is a blast to play and I am enjoying it thoroughly!,4
"I need to play games longer before reviewing them, because I judged this game harshly at first but it continues to grow on me. Belonging to what many call ""gotcha"" games, or I like to call oddly specific JRPGs built around acquiring characters with no bearing in an endless storyline, this game tends to be well above most in so many ways, most importantly just being fun. The battle system in early stages seems shamefully simplistic, but as you play more it slowly reveals it's layers to be still far from the most complicated action RPG but something engaging enough to be fun, while also being more exciting and faster paced for both the hardcore gamer who can sit down and absorb an entire chapter or two some afternoon or a casual gamer who wants to just enjoy a quick gaming fix in their downtime. I can't comment on how fair the game is to people who pay for content because I have yet to do that, but acquiring content for free seems thus far is fair and becoming of a nice experience. I have yet to acquire anything or anyone overly powerful for free, but I have enjoyed my crusty old warrior and my adorable little dragons nonetheless. The game also addresses my two largest criticisms of its genre: intermittent downloads, and obligatory feel of so many random characters. You can download the entire thing in one chunk, and all random characters have short unlockable stories you can view. So far I have yet to uncover anything groundbreaking in them, but they flesh out what would otherwise be a hollow faceplate. Overall, this is the strongest showing of this genre I've seen, and I strongly advise at least giving it a try.",4
Good storyline,5
Goooooooddddd,5
"For people stuck on avenue of power loading during room creation: turn off power saving mode. i read somewhere that it fixed issue for some, I tried and or worked for me.",5
The game play as well as a story seems pretty interesting but yet when you're stuck on a scenario where you have to create a room to go online and you wait a total of 3 hours or more and can not skip it there is no fun in the game anymore. Please fix this problem and maybe I'll play it again,3
"I only have 1 thing to say about this game and its Awesome! I love the story and especially the co op mode plus I love both companies that are running this game, pls keep up the amazing work",5
Can't get past the co-op tutorial please fix,3
Good,5
"Very great entry into Nintendo mobile games, it's entirely possible to beat it completely free to play. It has a high difficulty later on and raid mechanics. Excellent to play with friends or in your spare time",5
Great game and I like the story very different from other mobile games,5
Hard money grab with awful pull rates. Don't get thia game.,1
"This game is amazing, but the tutorial for co-op play won't load. Please fix",5
I love the game but my only problem now is that I can't play co-op anymore it can only play solo when it comes to the events and it's not fun playing solo pls fix this issue other then that it's a great game,3
"Still getting through the story but unlike most mobile games I'm actually quite interested in the story. The gameplay is pretty fun to, it's an action RPG that is simple yet fun! The gacha and power progression system is fair and the game gives you plenty of ways to progress without spending any real money. One extra little cherry on the top to add to the experience is that this game has co-op! You can matchmake or invite friends to play. Nintendo and Crygames made something really good here, I just hope that they plan to release some type of raid quest system in the future for some good endgame content.",5
"I don't know why we keep falling for this. It's the worst kind of f2p system, annoying stamina limits plus TERRIBLE roll rates for the gacha. Do yourself a favor and run the other way from this one.",1
"Good game with a refreshing control scheme. The control takes a little to get used to. At first it looks shallow, just run and spam attack. But once the controls are learned, like dodge, forced strike, the game play becomes deeper. I am not a fan of the cute big head 3d models but I guess its a jrpg tradition.",5
Weird controls for movement and attack (at least for me) but a great game,5
"Better than super Mario run, by far",5
It's a good game and I enjoyed playing it. I'd have rated this 5* if I could play. I can't continue as there is the coop tutorial bug. I haven't played in a few days which is sad might Uninstall soon,3
"Absolutely fantastic. This is one of the best-executed, highest production-value gacha games I've ever seen. The story writing of FGO, the mechanical complexity of FEH and the item structure of GBF. Awesome sound track, to boot. Definitely recommend it to gacha fans.",5
"Gave it a low rating because it forces me to do co-op, where i have to create a room and it just sitting there. I sat there for an hour and have closed the app to and reopened again and again but nothing.",2
It's what I expected and I got some nice 5-stars with my free 10 rolls. F2P isn't too bad so far since I just started but hopefully new content keeps the currency coming.,5
I'm kinda flabbergasted by these negative reviews. This game is one of the best mobile games I've played in a while. The anime style is phenomenal and the Japanese voicing cast is also top end. I love it.,5
Not worth the hype.. Deleted it soon after playing.,2
One of the best gacha games out there,5
It works the way it's supposed to but it's just boring. Once you've played a few levels you've done all you'll do in the game.,3
It's a gottcha game with stupidly simple mechanics geared to pull money from your wallet with as little game play as possible,1
"I love the mechanics of the game, the art is great, and I absolutely love the music.",5
Shut ass,1
you get stuck indefinitely in an endless loop,1
I could easily burn time on thus,5
"Seems like it could be fun, but even with the lowest graphical settings it lags like mad on my phone. Due to this the controls don't work well either, with the characters randomly changing direction without my moving or lifting my finger off the screen. Having a download notification pop up before every single mission is annoying, as well.",2
"Fantastic game, nice gacha machine",5
"Love the game, the controls are snappy. I have the note 8 and sadly this game lacks stylus support. I'm guessing note 9 users are finding that out as well. So there is a potential update you could include.",4
"Was really enjoying the game but I can't progress after chapter 2 part 1 because the tutorial for the events keeps making me host a co op session which puts my galaxy s7 on a infinite loading screen. Please fix, was really liking this game.",2
Because of a glitch where it gets stuck on the Create Room tutorial gotta give 1 star,1
Its a very fun game and even with the graphics on low it looks really good,5
Need a fix. I'm stuck at the Avenue of power tutorial where I have to create a coop room and it gets stuck loading.,2
"This game is pretty fun. For the people in the reviews complaining about the downloads at the start of every quest, there is a download all button in the system settings, so that you can download all of the game's data at once.",5
It's good,5
I cant get pass create room,3
Still not as good as Fire Emblem Heroes,3
"I am loyal Nintendo fan since the 80s. I've tried all the mobile games recently made by Nintendo. The only one I like is Mario Run. And that is because you pay once and don't have to deal with stamina or paying to advance. To the management, please stop following all the money grabbing app designers out there! I beg you to have a pay once version of all your games. Do a free add based version of each game or demo (Mario Run is a good example) then pay once to get the full version. I just discovered Monster Hunter stories was ported from 3ds. This is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. Please do your games like this and also allow for porting of old Nintendo games. I will pay for it! As for this game, I must sadly uninstall.",3
Shantreneika Harper is coffe weather,5
Once the Co-Op bug was fixed this game became super addicting. The music and the graphics are my favorite part about this game. It's the most fun I had with a mobile game.,5
A surprisingly good story for a mobile game with graphics impressive for a mobile game as well. This is a fun game with unique aspects that make it unlike any other gacha game. I have fun playing it and I look forward to future updates.,5
This game is one of the best mobile games I've played. Lots of voice acting. Amazing animation. Decent story. It's just fun without too much fluff like most other phone games.,5
So far I think the game runs really well. I haven't hit any pay walls and I haven't had anything glitch or freeze up on me.,5
Definitely addicting,5
"Great game! Has good story,riveting gameplay,and smooth controls.",5
"Interesting style of game. The way to move your character around the screen felt like it just didn't work very well. Also didn't really like the gameplay. The story was cool, but every level was the same thing: tap and swipe a bunch.",3
What,5
I cant get passed the creating a co-op room. Every time I get there the game just loads forever. Fix this I'll give more stars,2
Please fix the co-op it isn't loading,4
This game's tutorial is a soft lock. It keeps trying to bring me to the Avenue of power which did not work for me. It forces me to create a room but I cant even get into the room. And you cannot skip the tutorial. Please fix for better review.,2
It's a gatcha game. So far it feels free to play friendly which is great. The summoning rates are a bit abysmal though for characters 5 star but I guess the way coop is made and it's free to play friendliness offsets this. The game is fun great story too and music is addicting.,4
Fye,5
amazing game it won't let me get past the tutorial for doing a co OP game and I dont want to redownload the whole game again what can I do I wanna keep playing,5
"The gameplay is fun, but the rest of the game is needlessly complex. Also, having to constantly download segments of the game means this is a no-go for anywhere but home on WiFi.",3
Excellent story and gameplay,5
Good Game,5
"Wow. Really great story and overall loved it. The only real change I would want in this game is the ability to increase the stars on your dragon. I mean, I love this dragon so much, yet since its only three stars, it is not as powerful as the other dragons yknow? Other than that, best game ever.",5
"Great art/music, story has good personality. Gacha rates are terrible though",5
Keep getting stuck at the co-op mission after chapter two when there is no other players to join. Hope the developer can fix this problem.,3
Shut up and play.,5
LOVE this game,5
The co op create room won't load other than great game,4
Got suck on the co-op glitch loop. I've waited patiently for about 3 days and nothing. I'll rate it higher once the bug is fixed,1
Is pretty good but when i want to create a co-op room it doesnt work for some reason if they fix it that will be awsome.,4
"Nice story, and graphics! Only complaint is the summon rate could be a little higher but other than that fantastic game!",5
The past issues have been fixed and now I can play! I love it!!,5
"For those stuck in the loading screen at the coop tutorial, turn off your phones battery saver. Started working immediately for me afterwards, otherwise game is superb but not without its flaws. Controls could use some tweaking and for those complaining about the gacha drop rates would you rather rare be common?",5
"I've played tons of hero collector games and so far this game made it in my top 3 favorite mobile games. Everything about this game from the art to the music is very welcoming, and the combat system is pretty different from any hero collector I've played in the past so yeah great game so far.",5
"Unable to run on Nox or Bluestacks which is bad enough but also no auto play mode makes it get really tedious REALLY fast. I dont want to be constantly having to click,swipe,swoop,swip or whatever inane combo to play your game. There is a very good reason most mobile games have auto play as an option. Nobody has time for that nor the desire. It's not fun it's just annoying. Stop forcing it on us like you think that's what we want. If you do you are listening to the wrong people and not the majority hence your low scores. Next time have actual players test before putting out mechanics like this if you want to do well.",3
Dope,5
"The coop mode hasnt been working at all for me today, is there a problem with it?",4
I'm really enjoying this game. It looks and plays great imo.,5
Good game but the controls are wonky sometimes. Maybe its cuz I have a small screen but my dude ends up attacking air in the opposite direction of the enemies.,3
Bug can not load up a crate ur own room so I can not continue to play the game it will not let me do anything till I complete this tutorial part about co-op and so I can not play anymore please fix so I can still play.,1
Can't believe how much fun this game is.,5
"I think there is a BUG on the Co-op system,when I press the ""Create a room""as the gameplay tell me to,it just sits there for 5 minutes or more.I tried to redo it again and again but the BUG is still there,if you could solve this problem then I think this game will be better and I can move forward because it is a (MUST DO) thing in order to play deeply into this game.",3
So-so. Fun time waister. Worth the space.,4
Like it so far. Not sure how to describe what i dont like but it feels clunky and slow. Just something about it to me that makes it meh,3
First phone game I've enjoyed in a long time.,5
"While the game is serviceable for me at the moment, people saying the graphics are beautiful are not being clear enough. Its Final Fantasy DS remakes level. The gatcha isn't that bad right now but everyone is still earning a ton of the free premium currency and I see the gatcha costing Nintendo most of the player base once the constant stream of it dries up. If you want to follow the story you have to download abput 1.5mb for every chapter because I guess the extra data download didnt include the 2 paragraph scenes before missions. Overall I see me only lowering this score as time goes on, but as of now, worth waiting around to see what Nintendo does with it.",3
Ug,5
"Fresh take on a mobile RPG! Looks amazing, great story, action, and you can turn into an awesome dragon! It's awesome!",5
Hello where event raid LA?,5
This game is dope. I really love the mechanics. Its simole and the dialogue and story is awesomeee!,5
This is honestly really good. I don't ever recommend spending lots of money on these games. But this one is quite enjoyable. Haven't spent a penny but still feel good playing it. Hard to put down.,5
I've just started today and yet I've already fallen in love with the graphics and conroles really easy to get into plus the in game music is amazing!,5
"I absolutely adore this game. I know people may disagree, but in my opinion, this is one of the best gachas on the market right now and I'm not even afraid to say it.",5
"So far not bad. Thought the music was corny at first but it had me eating my words. The soundtrack is really good actually. I am upset because I spent to support as I see good potential, but my pulls were duplicates or not a single 5 star. I did a total of 5 10x pulls. 4 were 5 star and duplicates to the previous. But so far not as bad game at all. Needs a chat though. I used to think music like this was for gay weebs... But I just had to say that it is great! Where can I get the soundtrack? I want to make some EDM remixes if I may. I see great potential in this game. Give it a year to gain popularity and improvements It is going to be great.",3
Good game... still buggy. I'm stuck on the co-op tutorial... help!,2
Game is good yet it another game with 2.5gb space and sadly atleast 1.8gb internal even when it sent to sd card.,3
"How can i properly rate this game when it won't even open. Fresh download and it ""stopped working"" every time i pressed open. You can't stop working if you haven't worked yet.",1
great game. music is amazing with cool characters and rpg mechanics that makes you feel like your playing a console quality game. cant wait for the future pf thia game,5
"Its a fantastic game but there's a small glitch where the characters are shown as a black figure, not trying to be harsh or anything",5
Please add auto button,5
I did not finish the download because I was unaware that it took up almost 1.50 GB of space. I wish it took up less room. And maybe something to play offline as well.,1
"Really good game the only problem I can tell is the controls, sometimes just don't work the way you want it. But everything else 10/10",4
Leave it to Nintendo to churn out the most addictive game yet! So worth it too! I really enjoy that you don't have to spend a dime to truly enjoy yourself.,5
Great game,5
"Great game, good storytelling. Worst summon rates of any gacha game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of them. The only thing I don't like about the game is that when you summon it drops units, dragons and cards. I wish each type of thing had their own banners.",4
"i cant continue my game because i wanted to do the co-op tutorial and now im stuck, other than that the game is awesome controls are a slight problem but still decent for just clinching.",1
I would love to play this game but am not allowed as my phone comes unlocked so that sucks for me. Hope they can change that in the future seeing as there's nothing you could do on this game with a rooted phone anyways unless they just have 0 protection in game to anything.,2
"I EXTREMELY enjoy this game, its a more traditional mobile gotcha style game and with nintendos twist on it, it creates and amazing and fun game that has so many features compared to a normal gotcha game, This is a truly amazing game",5
Needs work with controlls,5
"Just saying this now, but if you want an afk lazy auto grinder, this is not the game for you. Take your time, learn the mechanics, and don't be one of those scrublords that don't dodge and wonder why they're dead then complain the game is too hard. Overall excellent story, graphics, and gameplay.",5
"So I got an update on what to try from the tech support and they suggested I turn off power saving mode to get past the co-op loading issue. Lo and behold I tried it and am finally able to progress further. Great work! Game is good up until the co-op tutorial started. Game is constantly loading, tried clearing cache and redownload but keeps loading and wont go past the screen.",5
It is good but I gliched through the wall and the only way to get out was to give up but other wise it was the best Nintendo game on the phone out their so far and I think they will probably fix it anyway.,5
The game is good but I'm constantly getting disconnected from Co-op mode,3
Love the art and gameplay. Wish the menus loaded faster but it's great,5
A little bit boring,1
My game is all lagy on big scenes and my characters are all blacked out. I hope an update fixes this major issue.,3
Stuck at creating co-op lobby,2
Best of 2018 sooo far. Keep up the work,5
Fun game. When does it stop asking me to download stuff?,3
I LOVE THIS GAME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,5
Fun and interactive,5
Good,5
The way you control the character is super bad. Instead of moving the character based off where they are. It moves them based off where your finger is. No way to change this at all. Gets a 1 from me for this and the bad dodge mechqnic,1
Meh. Just out right boring gameplay.,2
Story is okay not the best but good. The dungeon system & lack of difficulty made me quit. If you're going to play this I suggest you download all the levels together,3
"Beautiful graphics, great story, nintendo delivers yet again! Diggin it!",5
What does eldwater do?,5
"My girlfriend and I are seriously enjoying this game. Staying up together playing it. I was lucky enough to pull two 5* characters! Wonderful game, looking forward to what the future brings.",5
"I LOVE the music and im not really into these types of games except this one. I really like the comics this has in the ""more"" section. A tip to whoever starts this game blind, if you're team is lower than the recommended might go co-op. So to end this shortly i love everything of this game",5
"The game is recently new; it could be updated in the future to fix many issue such like crashes or bug. The game overall is actually fun. It contain a decent story with a good voice acting, which it allows me to engage to the narrative. I like the soundtracks, especially the one in the player menu. It have manga strips in the game, which somehow suprise me that the game have one. The gacha banner might have a low rate to get a 5-stars, but many quest and event can be beaten with 4-stars. Also, the game also give you couple them by playing though the story. And if you have struggling with a event, you could do Co-op. The system benefit everyone; it help make the event become easier to conplete, while rewarding people with in-game currency that can use for the banner for doing Co-op and helping newer player. Overall the game is a good game and it can be futher improve in the future.",5
It's a really good game i enjoy every aspect of the game.The only thing is that i have very very bad luck but I'm ok with it,5
Like the game but no auto...,2
Fun to coop with the family on the couch,5
Dragalia Lost©,5
Stuck in a tutorial loop. Unable to escape the matchmaking tutorial. The tutorial attempts to make a room but just sits on a loading fairy. Unable to progress. Once fixed i will update,2
The game is wonderful,5
I love the game it runs smooth and has a graphics setting it runs great and has great controls,5
"Having a lot of fun and so far any in-app purchases don't feel required. Just unlocked chapter 6 and hard mode, so I guess we'll see if that feeling continues.",5
First Gacha that has me hooked,5
"One of the best gacha games i have ever played. Story is amazing, character stories are amazing, graphics are amazing. The multiplayer feature is very well done. Also, unlike most other gacha games, you can beat the entire game and do post game very easily without spending a dime.",5
i think the overall game is great. only the coop has issue during one tutorial,4
I love this game its just when it says to do the co-op it just freezes or crashes. Please fix it!! I really like it,4
I only played it a few minutes. Wasn't enjoying it much.,3
Why the downloads,1
Lol,5
Epic sword and dragon adventure,5
Great game,5
My game is soft locked on a tutorial section that will not load. Can anyone help?,3
"Fun game, Nintendo makes the best gaming software.",5
Nice game!,5
THERE NEEDS TO BE RAIDS FOR DRAGONS AND CHARACTERS I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WOULD MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN AS WELL AS HAVING PVP!,5
nice,5
It's ok,5
Awsome,5
I like to play these games and I want more of these to. Brian Conlon,5
"Dragalia Lost is super beautiful! There's pretty art and lovely music that I can't stop listening to. I'm very much liking the story so far and the direction it's going in. I enjoy most of the characters, especially Luca, Emile, and Harle. However, it is new so there's quite a bit of issues. Character control is very clunky. I fixed it a bit by turning down the sensitivity, but it still doesn't feel fluid or easy to move. Summon rates are horrendous. Seriously. It's worse than both Fate/Grand Order and Kingdom Hearts Union Cross. I get there's not an enormous amount of characters yet, but it really would be better to separate the cards from characters and dragons in the summon pool. All but four of the four stars I've pulled have been cards and it's so disappointing when I see a four star card but no character or dragon. I haven't even gotten a five star of any kind yet either. Also, the game would benefit from having more things to do outside of the story. That's not a big deal though, since the game just came out. But having other kinds of challenges we could complete, along with perhaps guilds and all the things that come with that, would be nice as well. Maybe some kind raid boss thing going on would be interesting too. Really just more quests to do other than story would be great. Otherwise, Dragalia Lost is very good! As a story and adventure it's fabulous so far. As a game, its coming along nicely, but not quite there yet. Still, good work Nintendo and Cygames!",3
"Common guys, no one tested the co-op ""crate a room"" before release?! Otherwise, game is awesome.",3
"I love it now that they fixed the soft lock on the tutorial. I still dont get the issue about the p2p, you just need to keep playing and farm you dont need to pay to continue. If you cant put the time into the game to progress ofc you're gonna think you need to put money into it to get better mods. If you cant put the time into it then dont play games like this. Or if you have the money just give Nintendo your money who cares.",5
"I have been addicted to this game for a few days now. It's actually really fun! What I like most about this game is the pure design of the game. The characters look great and the UI is poppy yet satisfying to see. Compliment that with the catchy songs, and that was enough to keep me into this! Gameplay is also really fun, specially co-op! The controls can be a bit better however, as well as more giving more options for AI control. So far so great though! :)",5
Game is gud,5
A great Action RPG,5
Ridiculously generic and boring to play,2
"I love the game, but it has a few flaws. The controls could be better. I am also having the same problem as some other players with the permanent 2 2-1 Co-op loading screen. I would love to see this patched as I was ADDICTED to this game until that point.",5
Game would be great if i wasnt bugged and cant progress with no response from ingame or email support...,1
"So far it's a fun game. The summon rates are horrible, but even the 3 star characters can hold their own. I think in hard mode the stamina cost is too much. Two battles and then hours waiting for enough to go again.",4
"Haven't actually played the game yet will update once the download finishes. I just wish it would background download and I could use my phone, it's a 2 GB batch Download to remove downloading everytime you hit something new, but you cant leave the app while it downloads, must stay on that screen. Kind of annoying, since I don't have the best download speed, to have my phone pretty much be useless for like 45 min. Guess it's a download while I sleep.",3
The co-op is always messed up,1
"Dont listen to the people who keep rerolling for 5* units, the game has features that make any unit viable and upgradable to 5*.",5
Beautifully made game but I'm stuck like everyone else at the co-op section. I'd love to play but it's been three days and no changes.,2
"Good game, didnt spend a dime and I'm progressing well :)",5
"Everything from Music, gameplay and character design is amazing, my only gripe is how short levels are also please add a pvp mode or longer levels just anything to keep my pulled in would be nice",5
"Nintendo sues to shutdown Colopl's Shironeko Project, because of this game being an inferior version of SNP.  Cygames then plagiarises its own games, ""porting"" existing characters to this game under a different name. I like this game's 2D art, and it's easier to do that by not playing the actual game.",2
Awesome,5
The best release from Nintendo for awhile,5
Yeetus skeets,4
"Items, characters, and dragons in the same pull was a big no thanks for me.",3
Really good game,5
"I love it!! The story is interesting, funny and nice! I love the battles and all the gameplay!! 😊",5
takes all day to download,3
"The game itself is very fun and storyline is intriguing but the whole having to follow the on screen directions when they are teaching you something is kind of frustrating where I am at. Now that I can do events, I am ""walked"" through and I have to play co-op and create a room. Wouldn't be a bad thing first time through except it is loading forever, and I can't skip this instructional part of the game so I can't collect anything or progress through the story. I have tried waiting for the room to load but it was loading for half an hour and I can only imagine it was physically building the room. Jumping into a room might have been easier but I don't have a choice since the game makes you make a room. But all in all it is a good game just needs to work out the bugs. Otherwise I am stuck in chapter 2 forever and not sure when I can progress.",4
"Awesome game. I dont know why people is saying its pay to play, but I'm getting through the contents just fine.",5
"The game isn't all that I expected it to be. I dislike that the characters look like bobble heads and that their always dancing, it just makes it feel a little TOO childish. Once again, getting a 5 star hero is incredibly hard, and getting a specific one? Pf.. good luck with that. Not only that but getting the needed resources for summoning is a little hard for the chances to be that low. The idea for the game, even though not very original, is good enough, and the story is pretty straight forward.",2
"Fantastic mobile game, I love the music in Regalia Lost! If you like RPG games definitely play this one!",4
"It's Granblue Fantasy 2, but this time it doesn't feel like working a second job when you play it.",5
"It's kind of slow and boring. The story seems neat, but the gameplay has little depth and the charged attacks (required to break shields) is hard to do.",2
Crashes a lot. Good game though.,3
Pretty boring and ugly.,2
Game unplayable after chapter 2-1 due to co-op bug,1
Yeet,3
Favorite dentist game of all time,5
I love it,5
It's good all these plebs that don't understand what mobile games are about should go back to the console that your mommy or daddy bought you,5
"This game is epic! I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it since I don't usually like Gacha games but this is so much fun. The story seems pretty familiar at first but gets more diverse later into the game. The music and voices are incredibly well done and make me wish that more scenes had voice acting. Getting new characters especially star ones isn't any more difficult than it needs to be and you don't need to spend money to have fun. This was an easy 5 star game for me, can't wait to see what more it has to offer.",5
i am unable to continue freezes at a required coop start if fixed and i would eate 5 star really like the game play pretty good graphics as well.,1
Great game play on note 9 and no issues fantastic and generous rewards easily able to get diamonds for summon simply by playing game and coop fun time waister,5
Cant connect to server,1
It wouldnt let me play and i think it gave me a virus,1
"So far I'm enjoying this game. So much things to do and you can build and upgrade your castle and its amenities. It gives you the chance to also upgrade and optimize your characters. Controls are a bit weird but it doesnt bother me. I like it. I play alot of mobile games and it's nice to have a new anime chibbi-like game to play with dragons, fairies, and a range of characters to play as :) There are not that many glitches like people have all the stupid reasons to complain about. I play on my galaxy note 9 and in my galaxy tab s3 and so far it's been all running smooth...note to others giving bad reviews: maybe it's not the game but your phone that's the issue, simple as that. Otherwise I would have had the same issues as you are experiencing but I haven't and I'm already at chapter 4....",5
Greatest yet from nintendoo!!,5
"This game is really addictive, I've been playing the game for the past three days nonstop. Well done Nintendo well done 👍",5
"Play it. If you Like it cool if you dont okay. It's a game where your able to summon to get cool new characters. Alot of mobile games are like this but, this is developed by Nintendo so this game runs really smooth and the music is nice not an ear blast but enjoyable to hear. Fun intuitive and gives you alot to do for a just released title!",5
Please fix create room,4
"How are people having so many problems with this game? It's like they're playing a different game. The one problem I can agree with is the controls, as they're kind of wonky, but the rest is fine.",5
This is the best game for phone EVER!!! Leave to nintendo to give you the best story lines,5
Loved it,5
Can't even connect to the server I try logging in days now,1
"Ignore the extremely nitpicking reviews on Android, it's a great gacha with a bunch of depth added on. Thank you Nintendo and Cygames!",5
Loading BUG,1
"Well my review on this game is at pause atm cause I'm not sure after experiencing a loading bug during the Avenue of Power tutorial after clicking on create a room. This bug been happening several time now, I tried to reset my internet and wifi connection and still it didn't work. Pls address to this matter asap. I really enjoy playing Dragalia Lost.",1
"Great soundtrack, love hearing Daoko. Unfortunately, the gameplay itself is undeserving of such an amazing collection of tunes. Controls feel off and don't allow for a direction of attack after you go in a direction unless if you pause, which makes you reset your attack combo. Focus attacks should have a toggle for aiming by either pulling forward or backward, depending on preference. Overall, everything is setup for a fantastic game, but if the gameplay itself is lacking, then there is a core problem.",2
It's an amazing game however i judge games strongly based on how they release. The fact that one of the largest gaming companies releases a game with an issue that gets you stuck infinitely even in you uninstall it or close it so you cant play untill it updates is ridiculous. Along with the fact that it's a major issue affecting every person who makes it far enough and every day you wait to update no one can play...,1
It's an excellently crafted game with so much stuff to I can't put it down! And it's not p2w!,5
"I absolutely love this game! I haven't gotten very far yet, but I can tell its absolutely awesome. My only issue is that it was difficult to find the settings to do the batch download of all the extra files, but I eventually found it! Other than that, I think it's perfect (:",4
"This game is literally a masterpiece. The combat is the best I've ever seen from a gacha game and the story is amazing. The fact that it's a gacha game doesn't even matter since you can easily beat the game with the tutorial units. Also you get tons of free summons. This game has action rpg combat, town building, REAL TIME CO-OP, and visual novel elements. This game deserves way more praise than it is getting.",5
"Dragalia Lost is a fun and addicting game! I personally love the mechanics, art, and and voice acting for this game, it shows that nintendo worked pretty hard on this game. The only problem i have about the game is that it uses a lot of storage on my phone, but its worth it!",5
Bad game to play if you have things to get done in life.,5
"First a bowser on a dragon Then this Nintendo, I am proud of you for making more dragons",5
"Very fun and cute, got me hooked quick! Sometimes the walking controls can get a bit annoying but even so the games still fun.",5
Dudee totally surpassed my expectations! Nice job Nintendo,5
Only playing this for DAOKO,5
"I think people are being a little too harsh about the game being a Gacha. I personally love RNG type of games and this one is pretty unique in its own way. The characters are adorable, the story is exciting, and the graphics are amazing. The only thing I would criticise would be the controls seem a little weird, but maybe I just have to get used to them :)",5
"amazing graphics, decent controls and fun co-op. ❤️❤️❤️ people rating this game lowly are seriously confused.",5
"This game is amazing and is by far in my opinion Nintendo's best mobile game yet!!! The soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay while basic, is fun and engaging, the graphics are good for a mobile game and TBH I hope to God Nintendo puts this on the Nintendo Switch and the save data is shared between consoles. I love you Nintendo keep up the great work x3 Edit: Nintendo Or Cygames please fix the tutorial on Co-Op it won't load after I tapped on create a room! I'd love to keep playing. Please Fix this Issue 😥.",4
"I'm a fan of Gatcha games, and have tried out a LOT of them. This is by far the best. I'd describe it as midcore. It's not as grindy or complicated as Summoners War, but has enough meat on the bones to keep you engaged. Also, the plot, characters, and little side stories are great!",5
Even though I think this game is awesome I've played it for about 10 minutes and so far it is a storage hog after the first download starting the game gig and a half download after the first chapter another gig download,5
"Good game, but my crappy internet and phone makes it hard for me to play. But if you have a good internet connection PLEASE download and play it.",4
"The game needs work. Game play is almost smooth, but is a bit choppy at some parts, also movement options can be vastly improved constantly moving my finger around is dumb and blocks the screen I even do it at the bottom of the screen and I have the same problem. Cinematic cutscenes however are the worst, the voice acting is amazing that isn't the issue it's that the cutscenes like to freeze and hang a lot I sat wait for the first cinematic to stop freezing for 10 minutes till I gave up and reseted the app.",3
I liked it but i cant be a girl??,5
"Stylish, and a feast for the eyes and ears, but the gameplay is a bit uninspired, the movement is clunky, and the Guard Break mechanics are flawed and unreliable. Co-op doesn't really require co-operation, either, which is a bit disappointing. Lastly, the summon rates are terrible and the summon pool is diluted with less useful categories. Needs a lot of tweaking and adjustments before this becomes a truly great game.",3
wouldn't even boot up the tutorial section once I finished downloading the extra data :/,1
A great perfect game. Thanks for the producers from japan. I be on this game for sure.,5
"""network error has occurred"" shows a 4 bar on my wifi..... I have restarted the app, restarted my phone but this network error keeps occurring....",1
This Game is AMAZING !! Love the Characters and the Story !! I wish it was a Console Game for the Switch,5
I don't know what you are talking about glitching and stuff it works fine for me!,5
There's a problem connecting to events when accessing the events its stays on the loading screen I've cleared the cache numours times even redownload the game and there still problems connecting,3
Best,5
stuck in co-op tutorials. don't know if that's a bug or noone really plays the game,3
みんなFE知らんのか…この闇鍋は任天堂の仕業やぞ…。地に落ちたな…コロプラとちちくりあってればいいものを…。ソシャゲ巧者のサイゲが今更こんなアホみたいなガチャする訳ないだろ…キャラデザぐらいのもんだろ噛んでるの,1
Good,5
Controls are terrible which make the game play terrible. Draw rates are awful too. Everything else is pretty good though.,3
the game is addictive but the story is a bit too repetitive. that's a minus.,4
Nintendo outdid themselves this game's the music is breathtaking and the gameplay is fun would recommend,5
"Like it but there are so many downloads, each time you go to a different quest it needs to download a lot of MB so your phone will get full very easily, I would play this game much much more if it wasn't for the unbelievable amount of downloads...uninstall.",3
So I wish I could play this but every time I start it up and it asks me for my settings it totally hard locks my phone and I have to restart it. I would really like to know what the deal is and if this is being worked on at all.,2
The Legend of Dragoons,5
Nintendo is getting good at making slot machines.,5
Awsome,5
Really fun game and always has nonstop action plus the storyy is suspense filled.,5
It has the best music and voice acting I've seen in a mobile game. No pvp or clan gameplay currently but lots of other content on the pve side. Very story driven but executed very well. This game has captured my attention.,5
"•It's fun and all but, I can't get past the tutorial for the ""Avenue to Power"" because it nevet loads. I let my phone be for an hour and the stupid game never opened a room. I have pretty good connection here and it really dissapoints me that this didn't manage to load. If anyone could help me out somehow that'd be great.",3
"it's a good game, yet no matter what I cant connect to any co-op missions. I dont know if it is because I use data but you guys need to fix this so I can fully enjoy the game",3
"Awesome game, not sure why the ratings are so low. It's a gacha game. Nobody is hiding it",5
"Therr is promise here but a lot of growing to do. The gameplay is fun and straightforward, but the main screen and menus are cluttered and confusing. It is a gacha game so expect plenty of disappointment, especially as the rates are low and split even further into three types of resources. But I suspect some of the above will be worked out in time. Just don't link a Nintendo Account just yet and wait for updates.",3
Lot of graphics issues. All the characters are just shadows. If it worked right it would probably be great.,2
It's very fun. In app purchases not forced,5
"The game's great, don't get me wrong, but there are minor issues. Like when you get weapons, the background is kinda messed up, as well as co-op rooms only connecting over mobile data, not Wi-Fi. If those get fixed, this game would be amazing, as it is now, it's average at worst, above average at best.",4
This game is very nice. The gameplay is simple yet challenging. There are combat strategies involved if you want to get through a stage or beat a boss to get a rewards. And you can do that with other players through co-op. Have a good healer and everybody welcomes you.,5
they fixed the co-op issue for me. turn off power saver. then try it. talked to support and that's what they told me. worked like a charm,5
"Nintendo used to be good, now they are just like Activision trash",1
"This game is honestly pretty engaging once you get and going, the purchasable shop items aren't even worth it which makes me feel a lot easier since some games of similar genre encourages one to invest just to get good things.",5
Amazing game cute graphics cool game play.,5
Love it,5
"good game, nice graphics, controls are bit hard and gacha will surely hook you into to paying",5
"Stuck during Avenue of power tutorial.. wants me to create a room but then never creates it.. I was enjoying it , but now I cant continue.",2
"Coop fixed, games great fun overall.",5
This is one of the best mobile games I have ever played. Nintendo and the app developer have knocked it out of the park!!,5
The game is spectacular but it won't let me do the event tutorials it just gets stuck,5
This is trash i only see a whige sreen,1
Games pretty freaking awesome never thought I'd see Nintendo come out with a Gacha game it's pretty fun love the characters lore story's and game play OST is pretty damn good and I plan to play the game for a long time 😎,5
I'm stuck in a tutorial where it forces me to create a room for Avenue to power. When I hit create a room it just gets stuck loading and never gets past it.,1
"Fun game, great graphics, well made",5
"Constant cannot connect to server issues and app stability issues. Game is beautiful, controls are great, gacha system is not even too bad, could use more in the home castle. Sadly the connection and stability issues are overwhelming and make the game playable for only about 20 minutes before spending almost an hour to fix. Higher rating pending fixes for these issues.",4
This rpg style game is amazing i love the grafics and i love the dragons and the character overall,5
Failed to connect to the server I just install it and can't play,1
The style was cool but you have to download new data for literally everything you do,2
Awsome,5
"I love the game, but in the movement I would like to see a tap and move option",5
I've been addicted since it released. Very lovely graphics and cute art style. Since Nintendo and Cygames worked on this I knew that it would be a bit grindy and gacha would be difficult. I still enjoy it all the same. Can't wait to see what they have in store for us in terms of events and what not.,5
"I was genuinely excited for this game, and im proud to say that It has yet to disappoint me. I totally recommend you play this amazing game.",5
Sucks,1
It controls leave it to be undesired clunky glitchy just port it as a switch game it could really shine.,3
"I like this game, but it just crashes a lot. Literally unplayable unfortunately. Everything about this game is good, but the game just crashes so much",2
The game didn't run properly,1
Could've been a 5 star if I can see the characters.,3
SUPERIOR GACHA GAME,5
Enjoyable but a lot of downloads.,4
"This game was dumb,constant downloads for each quest...",1
Note 2 self: need to download 1.2 gigs of file as soon as the game start. It also asked to create a Nintendo account to save game progress instead of using Google play. Uninstalling,2
It pretty good,5
"Been looking for a grindy game to play on my computer but I surprisingly found it on my phone. It has a lot of elements from other games that I really like and I may be of the few minority that actually likes the gacha. It doesn't feel too unfair and gathering the wyrmgems to do a 10 summon isn't that hard if you just play the game. My only issue with it is it does have a few minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking, and the controls are a bit difficult and hard to get used to which a lot of people will complaining about. Overall , the game is enjoyable and the soundtrack being Daoko just completely sold me.",5
"I am really loving this game, the only thing so far is that when ever it is requiring me to create a lobby on a co op event mission tutorial, it just gets stuck loading so I can't progress any further. Restarting the app does nothing. Please help me fix this!",5
First mobile game I played that has a engaging story. Controlls are simple but doesn't dumb down gameplay. The gacha system is honestly not bad with the amount of crystals you get to do pulls. I can easily say this is a great mobile game.,5
"It's just another Japanese ARPG, but it looks pretty and is well translated. Be warned there's a huge download before every level and you can't play offline.",1
This is far the best game ever but pls make it offline if you can,5
Similar to ShiroNeko Project but with more stuff.,5
Honestly.... takes to long to get started. Plus all the downloads through out the tutorial in the beginning. I just want to play.... but turned me off. Sorry,1
"Quite surprised at low reviews on this game. I've played many gacha mobile games and this is one of the very few that are fair and fun. Most of all it is entirely composed by my favorite artist, DAOKO. Definitely one of the best games on the phone so far.",5
"May I say, that this game is amazing? I have played countless game in my life and Nintendo always seems to manage to always pull me back. The controls are very slightly iffy when you attempt to change directions as you traverse dungeons, but aside from that the game is amazing! The combination of gameplay/music/controls is marvelous, that sometimes I get so lost in the game and the amazing works of music that I do find myself tearing up! Well played, Nintendo, and we'll made! 5 out of 5 stars for music 4.7 out of 5 stars for controls 5 out of 5 stars for the game's handling Also, to those that have crashing issues or lag issues, either lower the quality and smoothness or upgrade your phone/device, as I have YET to encounter problems of your sort. If the game seems to be running slow, lower the quality. If the game keeps crashing, get an upgrade. No one at Nintendo is at fault for your issues, only device or processing issues. I run this game on a ZTE Blade X MAX with no issues at the lowest quality, I have made it to Chapter 4, and still none of these problems that you all keep facing.",5
Best rpg game ever,5
"THIS IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAY ON ANDROID, why still some people giving 3 stars above, are you all stupid The music background in all gameplay and the art of the game is really fantastic Nothing bad i think, its still have the best story with all japan voice actor really enjoying me to play this game for more futher Thanks nintendo",5
Its annoying it took so long to DL then has to DL more. Right now game is stuck loading as I just reached the Co OP mode...,4
"I really enjoyed this game, then it forced me to do the tutorial for coop missions and it never loaded, tried reloading app and re installing it nothing... Been like this for 2 days already.",3
Great game,5
Marvelous,5
Love it,5
Movement and combat controls are horrible.,2
After days of not connecting finally works and it's fun. I enjoy the music and the voice acting isn't too cringy/cheesy. Haven't hit a wall yet where it's impossible to play without paying to win.,4
Needs auto loot with the auto play button,5
I know its still a new game just coming out just wanted to say I keep getting an authentication error and support code 400 don't know what to do,3
Great game. Something for everyone,5
Great,4
So this game is really well made hearing the title screen music drew me in kinda feels like a mash up of all of Squares games mixed with Breath of Fire with the dragon transformations. Now my issue with this is you have to parent your game 100% as the auto funtion is beyond bad as it doesn't pick up loot nor pick up money or use skills. Like they made the game to much of a baby sitting game. I wanna be able to put my game on auto while im cooking etc. If the auto system isn't improved i fear the game itself will just suffer. The other issue is there is no dungeon system? Or maybe that will be co-op mode? So far the biggest issue is the auto funtion as it makes it depressing you have to manual 90% of it DURING AUTO WHICH IS NOT OK...,3
"Bravo Nintendo! I'm big jrpg fan. Also have played and still play quite few gacha games. I can tell without a doubt this high quality mobile gaming. Love the story, the music, the characters. You can beat everything with just the story line characters. I think people just like to hate on Nintendo for not making everything they make 100% free which is crazy. This game is completely f2p nothing like Fire Emblem which I quit pretty fast after release. This is a real jrpg and the storyline units can get you through. I was worried after fire emblem but the company you co created this beauty with deserve praise. Bottomline 9/10 so far. If the game didnt have purchasable items which is not needed at all plus a lot of freebies at that there wouldn't be a game. My guess is kids leaving reviews not actual true adult gamers. Reminds of the old RPGs with likable characters and story. Thanks again you destroyed my skepticism and I'm so happy to finally find my Nintendo rpg cause I know it will stay updated.",5
Servers never connect.,1
This game is amazing. I don't understand the many low reviews.,5
Another generic gacha heroes collecting/upgrading game. Gameplay isn't that different from other single finger kill everything in the level to win. Story isn't all that unique or interesting. I was never a fan of this...chibi-ish art style. Generic game with Nintendo branding behind it.,3
"The itself is amazing Story is good, graphics, gameplay, everything But on chapter 2 if you do the co op event mission You'll be stuck. Restarting the app doesn't work Not even REINSTALLING works. Please fix this I was trying to grind out the quests and get that sweet prize.",4
They need to update it to where it doesn't take forever for the first event quest you do to create a room. That is still messing up and I've restarted the game 8 times!!!. Fix your game Nintendo,4
Its great i might do a video on YouTube for this game!,5
"Stuck at beginnings when tutorial wants you to go to events, then click co-op. Once i hit co op thats it, stuck loading i suppose with a graphic of solid white fairy dancing at bottom right no matter how long i wait. Would rate better if it was playable",4
Cool game,5
Good combination of grind and story telling. I enjoy it more than the other games in this genre.,4
I love it and please make an anime of this PLEASE NINTENDO,5
Turn this into a full blown franchise on the switch,5
"Really fun game and my god, the music is AMAZING. Fun gameplay and great art style. I really appreciate that there's Japanese music and dual audio. Always nice to have the option to have the original Japanese voices.",5
Summon rates aren't that great. Having three types of things in one summon is terrible. The game also got boring very fast.,2
As soon as the option for coop appears the guide tells me to go to coop click make my own room and then freezes. Game was awsome fix and u will get 5 stars please or disable the guide for me so I can continue playing. I do have screenshots aswell,1
I'm loving it so far. The rates seem kinda low but there is a good amount of grinding to max out characters and weps. Can't wait for more content!,5
"So far, so good. High level of polish with free-to-play mechanics.",4
Shud have been turn based . The gameplay is worst than Shaq fu on xanex. I think the concepts and lore are amazing and perfect for a new ip but the beatum up style only works if there is a motive to keep tapping the screen. EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE GAME IS PERFECT except the GAMEplay itself.,2
Game would stop at a loading screen when doing the tutorial for a party.,2
"Fun game, interesting story line. Only problem is having to do one big download after installing, then downloads for each additional section. Gets to be too much space for small hard drive devices.",4
Awesome game!!!,5
"The game is pretty fun at the moment, but since it is new expect to face at least a single problem when playing it. Besides that, the graphics and gameplay work well with each other. The most notable feature in this game is the increase in rate for SSR every 10-pull if you did not receive one in the previous. Which is very forgiving if one is not very lucky when pulling for a SSR.",4
Didn't even run on my phone,1
"graphics are excellent, was quite happy with it until I saw that cluttered overcrowded home screen..too many menus..isnt there away to hide them until you need to use them? I'm sure something as simple as equipping a sword will be overly complicated.just overly complicated.",4
I did not install the game but I have a lot of time,5
I already wrote a review. I like it. Can't wait to try to do summons! (I'm at 70 waiting hehehehe),5
Frozen at forced tutorial for co-op play.,1
Loving this game so far. No issues encountered and story is really great. It feels like a quality mobile RPG experience. Thank you Nintendo,5
"Incredibly buggy, almost infuriatingly so. I got some good drops from summoning, but they don't appear in my roster or inventory. There's also issues with the shop and some rewards collecting. The game is a good idea, but it was not ready to launch. Debug team should lose their jobs for approving this roach infested nightmare.",1
Fun. More voice acting would have been 5stars for me. Movement controls are a little...off. especially aiming charged attack,4
"Hyper polished presentation, but a rather bland IP for Nintendo.",3
Great game overall,5
Loved it,5
"Decent graphics, but the game is really basic and not very fun. Controls are weird and clunky and a little obstructive on the screen. Tap to kill monsters and slide your finger to walk. Not what I expected.",3
Awesome game. Feels different than other Android games. I'm a fan.,5
The controls sucked,2
"By far, my favorite mobile game I've ever played! Other mobile games are okay and interesting but Dragalia Lost, has captured my gamer heart!",5
"Absolutely Obsessed. Amazing storyline, fantastic voice acting, and great tutorials makes this one of a kind. Thanks Nintendo. Hope to see this on the switch soon.",5
"It's a great, we'll perform game.",5
It's not letting me play the game. It says authentication error.,1
Awesome new IP,5
"Many issues that need fixing, hopefully soon... but still loving the game",5
"Ridiculous that you need to download 1.25GB, yes that's Gigs... Got bored waiting for download, so I uninstalled. Let down.",1
Summoning.,1
Fun game with great music and online!,5
"Was really impressed with how fun this game is! My only issue would be how I'm able to direct the characters during a dungeon but that's most likely cause my screen is not the best. Either way, wasn't expecting much but was surprised by the gameplay, music and writing, even if it is very typical rpg. It also most definitely is a gacha game but so far I haven't had run into a p2p wall just yet.",5
Awesome everything,5
Takes forever to download even on super fast WiFi.,1
Avenue to Power is bugged. Game craps out when creating coop room,1
Nintendo with cygames is a one 2 punch man the graphics are cute the 2d artworks are amazing the gameplay is simple yet fun and microtransations are a luxury,5
"Good for a mobile game, just so much storage needed",3
IT'S SO FUN,5
Horrible controls!  It's very painful to move my character around. I hope they would think of better way in the future to control our character.,1
This is a great game but it loads very slow sometimes and I'm on Wi-Fi,5
"Gacha with Nintendo quality. For now, I'm in.",5
So I'm trying to do the forced to co-op mission and I 've been sitting on the loading screen for 10 mins. I think the mission is bugged,4
One of the best mobile rpg games that there is available hands down,5
Really fun and story driven.,5
"coop bug loading in infinite loop, should not have to clear cache and even that does not work",1
Awesome game! Just try it and you'll see 😁,5
"Just another summon a random hero and complete mini quest with no real character development. Summon a random hero, hoping for a 5 star. I was seriously hope for a REAL rpg game from Nintendo. Oh and the controls are really bad.",3
"Controllers are very intuitive, and even though it is a gatcha game, its not impossible to become stronger without money. The gameplay and graphics is smooth, I'm not getting any lags like people are saying, but i am running a galaxy s9, so I'm not sure my rating for lag is valuable. Love they style, its kawaii af.",5
"Great storyline, great characters, and great gameplay. Just an all around fun game overall that is adventurous.",5
I have lost my account after reset my phone factory mode,2
It's fun.,5
Good base game right now with clear improvements in control possible. Story and graphics look great and waiting for updates,4
"Really liking this, it's simple and fun. I would like an option for different controls though as I sometimes have issues with this.",5
"Awesome graphics and gameplay, but I'm stuck in the tutorial where you are supposed to create your first multiplayer room, not too far into your game, but it won't create the room and there's no clicking on anything else, even for help.",4
Awesome one handed rpg,5
Fun game but can't play right now because it's trying to force me to do co-op for the tutorial but it isn't working. Could there at least be an option to bypass the tutorial until you wish to try co-op? Lol.,3
Overall this is a great game that Nintendo & Cygames devoloped. There's a lot to do in the game and the graphics and story elements in it makes me not want to say this is even a mobile game. Definately trying out!,5
Unknown,5
"This game is great. The only thing I'm not so sure of is that they tried making various games into one such as the building mode like if it was a clash of clans clone. It's the first I've seen in a gacha game. The gameplay is simple, like literally just tap the screen. This game reminds me alot of GrandBlue and it has many elements of it, such as the summons, weapon, and character system just much simpler with the added card buff thingy. Voice acting and music really set the tone for the fights and moments in cutscenes except one part. Btw if your tired of downloading everytime you enter a mission just download all data from the get go. It'll save you alot of time. Draw rates are good compared to FGO, great gacha game as well, so it's not to hard in getting characters compared to a 1% out of a 100%. Still it's a gamble but you know what your getting into if you played other gacha games. All in all great game. Looking forward to the future.",4
"There is no shying away from the gorgeous graphics this game boasts. That's about the only thing this game has going for it, though. Between the maze of options and short gameplay, this feels nothing like a game at all. You're constantly going through menu after menu. The tutorial fairy tries to explain parts of the game by having you flip through the options, but it's so convoluted that it's impossible to keep up with what you're actually doing. If you want to play a game instead of opening a bunch of menu options I highly recommend another game.",2
Good game but I can play it because I did the tutorial for coop and it just stays on the loading for creating a room,2
Failed to connect to lobby every time,1
Really been enjoying the game so far!,5
"I love it and just wanna say to those out there appreciate all the characters you get when you don't link account I got Jeanne D ark and the other 5 star char. Tba says she's a genius both on second multi summon, and the idiot I was for deleting the game... So never take for granted what you have. Don't and I repeat DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. Cause now I doing everything in my power to get back to give them what they deserve respect and a good leader that does everything he can to make them stronger and it also goes for every other char I get. But 10/10 game so far has so much potential now I gonna farm to do another multi summon and hope that I can make a difference.",5
Is a good game just is to hevy have to down load every single stage of the quest is kind of boring.... but is a great game i recomended,4
"The game is really fun and interesting, but when I was going through the main story I got stuck on the co-op tutorial and it makes everything else unplayable. It really sucks since I was looking forward to playing this more, but for now I guess I'll have to wait until it gets fixed.",4
"I wasn't even able to play this game. It takes was too much memory and space on my phone that it wouldn't even work or run. Kept crashing. Should be away that it takes up less space on phones and can run better. If internet is needed for playing, I see no reason why so much is needed on phones. When I looked 1st how much was needed, it said 300 mb. But then when I started the game it said it needed to download another 1.6 GB ... I think that almost 2 GB is way too much.",2
"Navigating the web of menus is a nightmare. I'm having a hard time with the controls. There should be an option to change control style. You are inundated with menu after menu of information. As soon as you get a new character you are prompted to summon and upgrade another one. The art style, graphics, and music are actually really great. I love it. I'd rather pay 10-15 dollars for this game upfront and have it be polished and more user friendly.",3
Solid game just needs time and feedback to improve,5
Great but it lags when I go into the Co-Op. Right now its lagging so bad the Tutorial wont let me continue the story until I create a room. :(,4
"Great is game but the controls are so bad and the drop rates are below sub-par. When moving around and I have to make a turn, my thumb reaches the end of my phone. When using a force strike, rather than holding my character would just move and ruin my positioning. Still a great game but just please give us an option to have a joystick or a D-pad somewhere....",3
"Deceptively simple controls that flow easily, amazing graphics, and a fantastic story line. The only down side is how expensive the in game micro transactions are but that is usual for this genre of mobile app.",5
I think it's awesome turning to dragons so cool,5
"Game doesn't even open, says authetification error",1
I can not progress with the game. When it comes to creating a room for the event it just stays loading,3
"alright so the games cool, but I'm at the part where co-op is introduced a d it's taking a while to load",4
Loved the game however I believe that adding a fixed joystic may make moving around easier and there is a large bug in which during the co-op tutorial it gets stuck loading forever if fixed I would like this game much more,4
"I want to believe the current grinding of this game is so unbalanced because is a new release but knowing how Cygames works I shouldn't be surprised, grab the whole concept of Shironeko Project and everything but the easy farming for event runes and divided into one big collect-athon like granblue with a gacha somehow worse than Fate GO and you get this, I'm really disappointed because mobile games are about casual play and this games just goes all against that concept, hopefully it'll get better but for now is just bad.",1
"This game as a whole has alot of potential. It has alot of great rpg elements and it isnt too complicated like other games. Management of skills, equips, and other things ate easy to understand. I love the stat increase character building, reminds of final fantasy xiii. The ability to turn into a dragon really changes the gameplay and the possible combinations. After playing it for a few days, I've uninstalled alot of my other games since this one had all the elements I liked from the other games. Summon rates are not too bad but its expected from any gacha game. The co-op is fun too and runs smoothly. Servers are sometimes slow, but its expected since it's a new game. Great job with this game! I look forward for the upcoming updates to make it better. Gameplay: 5/5 Server Connection: 4.5/5 Character development: 5/5 Storyline: 5/5 Overall: 5/5",5
"The game is really fun, but there was a sad thing that happened, when I did a tenfold summon, the game closed (stopped working) and when I got back on, my wyrmite disappeared and I didn't get anything for it.",5
"Oh my lord, this game is fantastic. So far the story is compelling but maybe a bit predictable. I guess I have to find out. BUT PLEASE RELEASE THE SOUNDTRACK ON SPOTIFY PLEASE.",5
"If this game is on switch, it will be more awesome, gameplay is great, control is a bit hard but its ok nonetheless, the story is really good, too good that i can't skip it, and my favorite is the music, All in all great game, good job nintendo, this game will be enough reason for me to buy switch if it's on switch.",5
Ok,3
Cool characters and great combat,5
Nice action RPG with great animation and story.,5
Whoa I was coming here to post about how much I loved this game then I see super low ratings for some reason! I just want to make sure that people know this is a fun game!,5
Good,5
Too many downloads. I just downloaded the in game content played the first mission but now I have to download more data!! I fought with my storage for 6 hours to play one chapter!! Ridiculous. Besides that amazing game!,4
It's good but it runs a coop tutorial that will not load,3
Fun so far. Definitely a gacha game but the mechanics in this one are really well polished.,4
Amazing.,5
"This is a very well made phone game just luke fire emblem heroes, I'm enjoying the story, characters, amd how I can even learn more on certain ones if I wish. My one problem is that the control to move is clunky, the UI looks cool and all and its a unique way to move around but I think a separate setting for those who may feel the same as me with a regular joystick and maybe a separate attack button could work better, besides that keep up the good work.",4
It would be a lot better if the achievement / event rewards would work I won the daily bonus all four times and it wouldn't give me the achievement,3
"To those who are having problem on chapter 3 Loop for Co-op, you have to turn of power saving in order to work.",5
This game is unique and no stupid auto play. You done good 😁,5
It's a good RPG game,5
Fun great,5
There is a neverending click fest of menus and dialogue that you have to go through. Also super annoying it keeps asking to download something constantly why wasn't it all included in the initial download jeeze.,3
"So disappointing. This game actually had pretty good controls for a mobile game and it seems very interesting. Too bad Nintendo has sold out when it comes to stuffing their games full of gambling and microtransactions. Understand that when you play this game for free, someone else is paying for you and when you spend $20+ on this simple game worth maybe $10, your paying for others to be able to play. This is the reality we're in now.",1
"This game is like if you took Granblue Fantasy and gave it engaging gameplay. Art, characters, story, soundtrack, and gameplay are all top notch for a mobile game.",5
Just has that free to play but better pay to play vibe.,1
I'm honestly kinda shocked at the bad reviews this game is getting. I'm having a good time with this game. Haven't had any issues. I know it's a gacha game and has a stamina system but most mobile games do. The story is actually keeping my attention and the controls are snappy and easy to get used to. There's also alot of lore about the characters and alot of things to do. I'm impressed so far.,5
Downloaded but doesnt work on pixel 2 xl just a white screen,1
The only mobile game besides Pokémon GO that has truly gripped me. Excellent visual and music design and legitimately fun action RPG gameplay make this stand out from other gacha games.,5
Best game out right now,5
It won't let me get into the group play tutorials,3
Amazing!!#!!!!!!,5
I actually like the game but the movement controls are a bit confusing. Can you go for the good old fashioned joystick controls? I'd appreciate it.,4
It would be a great game to me... if I could play it. Many players such as I are stuck in an infinite loading screen on the coop tutorial. And yet they have taken 2 days and still no update to fix this. Absolutely livid.,2
No kid o. Will digh,1
Unable to get past broken co-op forced tutorial. Room creation hangs. Uninstall reinstall did not fix. Won't be playing.,1
I waited for this game with my friends. At first you get what you have seen from the videos online. Then you realize it gets too repetitive. The worst feature of all is the gacha. The concept of gacha is trying to pull good stuff from a load. Dragalia has horrendous rates in the gacha. I have been playing the game for more than a day now and I have never acquired a 5 star after getting a guaranteed one from the first pull. I spent thousands of gems for pulls that are absolutely horrific. I acquired the gems through grinding tremendously. My team has fallen power and the game gets really boring by then. True I can level them up but seriously it just adds like 4 might. What a joke. If I don't get a 5 star by tomorrow I will 100% delete the game. Waste of time honestly. Huge disappointment Nintendo should have just updated Pokemon Quest.,1
"I'm very pleased with this game. I actually kind of enjoy the story (but my standards are low since mobile JRPGs typically have garbage storylines). The gacha rates start pretty bad, but get better with each roll without 5 star units. I might get 0 5 stars for 2 11 rolls and end up with 4 5 stars in the next. So, it seems the rates skyrocket. No problem at all with getting good units. My only complaint is the sort of odd control scheme. Charge attacks, which are necessary for breaking shields, are clunky and don't register input quickly. Actual movement controls are also kind of weird. Sometimes the dpad will move even if I didn't remove my finger from the screen. Co-op is also highly encouraged with the potential to get 2500 wyrmstones (50 stones per new player), and clearing content becomes easier with co-op as well.",5
Great polish and lots of stuff to do. The music is insanely good. A fantastic experience overall.,5
Grinding fest mania,5
It asks you to download every single stage before you start it. I mean it's 2018 how is this a thing?,1
Fun,5
Lots of fun with co-op!,5
For a dungeon crawler like game the movement controls are very akward and not very practical. And a big minus is that you can only play in vertical and cant screen rotate and play horizantal,2
"Way too cluttered UI, makes everything look like a bad Facebook game. The forced tutorial is painful. The controls are okay and the gameplay is basic. The choice to skip the involved story is good, but sort of defeats one main purpose of the game. Feels gimmicky, not Nintendoesque.",2
Game keeps freezing and controls r bad need to fix how they walk or should have an auto targeting when atacking cuz the walking is kinda crapy needs to defiantly be redone,3
Loved it. I'm in to these types of games.,5
Really fun game so far. Loving the story and music,5
"Dragalia has not let me down! Music is great, game play is smooth, graphic are appealing, and there's even a story with cut scenes. This game sets itself way apart from anything I've played on mobile before.",5
"The game is cool but, I think all the things you need to download should be downloaded at the begining of the game.",5
All the characters are unique in their own ways jyst like Nintendo usually does it. There's just a fresh feeling with thus game. I recommend!,5
"One of the best games available right now..don't let the ratings decieve you.The controls are a bit clunky which is something to be desired but still you will fell in love with this game for the music,animation and characters.",5
I got a 5-star fire dragon in the first hour so I can't complain too much I guess,5
"Stuck in the tutorial mode.. it makes me click Co-OP, then I have to click on Create A Room, then it sits, using data nonstop, but never does anything even if you wait 5 or more mins. Everytime I restart the game I end up in the tutorial mode and get stuck again trying to create a room",3
This game is proof Nintendo can make good games for mobile,5
It's awsome fooooooool,5
I love Turing into a dragon,5
Its good,5
9/10 game,5
Chapter 1 was fine but this game gets way to hard in chapter 2. I dont know why they turned up the hardness in chapter 2. The controlls were horrible as well. I dont like extra hard games all of a sudden. Definitely I dont recommend.,2
There are to many downloads to deal with and they take to long,4
Can't even play cause of the constant downloads and errors while also not being able to to have any other apps because it takes up too much space. Maybe next time allow people to move it to an SD card and let it run from there. 0/10 uninstalling right away,1
Pretty fun,4
"The controls suck, and it always crashes when I do a summon. I was looking very forward to this game to come out. Then I find it trash. Very disappointed.",3
"Not your average rpg and worth playing. You aren't going to get stronger if you buy gems to do a bunch of 10x summons. Takes progressing through the storyline, actually doing the work, and learning the content in the game. Matchmaking is a bit different as there is stamina and a blue token scenario if you don't host the room. Check the settings and download all data (2gb) so you don't have to wait for each level to download.",5
I Love the game but I keep on getting stuck on the co op create a room menu so I can't progress any further in the story :(,3
"Worthless gacha trash, come on Nintendo you can do better than this!",1
"It would appear that when you get to chapter 2 and the game forces co-op, they didnt write an AI to take the place of no one else running the mission at that time or the game is bugged either way. I have been stuck load a room 4 times now for 5 mins plus each time. Otherwise the game seems fun and well written.",3
Can someone please explain to me why the summon rates are so bad? I keep getting nothing but 3 stars with every pull I make.,3
"Was hoping for a good old Action JRPG. Sadly disappointed. You get maybe 2 minutes of gameplay over the first 2 hours of downloads, tutorials and storyline... I dont have time for this type of game apparently.",1
This is a phenomenal gacha game,5
Its different from the other games. The graphics is good. It has a good story to get into to start out.,5
"This game Is AMAZING, I'm just not able to go any further in the game because the game wont load when I hit the CO-OP feature in the tutorial, PLEASE FIX, I have a samsung s8",5
"Game looks nice but rates are trash. You have to start by DLing 1.25g worth of data. Then you play through 2 mins of tutorial to get another data download. Then you get a free trash 4* pull. You start with 2 multis which is nice but good luck getting a 5* anything. They have Cards, Dragons and Units ALL on the same banner. So your odds of actually starting with anything good is horrible. Give the game a lite version dl to start with and split units, dragons and cards into different banners and maybe this game could be good. But as it stands other gacha games are far better than this one.",1
"Great game, great story and awesome gameplay, rate or drop of higher star are quite low but Don't matter much for me",5
When I create a room it never stops loading,4
The title scene is to loong,1
Great,5
Waaaaay to long of a story before you have any game play. Have to download more data for each quest. Then more story then 5 second play then more story then download then more story. Rinse and repeat.,2
It's a good game but the app it huge and I mean really huge,4
reset game 4 times a total of 5hrs but got 2 5 stars,4
I want to play this game but.. It requires lots of space... so...,1
It is really good,5
Poor controls and combat,2
"I like the game so far, and I want to play more of it, but I can't get past the tutorial for co-op. The loading fairy just dances in the corner and i can't seem to do a thing about it, so I can't get past it and play more while my friends get ahead of me enjoying the game.",4
Gives short bursts of fun gameplay. A little simplistic and the difficulty lies mostly in how much power your team has. But a fun short term game.,4
"You can download the rest of the files (so you don't download 2mb every other quest) in the options menu. Anyway, great game so far.",5
"Stuck at the ""Avenue to Power"" mission, the game will not allow me to create a room therefore the game is now unplayable as this is a required step in the story mission.",3
"Its is very polished and refinded game that leaps into the journey of gacha game with a interesting style. Its good, the only problem i have with it is the controls. Is there way they can make a circle pad or some other form of controlling caharcter movement",5
Its good thats all.,5
Just the look and feel of this game makes me want more I know it's new but I can't wait to drowned some serious game time!,5
"good game, you can choose to install th whole game or download little bits which is nice on my memory ;p. i would enjoy landscape mode and for the movement to be with a pad but that more of a QOL thing. the game story is cool and i love dragons so this game is win from me",5
好き,5
Nice.,5
The tutorial is bugged,1
"The dislike was never my concerning, but I don't understand why there's so much dislike",5
"the walking/control movements are really wonky, sometimes when i move my thumb even a little i'll start going the wrong way. it's enough of a pain for me to take away a star; otherwise, i'm really enjoying the game so far!",4
"Unable to play game. Open app up and screen goes black. After about 10 seconds, the app populates a message that says ""This device is not authorized to play the game"". Note that this is a message screen from within the app and not a notification message. Once populated, seems to be no way past other that to close app.",1
"Fighting mechanism is strange. Your attacks won't always hit because you're swinging randomly. No Nintendo charm, seems like any other game.",2
"Really enjoying this so far. I've been playing it non stop since release and I'm in love with the characters. It doesn't really feel like you need a 5* character because a lot of the 4* characters are really good, and even some of the 3* ones have potential. The game also gives you a lot of stuff to help you as you progress through the story.",5
"Great Game, But it takes up too much storage, Don't play while using data! Other than that I love the game (Edit) Rewards are too good.",4
not enjoyable,1
Its fun to play but the thing I really hate is that there is a bug when I am trying to host a coop lobby or search to one it just freezes my screen and its starting to get annoying. CAN YOU PLEASE FIX THIS!! I WANT TO PLAY COOP!!,4
"This game is pretty wonderful. Everyone complains about gacha, but the drop rates are much higher than I've seen in other games ( I've seen .02% in other games more times than I can count). Gameplay is solid, there's top tier voice acting, the story is engaging, and I personally find the gacha system very rewarding. I am F2P, and have a full team of 4 stars, some with 5 star dragons or cards. If you want the best characters and the best gear as soon as you start playing, you're just a sad product of our current society. 10/10, very happy with the game, in its entirety.",5
AaaAAAAAAAA,5
"Was having fun until I hit a road block in Ch 2 for the tutorial for avenue of power. I followed the game prompts and the game is stuck in perpetual loading. If you close the app and reopen, it takes you right back there. Nintendo is typically known for it's quality but I'm disappointed to see so many issues with this game. They should have spent more time doing QC and debugging. I hope a fix comes soon, or I'm uninstalling",1
Love the game but it stuck on the co OP mission where you create a room. Does not seem to get past the loading screen,5
"Nintendo has done it again! This Gem of a game is soo perfect and beautiful, that I have no words to describe it... you just have to play it to see what I mean",5
Encompasses all the top games into one. Very nice!,5
Forced co-op? Uninstalling.,1
I tried installing this & it takes WAY TOO LONG! I even used Wi-Fi which was @ 100% connectivity & still was waiting for over 10 minutes just to get to try it..no luck!! The graphics while downloading were fantastic but I have no clue how goid or crappy the game us where I'm not going to wait forever just to play something!!!,1
i love it😍,5
Boring,2
"Just another overly-complicated action rpg. Got bored the first half hour. I expected something different. I like what nintendo has done since the release of the switch, but o think they dropped the ball on this one.",2
Cool,5
"Game is unavailable in Finland so i cant play with some of my friends,that's a quick uninstall, makes no sense to have region locked games still",3
"""This device is not authoized to play this game"" gj",1
It's a really good game ignore all the butthurt reviews they're only complaining about stupid stuff,5
This game sucks bad graphics like all the other games and the 3D models of the character really bad as hell...,1
Still needs alot of updates to optimized properly. Too many bugs.,3
"抄白貓project, 畫風也比白貓project 差",2
"Love the characters and the art style! The voice acting is also very nice. The controls are a little sensitive and take a little while to get used to, but besides that, I'm completely in love. (P.S. for the people having problems with the download every game go into settings and download everything)",5
I've liked what I've seen so far. The constant prompt to data download was annoying at first I will be honest. This game is a nice distaction. The gacha rates don't bother me that much.,5
I can not get in the servers when I open the game it say fail to connect to servers I been waiting to play sense it was announced please fix I will change my review when it is fixed sorry.,1
Game will not open up. Samsung galaxy s8+.,1
"Graphics: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Story 11/10 by far one of my favorite games for mobile, this game deserves to be in a top 10 something because its great!!! My only issue is the controls, yes, there easy to use, just a bit jerky, maybe add like and adjustable analog stick where you can place wherever on the screen and change the size? I don't know, but that's my only complaint for this game, keep up the great work Nintendo and CYgames!!!",5
"Would not work, dowloaded the game and additional files, then was told I needed to download more additional files (it's normal to have a patch early in release of a game), but every time I tried to download them it told me it couldn't connect even though my connection hadn't changed",1
Gr8,5
Its perdy goot,4
"The story is trite, boring, and the main character has that oh so overdone misplaced valor that translates to misogyny. You have to download before every bit of story and every bit of gameplay. It's constant, and it's annoying. I expected more out of a title with a Nintendo logo, but I was sorely disappointed.",1
"Stuck in co-op tutorial loop, as it makes me go through it when I log in then I get stuck on a loading screen for the create a party co-op, this makes the game unplayable, I am connected to wifi, so my internet isn't a problem, please address this",1
"Cygames has yet to let me down! Another fantastic game! It remindes me of Breath of Fire and Legend of Dragoon. The only thing is I wish the movement button was a little more streamlined. It's slightly difficult to control the character. Other than that, I'm so far impressed!",5
"The game overall is great! Out of the gacha games I've played, by mechanics alone, this stands above most of them. The rates for a 5 star characters are in between FE heroes and FGO, which is doable. The biggest problem with this game is the mere size of the game. After playing all of my side characters' stories and making it to chapter 3, the game reaches above 2.5 GB of data. This is a problem for anyone that plays other games or is already having data storage problems, especially since the game requires all except the voices to be downloaded to be even played. Otherwise, a great game. If you have around 5 GB of storage available, go ahead and play. I can't recommend this enough.",4
I like it so far.,5
Game got stuck in an endless loading screen when trying to go through the co-op tutorial while creating a room.,1
Why does this feel like every other similar rpg on the market? I mean literally nothing different. Has a Nintendo logo but still another google rpg.,1
"I got to say this people out did it with this game, and for the people. Having problems must me because you are running the game on a device. That has a low RP this game you will need a RP of 350 to run this game perfectly.",5
Great game and I welcome the newest Nintendo characters,5
"Besides the very excessive amount of downloads, it's a great game!",5
Its ok,5
During chapter 2 it forces you to play a co-op event but it never loads and every time you close and open the game it does the same,5
Fun game,4
"If you are using Samsung disable battery saving to play. If you want to download everything at once instead of at each level go to setting > system > batch download. I enjoy the game, combat is fun, graphics are cute but good and the music is great. It's a Gacha game so expect to not get the summons you want, but still fun.",4
"Very cute animation. I'm only in chapter two so far. I do hate the constant downloads, even after the batch download. Also, pixel 2 running pie, I've had a lot of errors since downloading so that sucks. Most likely memory based (I have a lot of games so not going to just blame this one).",4
"Two names in the game industry I didnt expect to see together, but openly welcome. Love them both, and extremely pleased with Daoko on the vocals. Most complaints I see are people who may not be used to cygames style gacha games. I hope to see the gameplay be a little more polished up in the future, and perhaps a quicker menu system, but that's asking for a bit much. Great app, cant wait to lose sleep over it.",5
It has a lot of fps(lag) when loading the chunks,4
"It's fun and lot of adventure, but sometimes the game crashes during the story and makes me mad, plz fixed that. And also fix the movement control for the chapter, cause sometimes it slides to the opposite then I want it 2",4
"Gives an Xenoblade-esque vibe to it, but with Gacha.",5
跟白貓同一模式，但操作起來卻不太順，不論是點選介面或是戰鬥，loading時間有點長，唯一比較好是支援中文吧~ 😂,3
"Rates are a joke. Launch celebration and you have your rates this bad? Laughable. Gameplay gets a solid 4 for me, the dodge is wacky, maybe add i-frames if there aren't any already?",4
Connect to server errors,1
The app keeps shutting off,5
Same old free to play garbage with tickets and orbs to summon. Ridiculous cartoon scantily clad women. C'mon Nintendo. Real games please.,2
"Super grindy gacha game, if it's what you're looking for then here we are",5
while i like this game for as long as i could play it i have gotten to the point where you can start doing events im now being forced to make an co op room to the event however i just get the pixie loading sprite. i have tried for 10 minutes to get pass this (5 mins on wifi 5 mins on data),2
"Pretty solid, free game that had a lot more effort put into it than I expected.",5
"Needs a lot of space and keeps needing more so for me, unplayable. Great game otherwise, it seems from what little I've played before running out of space",4
"Fun, but buggy. Ive lost 1 or 2 ""Tenfold summons"" it summons the cards but when I go into my team none of the characters are there! I closed and restarted still not there. Controls are a little wonky, jumps sometimes, when near the edge of the screen it can sorely hurt an intense battle",3
"Stuck on Ch 2 when you're supposed to do a co-op session for the first time. Instead, it just tries loading in for 10 mins until I eventually give up and have to close out of it. Will re-do the review when this gets fixed.",2
Nintendo deleted my last rating. The game is extremely generic in both story and gameplay and the gacha rates are terrible.,1
This is like granblue fantasy little brother,5
I dont like the constant downloeds but other than that a veary fun game,5
"this game has many additional downloads after the initial one, the controls are too loose, and the combat doesn't work well. you should be able to attack in the direction you tap, but you can't. additionally, you move by dragging across the screen, but it keeps moving the base of the arrow even if you don't lift your finger.",1
Too glitchy right now. I'll download again later on. Crashes during summoning and boss fights.,2
Really fun,5
"Welp, I played the first 5 minutes of the game and I'm going to give you my take as a ordinary everyday type of gamer. I loved the machanics of how the AI moved about. Graphics where very clean/crisp and smooth. Sound was great on my galaxy using both my phone speakers or my headphones. In my opinion, what didnt seek me to play more was the absence of final fantasy type of bosses or magic spells.. I dunno, guess I was expecting something more on my end as far as character to environment interaction. Just needs more in my opinion. All in all...good game..give it a try.",3
It's an awesome game with great story,5
Excellent game. I expected nothing less from Nintendo. I love it,5
"This game is one of the best on the play store. Alot of people said it been glitchy for them or crashes on them a lot. I am playing at highest graphic settings on an LG V20 and have had no issues. Also some say they hit a wall where they feel they need to pay to continue. The only time I got a little hung up was back in chapter two. All I had to do was do two great summons (easily had enough rainbow stones or whatever they are to do this. I have not spent a dime on this game) and then level up a wind type team to take on the water type enemies. Half of them are 3 stars so ya they dont give you a five star summon every time but what game does? I have followed this pattern of making sure my hero's are the stronger element over the enemies and still dont feel like there was any wall.(wind->water->fire) this is rated like a 4.8 or 4.9 in the apple app store so it is sad to see that apple phones are not having the issues these people are with their androids and they are also smart enough to get past this fake 'cash wall'. Come on android users, we are better than that...",5
Best. Music. Ever.,5
"Love it!! Love the music (I actually like just listening to it without even playing sometimes...and thats something I normally wouldnt do). Love the gameplay. Love the graphics. Love the story. Love that they actually combined two types of game into one (building your own land with regular hack and slash). This game is my new favorite game :)...if it does not exist yet, they should totally make an anime for this...it would be awesome :)",5
"This game is so amazing, I love the story so far and I'm happy Nintendo made this extraordinary game!",5
🎩 😁 👕👍Great! 👖,5
I'm stuck. Whenever I try to do the create a room tutorial the game goes on a endless loading screen to create the room,2
Dragon. Waifus.,5
Easily the most forgiving gacha game.,5
Beautiful & Vibrate Artsyle. Amazing OST. Truly a simple & fun game to play.,5
"It's not broken per se, but it plays horribly. Movement is clumsy and awkward, fighting is simply tapping anywhere on the screen. There's no real strategy or skill involved. If you think Pokemon Rumble is a bit too hard, you'll enjoy this game.",2
"Dragalia Lost... more like Downloadia Lost. Seriously this game starts out with a 1.5 GB patch and then proceeds to gate itself with several other downloads throughout. Most of which seem to just lose connectivity to the server despite having full signal where I'm at (right next to the router). Idk if this game is good or not, I haven't downloaded enough to get to that part.",3
There a download all option hidden in the menus.,5
Decent game great art and character design music is awsome would be be better if was able to play in landscape mode and tweak controls I like games where you can collect ALOT of characters il see when the updates and events roll out down the road,3
Excellent game but it froze when I got to the event tab.,5
Nintendo and cygames come togther to make a really nice looking and feeling game.,5
Nice,5
Stupid the game lags to much,1
"Very great game..... but for me, the game doesn't work after the cpu coop because after I click the level, it just shows Notte forever. I stayed in this screen for like 10 minutes until I knew it didn't work for me. Please Nintendo, fix this error.",5
"Could a developer please help me out. I had accidentally deleted the app and reinstalled the app and when I got in the game, it said authentication failed and I have no way of playing the game now. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it again but it still does not work. I have not linked my Nintendo account yet.",1
Bad control,2
this is one of few game that can made me push story mode non stop. story are really great .i like how they give us character we meet in story too.while there is still few bugs i am sure it will get fix in near future .control are a little hard to adjust but it ok. and u can get main currency for summon quite easy. while drop rate are quite low i like it,5
The game is great overall but the people who keep complain about always downloading each quest you can just go to settings and click download settings and just download everything at once with or without voices,5
Really fun game when you're not waiting for it to download more and more data every quest. It's a shame. Had to uninstall before it was too late.,2
"I am permanently stuck in a loading loop during the Co-op tutorial. The game freezes as soon as I click Create Room, and restarting the app just restarts the tutorial without giving an option to exit. I am completely unable to make progress.",3
Can't play the game. There is a major issue where some people (including myself) can't play the game because it won't connect to the servers. The game will only connect if I use my phone data but won't allow me to play on WIFI which makes playing impossible for me. It won't even let me submit feedback or help within the game and the issue has not been addressed. I would give 0 stars currently if I could.,1
"Wow. Super disappointing so far. I mean the game itself is ok, I just can never get in to play it.",2
Great game minus co op not working and constantly downloading game every level,3
"Phenomenal game! I love everything about it, except that it will not get passed the loading screen of avenue of power create a room screen. I have tried everything to get passed it but nothing. Hopefully it gets fixed so I can enjoy the game again.",4
Its got tons of updates ahead don't expect much,5
"I have just completed the first two chapters.Now,my feeling was bad,vey bad.I feel bad for this game because low drop rate,complicated summon（OML,there even have 5 tier weapon,dragon✘? ）,and awkward mobile control. OMG,every boss releases their skills without interruption,and I must keep swiping to avoid. I have been waiting for it for months,but it turns out to be disppointing. P.S you know what,0.5% drop rate；1500 balls are needed for tenfold summon,but the rewards for one chapter are less than 500. Each chapters contains up to 10 mini chapters. OMG,OMG.",2
Seems like a fun game but requires too much dl,3
"Would like to play, but I can't get past the title screen because of stupid network errors while downloading",2
Controls are clunky but has absolutely beautiful music. Gacha pull rates are very low right now. Could use a lot of improvement,4
My game won't load the co-op tutorial and now I can't play anymore because of it. Customer support still had failed to help me. If it doesn't work tomorrow I'm uninstalling.,2
"I lile the game so far, but everytime i want to makea party my game freezes i cant make a party and i cant join amyone else or thryre just not making a room for people to join.",4
"So far, loving the game. Gacha isn't too bad but wish we could pick in between weapon, dragon, and character summons. Story is the best so far. Controls are easy. However, co-op is a bit broken and lags. Hoping that gets fixed. Other from that a solid 4/5 game that puts other gacha/mobile games a bit into the dust.",4
Good,5
"This is a fun game and the design is absolutely amazing! I enjoy the characters and the music is very pretty. It is quite easy to play. However, the game is much to big for a phone game. It requires a lot of downloads. The story also moves much too quickly and it becomes overwhelming.",3
Absolutely wonderful this is the best game I've ever played!,5
Just a dumb boring game.,1
"I haven't played it yet, when I do, I will give 5 stars",3
"Love the game. Voice acting is great, the environments and even loading screens are great. If you don't like downloading every tiny bit, do a batch download :) The issue I was having has been fixed so 5/5 stars.",5
Is so cool,5
I wish I could g8ve this a higher rating. But currentlynstuck in co op tutorial that freezes loading and now can't play it at all. I know your working on it. Just advise your players don't use your tutorials and they will be fine,3
"This game runs smooth for me even with high level performance in the settings. If you're having any problems with it, it can be your device, or connection. I had no lag with the exception of when I was losing connection due to poor wifi while traveling. Gameplay feels more like a portable console instead of a mobile nostalgia from the original DS days. Gacha system is just like any other gacha games, so it don't bother me since I started the game knowing that. Small mechanics like filtering when unbinding cards or weapons make it so much easier to do then most other games, which requires you scroll through all of your collections. Music is the best I have ever heard in mobile games and possibly console level. If you love vocal and lots of Jpop you're in for a treat. Lots of voice acting even for minor characters when doing their episode stories. I had no problems with controls, just hold and slide to move and tap to attack. And slide instantly to dodge. The castle building system is a side fun activity that helps craft weapons, make money, and increase unit's stats, and with a pinch of nice decorations to how you would like your Castle town. Nintendo and Cygames clearly pour their heart into this, taking problems that plague other gacha games and refining it to what it's called Dragalia Lost.",5
I love this RPG game. It's the best.,5
"No, no, and no",1
"I really, really like this game. It's a happy medium between mobages that are too simple and mobages that feel like a 2nd job if you ever want to be good. People who are complaining about difficulty are those who are just bumrushing the story and not taking time to strengthen their parties at all. Some people are saying chapter 6 is too hard with 4.5k might. I have 4.5k might in chapter 3. The fact that people aren't taking the time to level their weapons or dragons doesn't mean that the game is too hard, it means that they are bad at mobages. My two qualms (that I don't downstar for because they're understandable for a new game) are that coop is really unstable connection wise, and the movement is still rather wonky. These are things that I believe will be fixed in time, though. Overall, it is a really fun game and definitely worth the try! It's getting a lot of hate because it's not a Fire Emblem Heroes or Granblue Fantasy clone, and apparently that's all anyone wanted from a new game. I don't know about you, but a clone of those sounds pretty boring to me.",5
Massive,5
"nice art and music. extremely grindy, made worse by long loading times. heavy grind also minimizes effect of p2w, though there is currently no competitive aspect to the game anyway. very generous with currency, you should afford 4 or 5 10-rolls before the story is done. co-op and solo run on separate stamina systems so playing a mix of both is encouraged. auto battle AI is very weak and doesn't try to avoid incoming damage. would be 5* if loading times and AI were better, as it is it's a bit of a chore to play.",4
"All the menu, story, music, and non game play mechanics are of the utmost polish. But bottom line is I got bored of playing it just within the first 2 bosses. It feels so incredibly boring. I really wanted to like it but there wasn't even a spark of interest to level the character up. I think it's because there is a feeling of disconnect between the way you interact and what the character does to the baddies. It feels empty. It's hard to describe but it just doesn't really feel like you are playing.",3
"I never write reviews for apps but holy cow this is great!! Great story, great characters, fun and engaging game play, but best of all, THE MUSIC!!!! If they sold the soundtrack to this game I would buy it in an instant!!!",5
"This isn't a bad game, but it's not working properly. Once you get a few levels into chapter 2, the game introduces co-op play. Unfortunately the game forces you to choose it and then create your own room. When I click to do that, the loading fairy in the bottom right corner dances forever, never actually creating the room. Since the game forces you to do this, I can't access anything else, including my sign in rewards or the castle to collect my stuff. So as it stands, I can't play the game. I liked chapter 1, so I hope you'll do something to fix this so I can keep playing! Playing on a LG V30 by the way",2
"Seriously, these people are so silly. They're complaining about not being OP in the beginning? Learn how to play a game for once and enjoy it for crying out loud. Stop trying to play to be the best, it's not going to happen you sad losers.",5
"So much data seems to be needed that my phone cannot handle it, would play more but now I can't.",4
KONA DIO DA,5
It says my phone is not authorized,1
It's great game I like the controls only this is wish it would go full screen for the Galaxy S9+ I mean it does work but notification bar stays on,4
Its a good game,5
Not bad at all. Still hate Nintendo tho,5
I can't launch it...,4
"Pros: BGMs are very nice! Cons: Gameplay feels sluggish, story is kinda generic, gatcha rates are quite bad.",2
IT IS PERFECT OMG NINTENDO! ALL OF MY FRIENDS PLAY THIS! I have just one suggestion. Could u plz put a circle pad in place of arrow movement? It would make combat so much easier!,5
Great game but needs some bug's to be fixed.,4
"I really do enjoy game. But the controls throw me off. I wish they were more like a joystick control, because being in battle and trying to move away from strike zones to only dart the opposite way sucks. Also, don't know if it's more so my device, but it runs slow and takes a few clicks to get around. Giving it 4 stars and going to uninstall. I'll come back in a few months to see if any good updates happened.",4
I can not access the game because it keeps givings me the message saying the source code for the game needs to be extracted. That's another game I'm never touching unless there is an update,1
"Very fun game, good graphics, a interesting story, and the gacha system is not so bad.",5
Another Nintendo Gem,5
App cant install error code -506. Will give better review upon actually being able to install/play the game.,1
It's a really cool game! It runs perfectly fine for me and the gameplay is fun!,5
"For some reason, the game was only showing siloulettes of the characters. I couldn't see the 3D models of the characters is what I mean. Controls are okay. Everything else looks and sounds fantastic.",3
"Gacha cash grab anyone? The chance for a 5* anything is 0.5%. Now that is just for a 5*, which that five star can be a character, dragon or fancy card thing. So, let's say you want a 5* character you can use? It's even less than that 0.5% chance to get one. To put it into perspective, Fate Grand order has better drop chances, which if you have played it before, you know those chances are pitiful also (or rngesus hates me a lot, which is true for fgo). Honestly, there are better p2w gacha games out there, and that's saying something.",1
:D,5
Berry cool,5
Must play! Amazing game,5
"This game brings me back to one of my favorite mobile games ever, Tales of the Rays. While there are a few improvements that can be had, it has mainly kept me interested because I actually get to fight instead of just waiting to press a button like in most other gacha games. I love the story, and am really happy with all the different things that can be done. If I could offer a suggestion, make costumes a thing that we can get for characters, and make them interchangeable between other characters.",5
Love the music and the story,5
Another derivative Gacha whale hunter,1
"This game is by far among one of the best games I've played and overall well valanced between gameplay and aesthetics. It definitely has a unique feel to it and I highly suggest trying it out! Since this is a gacha game, the rates are pretty fair as well when conpared to various other gacha games.",5
I expect more from Nintendo it's just a cash grab.,1
Game was amazing up till the co-op mission where it now freezes and can't progress anything un game because it is a required mission.,2
"Downloaded it, then it had another 2gb download. It got to 0.01mb left to download and kept giving me a network error. Also, not giving me the option to turn off the music at the very beginning before that extra download was annoying.",1
It's super fun,5
Can we get an auto button or landscape with joystick so that movement is more smooth,5
"I wish I could give this game 4.5, as it's quite good, but there is enough to prevent a 5. On the one hand, the graphics, gameplay, music and voice acting are all top notch. New features are added as the story progresses, the characters all have personality and backstories to explore, and the controls are mostly good (minor directional quirks when attacking to get used to). All of this makes for a game worth checking out. On the other hand, besides the unacceptably terrible gacha rates and the shared pool between 3 card types limiting a ""desired"" roll of the dice to hours of rerolling when starting out, there are a lot of currencies to collect, sort through and keep track of, which can bog down ones enjoyment when you'd rather just burn your stamina and then go about your day. On top of that, wyrmprints and especially dragons need almost as much care put into them as the characters themselves! If future events aren't particularly generous with ""welfare"" units and such, it could make things bleak when endgame content becomes more challenging. Overall though, the game's start is solid, especially for a brand new IP. It will be up to the game developers to hold our attention going forward.",4
"I signed up, pre-registered through the app store and downloaded this game as soon as I was indicated that I should be able to. It's not available/working for my device (HTC One). I'll leave a better, or at least more thorough review as soon as it is.",1
Not even a 1 percent drop rate on 5 star adventure characters meaning either spend money to get them or be the luckiest person on the planet.,1
Why cant it work😡😠😕😑😐😱😵😲😭😖🙅😾💩,5
The summon rates are even WORSE than Fate/Grand order l which i didn't think was possible.,2
"cute game, but buggy. first time i played, after i almost finished the tutorial, i had a lot of ""GUIDE_MESSAGE_102_101"" nonsense show up instead of game text. today, i died, and then turned into a dragon, and was just frozen in place, presumably because i'm not supposed to be able to transform after my death. sometimes, if you turn the screen off for a moment, and then turn it back on, the game screen is just black.",4
"This game is a really fun time waster, can definitely see myself getting lost in the story.",5
Way too many teenage girls running around in lingerie. Why is this always the case with anime?,1
Really great graphics and character designs,5
Good,5
Great game Co-op events freezes on my device (note 8) plz fix it but otherwise it's a very solid game.,4
"One word ""Nintendo"" Since its the number 1 gaming company. It makes great games",5
Great game anyone who is complaining about gacha has never played mobile games and this is not even money hungry like other games,5
So far I can't put this game down.. loving it!,5
This game was very very unfun the story was kind of bland I expected more from this to be honest,3
Awesome game,5
Its so far good untill i dind something wrong with it then its fabulous or untill i get bored ......,5
"I played this game till chatper 4 to review this game. This game feels like any other gacha mobile game on the market, it just runs under the Nintendo banner without any of the polishes that the usual Nintendo games have. The game is isn't very responsive, especially when it comes to controls. Auto battle is more effective than manual controls, also the amount of data-space this game takes is way too large for the scope it has accomplished. It is one of the games that degrade what I thought Nintendo is known for, QUALITY GAMES. Edit PS: I hope most of you like voice acting, because it disappears as you venture further in the game.",3
The game keeps crashing or giving me authentication error but i will keep working on it and when it works i'll change my rating,2
The graphics are awesome storie is pretty good just too much loading time and I have a feeling that you will eventually spend a lot of money in this game if it wasn't for the loading time I would give it 5 stars,4
"Reached a point in the game where it requires co-op, but co-op doesn't work and freezes every time I try to create a room. Cannot access any other portion of the game, including settings. Gameplay up until this was fun, even though this is a blatant rip-off of Colopl's Rune Story game that shut down a few years ago. Wish I could actually play, kinda expected more from Nintendo in terms of polish on the game.",1
I cant even to the co op event its showing me how to do it but as soon as i click find a game on co opit just keeps loding so now i cant even move any further in the game,2
"Couldn't even play this, downloaded the 1.5GB and encountered the network error, returned the title to have to download .01MB just to instantly see the same error again. Would like to play this but I don't know what's going on.",2
Hmmm im still mad at u fix the online thing but I'm gonna try this out .,5
Great,5
Love it,5
A game that is fun to play. It has great art direction and fun mechanics to keep you coming back. Always have something to do daily. Love this game.,5
"This game is a pretty standard one, and I like the basic outline. I just cants stand the amount of loading. You have to load each level twice--once for the cutscenes and once for the level itself--and it's just so annoying I can't play it. The controls are wonky and hard to use and there is no autoplay to make up for it.",2
"theres a bug with the coop tutorial that locks you out of playing the game entirely. incredibly disappointing to have such a massive bug so early in the game, and for it not to be patched immediately",1
I wish I could play the game but I can't even get past the set up. My phone kept crashing.,1
Great graphics. Exactly the same as any other game. Just more gatchas. I hope one day they will make a real game,1
"Have to give it this review, stops downloading at 99.97% and won't finish.",1
Feels like a great time to start your adventure.,5
I love the music and the graphic is awesome,5
please support chromebook im begging you,3
"Great game. However, for some reason, my wyrmite is stuck on 25 and I can't collect more. No matter how much wyrmite I collect in the story, my total still says 25. Anyway I can fix this?",4
Sweet,5
"I love the game but for some reason it wont let me run it on my wifi, only data. Does anyone else have this issue?",3
This is not a mobile game... Unless you have unlimited data plan don't bother. Download the game on wifi then Download the 1.5g after install no problem.... The issues is every level u play while out and about on mobile data the game wants to make u download 1mb - 3mb each level each and every level!!! Just let me download the game in full!,1
Poor down rate for 5 stars.,1
Poorly optimized. Game stuck at creating a coop room. App run slow and clunky.,3
"I don't understand I intall the game and open it up. Then when I tap to play on the title screen showing that's loading a message pops up saying ""your device is unauthorized to play"". Please help I really want to try this game out! Please, and thank you!",1
"Controls are way too jumpy. And I'd love to just have everything downloaded from the start instead of having to download new files at every turn. Otherwise, it's kinda charming.",3
Loved it until I realized that I didn't have a high enough credit rating to p(l)ay the game.,5
"A gacha game at heart, though this one has a well done formula.",5
"Really nice game with really nice graphics! When I played this game, it felt familiar for some reason as if I was playing other anime rpg games. Though I liked it, the controls seem to be a little clunky but, a few fixes can be good! In addition, I'm having trouble creating a room for some reason. When I create a room in co-op, i seem to get stuck for a while loading up. With being stuck on the tutorial for making a room in co-op, I can't move on in the game. Can someone help? Thank you!",5
"So. Gorgeous game and the game mechanics aren't bad. This game deserves so much credit, but my problem is that the control scheme is all over the place, literally. If I try turning the direction I'm heading, if the arrow touches the edge of the screen, it jumps and sends me wherever it decided. The dash and attack is fine, but the arrow for movement works very poorly, not to mention if I want to slow down and thus move my finger back down on the arrow, it resets every time and sends me full sprint the other way. If there was a pseudo joystick control option like in other games, I feel it would help the gameplay. Other wise, this game isn't worth putting money into, and I might uninstall soon and keep looking for a decent RPG game.",3
This the definition of p2w,1
"The controller is buggy, lag, and delay.so many conversations which makes it boring.",2
"Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great story",5
I enjoy this game so far but I can't play it anymore due to the coop tutorial to create a room and putting me on an endless load,1
Nice one reggie,5
"Terrible controls, too many loading screens. Ok graphics. 2/10.",1
The game is getting stuck on the co-op tutorial,5
"It has a lot of polish, but the actual gameplay is incredibly boring.",3
"It was too good to be true to be a 100 mb game. It's a 1.5 GB game, but you get pranked in the app store.",1
Good game lack of control to the game in combat,3
This game is real fun to play I say it also nice f2p for those who not spending money on the games not only that any hero can also can go to a 5* unit so using any kind of unit is good plus the game also have that Granblue Fantasy style where you grinding for weapons which seem important as well. I love the art work on the game it very nice artwork as well I hope other players have fun on this game and good luck.,5
"This game is what I had hoped most mobile RPGs were gonna be, but it does it better!",5
"People leaving reviews like ""You cant get far unless you pay up"" goes to show they have not invested much time in the game. The game does not cater to whales and is quite generous to f2p players. Tip: Don't spend your Wyrmite on single pulls. Save them for the 10 fold pulls. You have way better chances for those 5*",5
movement needs to be improved,3
Its great for a gacha game,5
Very fun game. Played a lot of gacha style games and this one looks great compared to others. Cygames and Nintendo know their stuff. Could see myself playing this for a long time.,5
Interesting gameplay and very high production value. Fantastic OST!  I don't understand why people are complaining this is a gacha game.. This is like going into a Japanese restaurant and complaining they serve Japanese food.,5
"The dragging aspect of the game as controls arent that great. Every time you start sprinting, it relocates the starting point of the control. When you go for the co-op tutorial, it keeps on loading the level. I was kept 2 hours on that loop. And it's probably because of my phone, but on battles and sometime the menu, it takes a while to load and lags. Besides that. Graphics are good and the story it's pretty intriguing. I like the designs for the characters and dragons. The items or cards could use a bit more of description.",3
"The game offers quite a lot. The quests (although fairly short) offer a lot of action. The difficulty may seem laughable at 1st, but once you start reaching heights such as lvl 20+ the game really does a 180 on you. Grinding in the game seems challenging, but it's not rip your hair out extremes. The story is really cheesy, but unique. All in all, a game that's definitely worth its merit.",4
"Nintendo has outdone themselves with a stellar game that raises the bar for mobile gaming. Visuals and backgrounds are gorgeous. Music is phenomenal. Story is very interesting. There's plenty to do with your own castle, upgrading different elements/units of the game, online co-op and so on. My only complaint so far is with controls. Sometimes I'm pressing the screen to do a force break attack and the character just walks off, instead of charging for the force break attack.",4
It's above average for a GACHA game but the advertising was too main stream I guess because it attracted people who don't have experience with Gacha games and their rates so they giving the game a bad review because they choose to sit down and reroll for multiple hours hoping for a 5* that apparently gonna carry them through the game ???,5
"All around this game is great, it has a very good story, good graphics and runs smoothly. The controls take a while getting used to but they aren't that bad.",5
I was going to give it a 5 star rating until I somehow found myself unable to continue. When it forces you to create a room for online play I can go no further. Please fix so that I can change my rating on the game.,1
Wont fet past the inotial download screen. It keeps saying theres a network error,1
best mobile game I have ever played,5
I like it and its fun but for every single mission you have to download and i mean every single thing you do other then that its a cute game.,4
"The game is perfect aside from the god awful rates. If you could improve those, that would be great",5
it's a great idea except I have been stuck at the create a room tab for a a day now and it would not let me skip. Forcing me to stay on the forever loading screen.,3
Great game but what's the deal with the 20 min download time on 1.5gb,5
Good game controls are simple and the voice and all around visual presentation are good music is great to,5
Really love this game! Good job Nintendo,5
Excellent. 9.5/10,5
"Overall a great game with stunning graphics! I have had many issues with the directional controls but nothing that takes too much from the game. Where I'm having the most issues is with the game freezing during the tutorial for the co-op and being unable to move forward. I have reached out to support and hopefully I will have a fix soon. Otherwise, my only other constructive criticism is the gatcha system needs a bit of work. Great game I'm hoping to be back to playing soon.",3
Simply gorgeous; a great pocket sized RPG!,5
So far this game is pretty awesome. I love the upbeat music and the playful art style. The character are well voiced and the game play is in small segments so you can still made progress without having to invest 20 or more minutes at a time outside of the intro. This is nice fur this of us that only have 5 minutes here and there.,5
"I love it, but after a day it started saying ""failure to aquire data"" whenever I want to start a mission or do coop or look at friend list. Needs a fix, I know others with this problem",1
Love the game but plzzz fix the stuck loading screen in co-op apparently and a few freinds on IOS it works perfectly fine.,4
This game is really fun to play and the story line is really good as well. I'm sorry that if some people don't think they can beat or play the game without spending any cash. I do it. And I'm having fun doing it too.,3
"Ehh... It's a gatcha rpg, but at least it's enjoyable and better quality than most. Not sure I expected anything less, we'll have to see how bad the paywall is down the line.",5
"I like it so far. Seems like they are trying a bit too early with coop though. Every time I search or try to create a group, it leaves me in a loading screen until I reset the game",3
"I'll tell ya what, Dragalia Lost is an excellent gacha venture. You'll see low star reviews complain about the difficulty, but that's literally what the Road to Power missions are for: you gotta grind. The music is fantastic, the story and voice acting are top notch, and the art style and graphics are both excellent. The only downside are low pull rates, but even then, you get by. Game is 9.5/10 for me.",5
Love all things expect the fact the high character rates are like 0.00% and I did two 10 summons and got one five star but it was a card NOT EVEN HERO also its very hard to control your character for some reason...please increase the high character rates or even just the character rates them selves....NINtENdo,4
Nothing wrong with a gatcha game done right.,5
I think its an amazing game all around. Been playing since servers went live. Everything is so polished and high quality. I love it!,5
Best,5
it's a good game,5
I love it I don't care what people say about the game. It's pretty neat though.,5
Great gatcha game. Love controls and story.,5
I'm really surprised at how cool this game is. Great graphics especially on phone like the note 9. You can choose between good better and best for the graphics depending on your phone. It takes a good chunk of data though. Just started but I think I will enjoy it.,5
"Quick tutorial, great summon rate, incredible gameplay and a flawless online co-op",5
I do not understand why it's rate so low... they give free money to pull units. I already pulled like 60units. Game play is fun... not those auto and I do something else game. Units are attractive. Very well made,5
"Is a bit slow overall, lags a lot.",4
Every character 3d model is black/shadow .,1
"Great game, definitely worth downloading",5
Game is broken can not continue after co-op room tutorial,1
This is a very fun game I have no qualms with it and a message to those that do have issues with this game make your own. Sure you have difficulties in missions sometimes but that what makes a rpg just lvl up a bit more and upgrade your gear and if that doesn't work go coop. Thanks you for this wonderful game and keep it up don't focus on the bad comments focus on the good points and keep going forward!,5
"I tried to be scum and summon a 5 star, so I reset my data. Now game says error returning to main menu every time I try logging in.",1
Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeah Nintendo game is awesome,5
Awesime I love it so much except for the glitch rn hopefully it gets fixed but other than that awesome,5
Buggy game. Has a brick wall once you get to 2-1,1
"Fun game so far, the character movement is a bit wonky with the touch control.",5
"Great graphics and storyline. Same gacha system which isn't bad but game keeps freezing for some reason. Freezes at the home screen, loading screen or downloading screen and had to restart the phone the fifth time now. Wish it could be fixed so I could play more.",3
Dragalia is full of intermittent downloads.,1
Nintendo back at it with a bomb game. One complant is the controller thing is awful. A joy pad would be great.,5
Co-op,1
"Game is pretty lack luster, the graphics are good but not worth the 2gb the game eats up. Story is bland as are the characters, if you played any other arpg (or even just a rpg in general) then you already know how it goes",1
It is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen before thanks,5
"Yeah, it's a mobile gacha game, but it's a really good one!",5
Wow look at all the microtransactions. Appalling.,1
Just finished chapter 1 and so far I'm digging it. Doesn't seem like the most intense arpg but good casual fun with some nice visuals and music. Hopefully the F2P/pay to win model doesn't get horrendously apparent later on because that would be a real shame.,4
"Pissed me off before I even got out of chapter 1. So many horrible plot elements, but the one that took the cake was the paladyn. We encounter you being chased by an assasin, yet you wont divulge WHY!! The you ask to accompany us, and we agree without making you tell us information that may endanger us now that we travel with you... If the game didn't force her on me and allowed me to dismiss her this would have gotten 4 stars.",1
Amazing game loving it,5
"The gameplay and story are great, but the Co-Op Create a Room tutorial is broken, and never fully loads. Please fix this, because now that I have accepted the tutorial, I am STUCK. Game breaking glitch/bug that is pretty irritating....",2
It's not bad.,4
"Downloaded game. Got stuck at the title screen. Finally got the game to load. Had to do a 1+ GB update. Started playing. Gameplay is clicker-style. Zero strategy. Game told me it had to update. Got kicked back to the title screen and stuck there. I uninstalled this app. This ""game"" is a blemish on the Nintendo legacy. Shame on the folks in Kyoto for putting their name on this.",1
"BGM is great, loved it. but its only yet another arpg with good graphics",3
Fantastic original game,5
amazing,5
Won't stop telling me there is a new version available and not letting me pass the tutorial,4
It'd the sh**,5
Nice game but need to have a joystick to move with. Trying to move by keeping your finger on the screen is bad. My finger covers to much (CANNOT SEE) and doesn't respond to GOOD. plz consider adding a joystick function. Thx,4
Too much words.,3
Excuse me but it seems like the servers are down or the game won't let me connect and when I do it takes forever to download. And if i leave the app thinking it keeps downloading it won't let me in anymore.,2
"Thank you Nintendo you really out did yourself with this one. This game, like the rest of the Nintendo mobile games has such a polish. The characters are loveable, the music is poppin, and the bite size missions make this the perfect game.",5
You have to download something new every mission,2
So Depressing,1
It's good but my father is in prison.,3
Game does not work once you get to the co op tutorial. It leaves you stuck on the screen and there's nothing you can do about it. I've taken all steps asked to correct it but it didn't fix anything. Do not spend money on this game. Will change rating if and when it's fixed.,2
"Its a really great game, very addictive, and I've quickly fallen in love with it, but... After the first few hours of playing it, co-op has randomly broken, it gets stuck with the little animation for something loading, when looking for a room it includes the searching tab, but either way, I can't get co-op to work anymore",4
"Wack... I was expecting more from Nintendo, couldn't play more than a minute... Boring",2
This game is very fun I haven't played much but I love what I have seen so far I will update later.,5
"All summons are pooled into one (i.e. characters, cards, dragons) The rates are extremely low as well. So unless you're super lucky or sell your house, you won't pull what you want. Graphics and animations are nice.",1
Fun,5
i have problem with the game it does not work,2
"Awesome game; graphics are amazing, the game play is simply (upgrade, fighting style and summoning). I have been looking for a game like this for a Chaos Rings era and now I can say, all my time with be with this title. Bravo Zulu.",5
This game is amazing,5
Ok game with simple yet in the way control. Half the battlefield is covered by my finger while dodging and moving. I also cannot link my Nintendo account. I click link button and it instantly pops up 'Process Cancelled'.,3
"Controls are awful, the game constantly needs to download something to play a new map, my phone is working over time just to maintain and feels like I'm holding a fireball. The graphics are nice and it seems like it could be a good game but too many issues making it a burden to play to justify keeping it on my phone :( uninstalled",3
Great,5
It's fun. Like a more fleshed out White Cat Project from a few years ago.,5
Control is meh.,3
I don't know why ppl keep complaining abt gacha game in mobile phone especially from cygames. If you dont want to get a paywall just do grind. And i don't know why ppl complaining abt rates. I got 2 5star dragon and 2 5star character after spending 2x10 summon. Maybe its luck idk. And i dont spend money until now and dont want too later.,4
"Great game and if i may overstep my boundaries, i have a suggestion. In the castle when upgrading buildings, i feel that making it so several smithwyrms can be working on a single building at once is great idea. it would not be too game changing and overall would still have the same efficiency as upgrading two buildings at once. very useful in situations where only one thing requires an upgrade or you are only able to afford one upgrade.",5
You have to pay to advance in the game.,1
I dont understand some people on here. This was clearly a gacha game from the beginning yet still complain about it being gacha? This is an amazing and fun game and the dragon changing mechanic is really fun and unique. Dragalia Lost easily sets itself apart by having an engaging story and co op play. If your okay with the gacha system this is a really well made game that doesnt cater to whales. Im f2p and I can breeze through the story missions easily with just 3 or 4 star units.,5
"Refuses to load past the title screen. Won't connect to server. Please fix soon, managed to do some of the tutorial before game crashed.",1
Simple and cute fun!,5
Thing won't install at all,1
So fun,5
Amazing production.,5
Ha,5
A good game with nice graphics and what seems to be an interesting story BUT I seem to be stuck infinitely loading on the co-op event screen. There's no way to skip this tutorial and restarting the app does nothing to lessen the supposed never ending load.,3
"This device is not authorized to leave a good review. Since i installed the game it only gives me a screen saying ""This device is not authorized to play the game""",1
"This game is awesome! I was hooked in the first five minutes. It has a great story, fleshed out characters, complex yet simple to understand equipment, skill, and upgrade systems, and the gameplay itself is fun and flashy. And who doesn't enjoy smashing evil monsters as a dragon?! I expect this quality from a paid game. Highly recommend to any RPG fan!",5
Game is good but if coop bug dont get fixed soon nobody will play this game,2
Absolutely hate the controls for moving. It's so finicky and just annoying. Aside from that I like the game for the most part. All the downloading is annoying though.,3
"It's alright, the gacha rates are definitely more in line with GBF/other gacha games than FEH which is way more generous. I'm still getting used to the controls but they're quite interesting and refreshing.",4
Fix the controls and the game wouldn't suck,2
"This game is very well made but there is one thing that needs to be changed. The summon rate for 5 stars is horrible, probably some of the lowest rates I've seen. Music, gameplay, and art are all solid. I'd like to give this game a perfect review but the gacha portion of the game is really holding back. The 5 star rate should be higher and they should add an element of choice to the 5 star you get like being able to pick character, dragon, and etc.",4
"Needs to update or something, I'm stuck in tutorial menus for online co-op. I'm forced to make a lobby and the game just loads and loads, no lobby. Please fix this",4
"Would like to play this game but I keep getting a ""failed to connect to server"" message",1
It's Dope,5
"Great game! Love the art, and music! Thanks Nintendo!",5
"I was having a lot of fun with this game, until it forces you to open a co-op room quest. The game is permanently stuck in loading for me, and I cannot progress further. I've deleted and redownloaded, cleared cache, reset my router and everything. Nothing works sadly. Do not spend money on this game till you manage to get past the beginner introductory quests.",3
Every time there was a loading screen my phone would stop responding to touch input but the screen was still animated. Had to restart my phone to regain functionality. Never had an issue like this before and I play a lot of mobile games.,1
"Not gonna suck tendos stick but they did a pretty decent job here on this game. I wanna say amazing but of course everyone has critics. Play it and you definitely wont regret it. If your from the anime community you will probably see the things that kill me about this 😅 they made a pretty good idea that if written properly could have even become an anime. The controls are innovative and fresh, don't deny them because it doesn't feel right. It shouldn't. Its a new way most games have yet to try and honestly its pretty good. The artwork is cute as i-don't-know-what but the only problem i see is the dialogue. Its… *sigh* not that good tbh 😓 a little close though…",5
Really awesome fun game !!!,5
It's Nintendo I love them since super Nintendo,5
"==ONLY POORLY RATED BECAUSE OF THE IAP (In game purchases)==  Now hear me out. This game is extremely fun, well polished, has some of the best music out there, and the sound design is amazing!   All this is destroyed by OUTLANDISH prices, from starter packs to a simple 10 pull (31 US Dollars!) I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless you go completely free to play.  I usually buy all the starter packs for games I really appreciate like this one, if anything for just support to make sure they can keep the game running. I really hope they re-think their pricing because it's abysmal.  ALSO one other knock to the game is the controls, they feel really stiff. You can't do more than one on screen command at once I.E. Control your hero with one hand and attack with the other. You have to completely let go of the movement just to attack, it's really clunky.",2
Wackiness,1
"Big nintendo fan! This game has a really good soundtrack, the game doesnt push you to buy anything which is a very good thing! The game can be played without spending any money! Overall 10/10 nintendo did a good job! :)",5
Fun game and i like it just wish the tutorial wasnt forced since specially since the game freezes when i click make coop room and now cant play so yay me.,3
Hi I really like how the game is so far! The graphics are amazing and the characters are super sweet! I got to the coop tutorial and it's just stuck loading. Please fix!! The game is new and I'm looking forward to the many things it has. Thank you for your time.,4
Great gameplay but the gacha rates are so ridiculously bad,3
"Great action adventure rpg, Nintendo did well with this. I spend most of my day playing it.",5
玩到第二章开了多人模式进不去！！！一点开就卡住！！,2
Awesome,5
Can I refund my money? I was enjoying this game then you decided to take out free wyrms from coop plays.,1
Wack 2gb download and still need to download 2 mb per map? Why not just pack it all as 1 download,1
"The game is awesome ask around except all the stories... It's more comics than have, at first anyway. And ask the items had numbers instead of names which was confusing. Amazing potential.... Keep it up.",4
"Honestly, best rpg on play store not gonna lie.",5
"Pretty fun game, people should just play the games and have fun and stop trying to focus on getting 5* the game is really generous with wyrmite so spamming 10 roll isn't a problem.",5
I love the gameplay,5
Great game,5
"Dragalia Lost is amazing. It hits the nail on the head for presentation, with every little menu and effect popping out with vibrant colours and making the game feel a lot more active as a whole, with the upbeat music complimenting it well. It has trouble at times on the performance side, but I personally don't mind. Gameplay is skill based and responsive, and co-op works like a charm. The rates in the gacha are low, but the currency for summoning is extremely plentiful and there are measures to ensure you get 5 stars every so often. Every character and dragon has their own stories that you unlock as you progress, which so far have all been pretty good. Overall, if the quality stays this consistent in the future, this might be one of the best mobile games out there for a long while.",5
Great game!!,5
"Actually a good game, the gacha rates are a bit low but the game is generous when it comes to giving free gems.",5
Another pay to win cash grabber,1
我攒了整整一天，5次10连，一个五星都没有，骗氪也不能这么过分！,1
"Great graphics and music. Gameplay works smoothly. People should remember that this is a mobile game, not a hardcore AAA console/PC RPG. For a mobile game it works as expected",5
This is just a great game. End of story. PS the soundtrack is amazing.,5
Very simple and charming,5
"Was excited for this game to release but once ive started playing it, it has a lot of things you have to download. And takes all my storage of my phone so I had to uninstall it. I would love to play this game but I just hate how much storage it takes.",3
I like it very much one problem that really isn't that big deal is that sometimes I see no H's when the characters talk. Other than that though a very fun game!,5
Chibi turns to awesome dragon im sold,5
Nintendo can you guys make more games for the cellular phones I'm a big fan of all Nintendo games you guys make and my favorite are Pokemon Zelda Mario Bros.,5
So far so good. Graphics are nice and the voice overs are a nice touch. But as with all mobile games nowadays I'm sure there will be a paywall. But until then I'm enjoying it just came out so there will be improvements. Time will tell. Prices are a bit steep compared to other games like it. But that's what we get in 2018. Would much rather it be premium with no iap but hey I guess that's too much to ask for in this day and age. Too many people willing to shell out cash for that to happen.,5
Here BFor 100 Mill And Game Runs Smoothly Great Story so Far Easy Controls Voice acting is Nice Love It :D,5
This game would be so much better if I didn't lose on the daily quests because the next wave doesn't spawn,3
"This is exactly why Nintendo needs to step into the smartphone industry. Games like this will bring me to them every single time. Deep story, great graphics, massive character selection to match the gameplay. Keep it up.",4
"Chapter 1: 3 with the rock golem, I got bumped to a different place after he initiated the roll attack and slammed me into the wall. Other then that great game!!",4
The way to move around is annoying sometimes when I'm going one way it suddenly switches to somewhere else,4
"Lots to do, combat is fun, micro transactions aren't horrible. Good time killer.",5
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh be ready to spend your life savings. Gg,1
Like the game but couldn't keep downloading everything. Took up too much memory,2
I love it but their is a bug in the tutorial where you create a room in event and it gets stuck and keeps loading but nothing happens also the gacha rates so very poor it's such a low chance to get a 5 star.,1
"This is just pokemon quest remastered. There is nothing that separates this game from pokemon quest besides the art and animation. It's just another auto play to pay. People are saying it has a good story, have you read the story?!? All they do is introduce new characters and progress through a small campaign. You hit a paywall after about an hour and a half of play. You 1 shot just about everything besides bosses so theres no need NOT to use the auto mode. Only reason I am even giving it two stars is because I enjoy games with special powerups and synthesis items which I feel this game does well. But the gacha rates are absolutely horrendous.",2
TRASH SUMMON RATES. Trash weeb game with terrible gameplay. Literally just a clicking simulator. Fire the idiots that developed this garbage!,1
Cool,5
"Didn't really get very far so I don't feel I can evaluate it fully but I dislike what I did play. The controls were awkward, gameplay wasn't interesting, and I disliked that I couldn't make it full-screen on my Galaxy S8+. The graphics and voice-acting seemed okay though. I just lost all interest very quickly especially since I disliked everything else.",2
I managed to work around the download error by batch downloading everything... Which is rather annoying since the so has to be open for the full hour or so that takes... But now that I'm in it's going pretty well. Controls are a bit jumpy but I'll probably get used to them soon.,3
Couldn't get past the first loading screen,1
Very fun game,5
"First impression- Audio: very much anime from voice, bgm, and even opening. Artstyle: I like the chibiness of the character in 3D and stylistic in portrait. Gameplay: much more player involve than other game of its kind, there is an auto mode but you lose out on resources.  Price: noticeably higher, probably because Nintendo need their cut. > absurdly huge once you found out that this gacha game is a 3 items gacha game. This game has the typical 10 pull but it's so diluted because there are 3 types [character, dragon, item] and along with their respective tier so it's more like 9, so out of 10 pull you have abyssmally small chance of getting good draw. There is more materials you need to enchance the item you pulled too but haven't gotten far enough to guage but already as you can tell this game is grind hell.  Final point- This game somehow makes Knights Chronicle look superb in comparision, and at the moment that game pvp scene is p2w. KC has seperated pull unlike DL KC has guarantee char choice after 8 and 10 pull while DL has 1% increase pity rate but pointless considering it get reset if let say you want 5* char instead of 5* item.",2
Yeet,5
There's a lot to do in this game it by far the most enjoyable game to play. Once you start you won't stop playing. There's some bugs like I can't re-enter the event quest and gives me error. Its the initial launch so bugs are bound to happen. Overall amazing,5
I really love this game but it's been very choppy so far(it doesn't move smoothly) and those sumonning rates are killing my experience with the game so far...But it's still pretty amazing,4
Wow. Thanks for the GIANT FILESIZE WARNING /s,1
Amazing well made game,5
Um oh yeah yeah umu,5
To many words of praise to say everything on this one little review.,5
"It's just another free to play game. There's nothing special about it. You play the opening mission, then you're greeted with the exact same information overload as every other free to play game ever. You plop down to a screen with 20 icons, a bunch of exclamation points, and a lot of links to consumable items that cost real money. If you have played any free to play game, this is just going to be more of that. The controls are a highlight though. The game actually does control really well, and it's pretty satisfying to play. They did manage to come up with a good mobile control scheme for an action RPG. It's just attached to a very bland, very cliche game that's exactly like every other game in the genre. I don't recommend the game, but I hope they make something more substantial with this control style. It's a shame to waste it on this kind of game.",2
Really love this game,5
首20抽沒女角.五星，垃圾遊戲,1
"Tbh I am so far very impressed, and plan to keep playing!",5
I'm unable to Go further in the game because of the the Co-op Bug. What a Joke,1
"Was ok until I got to the co-op tutorial. Gets locked up every time I try to create a room. Cleared cache, reinstalled, still the same thing. Too bad.",1
"Let me start off by saying this game seems pretty decent. I won't say it's great, but I won't say it's terrible. It reminded me a lot of Bleach Brave Souls as far as the game play. Your party members are ""collected"" via gacha mechanics, which I'm not particularly fond of. It's a very playable game if you're into that sort of thing, but I was really hoping this would be different when I pre-registered.",4
DAOKO is amazing. I like the ost.,5
Im stuck on the tutorial for the co op part it just gets stuck on the creating a room load,4
"Such a great game! I really love it. Music is breathtaking and visuals are cute and vibrant. No ad interruptions to speak of either. Idk if it is just my experience or what but it's fairly easy to get 4s and 5s, they basically are giving them to you!! also love the coop system. Only critique I have is that there needs to be more time on timed quests (solo). Given the clunky movement controls it's kind of hard to take a time attack level seriously when you're steering your character one way and they go another. It's a waste of the precious little time that's given and stamina. And if you won't adjust the time at least improve movement controls because there's a lot to be desired to say the least. Time attack levels kind of force you to go the coop route because at least everyone already has the mindset to split up/ kill quickly. Other than that this game deserves no less than a solid 5 stars",5
They forgot to make it fun.,2
"Amazing animation and outstanding soundtrack, one of the best role playing games I've played in a long time. It's something I've always looked for, the controls are simple and fun.",5
Feels like an actual game,5
"This is a good rpg. A very simple design that hold a good bit of charm. Ill be frank though, the controls are simply poor. Its not that theyre not intuitive. Its just that they don't work well and you're constantly repositioning your finger. I just want a joystick mechanic. It would feel much better. For those who like pay to win. And will throw tons of money at a game.... don't play this. Its not worth it. The amount you get in return for what you spend is just weird. Besides there's no vip system. A hard working free to play will easily pass you. The story is good. Usual plot holes. Why doesnt main villian kill you when he can etc. But whatever. This is a 4.5 for me. But i cant do that so i guess a 5☆",5
"Its a great game don't get me wrong, but it takes up alot of space",4
After a certain point game stopped working at all and spamming me with an error message,1
Japanese? In a world where English is dominant? Come on,1
Its really cute but can't we download the full thing in one go then going to the help section to do it?,5
It won't let me past the tutorial summoning. It eiather shuts down or freezes.,2
Really fun,5
This game is amazing but when you get to the event part it wont go through,5
Your average pay to win crappy game,1
I didn't know what type of game this was beforehand but I saw some friends posting gacha summoning results. While I enjoy those mechanics there has to be a fun game behind them for me to care. These type of action games with touch controls just feel absolutely atrocious... maybe I would play this on my Switch in handheld mode but not with touch controls.,2
One of the best mobile games ive played uwu,5
Too much to download,2
"Game textures won't load. Also Gacha rates are garbage and its basically a reskin on other gachas. The paywall is way rougher than those games as well. Hoping for change, but doubtful.",1
"The first few hours I spent playing was pretty fun. I thought the character designs and menus were well thought out and I was excited to play the game. The controls on the other hand felt a bit wonky for my taste. Moving and dashing felt ok, but trying to perform a dash attack to break guard from a monster was the most frustrating part for me. Most of the time my character wouldn't perform the move and the moments where it did perform the move it felt more lucky rather than by my own skill. The single thing that frustrates me about this game however is my inability to progress due to an in game problem. The story forces you into going through tutorials such as summoning or working on your castle. This would've been totally fine except for the fact that I am stuck in a loading loop after creating a co op room, and since it's part of the story I am unable to do anything else until it's been fixed. Others have had a similar issue, but nothing has been said by the developers that ensure the players going through this issue that it's being looked at. I'm willing to give this game a 4/5 stars when I'm able to progress more, but as for now the game is just ""ok"" for me.",3
"Yet another garbage slot-machine/gachapon game with a stamina mechanic, designed to create a cycle of reward that encourages repeat spending of money for immediate gratification. Games like this should be regulated as gambling and harmful to the development of children.",1
Game looks great but that only gets you so far. Pay to win is all this game is. Please done waste your time.,1
Pretty exterior but it's the same stank p2w generic garbage,1
Lit,5
"This is one of the better mobile games thats I have played. The controls are good, the characters and story are engaging and unlike most other mobile games, it's very light on the pay to win. It's there but it doesn't directly tell you that you can buy currency at anytime.",5
I'm stuck at the title screen with a message saying unable to connect to server. That is when it doesn't give me a solid white screen.,1
"Story seems ok so far. Gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect. They clearly wanted another cash grab f2p like Fire Emblem... But I don't think this game captures that for me. Probably would have been better to make this a full fledged console game, build the fan base then do a cash grab gacha game. Doesn't make sense to me to do it this way but it's not my business. My main issue is that 1. It's slow to start. This is a mobile game. Every other quest being some long drawn out story is annoying. I don't believe I have seen an option to go faster. Just skip. (though I'll give you props for summarizing the cut scene if you choose to skip) 2. The controls in the dungeon are terrible.",3
Great game the music is amazing. The only thing i dislike is the movement controls the game should make the stick or whatever lock in where your finger is first tapped,5
"Please use clear language instead of vague bs. This game won't run on a rooted phone, isn't that a lot clearer than ""you are not authorized to run this app"" (or something along those lines). The graphics are great, the controls could be better, and the fun wears off quick, it's just another pay to win game",2
Best Music App 2018,5
Gud,5
It is very fun to kill time,4
The games amzing don't get me wrong but there's only one small detail im thinking about...probably being able to play the game side ways. But other than that this game is Great!,5
"Great game, but once I got past 2-1 I'm sent to the event tutorial and game freezes been like this all day and now I can't play anymore, and also the fact that there is a 1.5mb download at every stage is a bit crazy even after the 1.5g initial download",3
Cool,5
IIts amazing,5
What went wrong Nintendo. I thought you knew how to make a good gacha? This is actually just a prettier bad gacha. The story is even super basic.,2
"This game is a master piece. Beautiful music heart felt story and charming characters. Feels more like a light RPG than a mobile game. This game is very fair when it comes to play time and rewards that you don't have to spend a penny. This is the best action RPG mobile app on the market. If you are even the slightest bit interested, try it it's free and you won't regret it.",5
"For Christ's sake, would it kill them to make a offline compatible game.",1
"Love the game so far, but the controls suck. Would be much easier if it was a joystick rather than swiping.",4
HORRIBLE drop rates! BEWARE do not DOWNLOAD this game!,1
Not bad,5
Need little bit work on the graphics that's all,4
Horrible gacha rates. Not recommended. No point in giving out freebies when the rate is 2%. 0.50% for a god damn 5 star unit.,1
"Dragalia Lost is the refresh the Gacha game Industry has needed for so long, weather it be the Nice F2p summoning that doesn't have separated banners to pull Characters and Weapons, or the Non grind designed levels and way you progress. this game is truly world class. 10/10",5
Pokemón red and blue,5
It looks fun but won't let me play at all,3
"Banner rate up for 5star super low chance, disappointed it😡",1
"I can't give this an honest review because I can't download the 1.7gb additional download after install... Not because I'm out of room, but because I can't turn off the music/download in the background.",1
This game has the worst controls I've ever seen in a mobile game. For a combat-based game that requires you to dodge attacks quickly it is inexcusable. Why couldn't they have just implemented a joystick?,2
Good gacha,5
Nice game,5
I dont understand... why make a game have 4 heroes walk along the map when you can only use one? Whats the point if you keep switching back and forth? Also I hate the fact that you get a random support card+dragon+character from a 10x summon. What i mean is if i buy a 10x summon for a hero i expect to have 10 heroes of diffrent rarities not a bunch of items all the same time. Ontop of that the game itself looks like its gonna be a memory HOG and i mean liiterally DL after DL's every stage needed you will be DLing something. The only thing i like about this game is the music other than that its a fail to me esp the gatcha system.,2
Getting better,5
"Great game over all, but way to big for me to keep on my phone",4
"I love it, it's unique, however I'd like it more if I can get passed the endless loading when I try to create a room in events. I can't do anything.",4
Awesome execution. Really has that genuine Nintendo feel.,5
Game is absolutely amazing but the controls suck! Rather than having a nice joystick you have to drag your character and you end up going the wrong direction to often and trying hold down to do a charge attack often gets mixed with a roll Dodge. Controls 2/5,5
It's fun and the graphics ain't bad either awesome job,5
I loved this game I'm so glad I got pre order,5
Great game. Controls are a little uncomfortable and a little hard to use but fun.,5
"This is one game by nintendo i can say I TRULY enjoy, the music, graphics and mostly importantly story behind the characters is amazingly crafted. 11/10",5
"It was fun when I could get it to work, but I can't get it to load on anything but my cellular and I can't afford that. Thanks for making a game I can't play on basic wifi",1
woo,5
Its fun its got a great stroy so far i like the objective of the game in my opinion the storyline is better than any other nintendo mobile game i have played,5
"The controls do not allow for ease of movement and battle. You can either move or attack. When attacking, your character picks a random direction (usually the wrong one) and moves/attacks in that direction, leaving you vulnerable to enemy attacks. Overall very disappointed with every Nintendo mobile release so far.",1
"So far so good! Voice acting, graphics, and gameplay are all great so far.",4
Litty,5
WAIT I JUST NOTICED ITS MADE BY NINTENDO!!!!😈,5
I couldn't even get into the game at all so could someone help pls,1
"The fighting is over so quick, and there's so many things you have to click through. I don't want to spend all that time if I don't even like the game. LET ME PLAY IT",2
"It looks promising, but all of the characters are blank/empty models. I bought a tablet just to play this and I'm very disappointed with the result",1
"It's truly a great game but I need help. I'm at the part where co-op is introduced but I get stuck with loading, like there's a glitch. I have closed and open the app multiple times and restarted my phone. My wifi isn't a problem either. Can I please get help.",4
"It's definitely fun and has a good story (so far) but I can't get past the begining part,where the sister appears,after the cutscene the game crashes,and my character textures aren't showing,the terrain is showing and is beautiful,but the characters are just shadows,fix please,if it's just me,please tell me how to fix it if you know how",3
Pretty boring,3
I'm definitely enjoying this game so far . It's quite fun and definitely entertaining. So far it has exceeded my expectations.,5
I want to rate it 5 stars but every time I try to create a room for co-op it justs loads and that's all it does,2
"I love it and HATE it because I love dragons and this is so far the best game I've had for Anime and dragons, I HATE IT BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY DOWNLOADS AND THEN I HAD TO DELETE DELETE OF STORAGE >:(",4
Had a blast playing it till I hit chapter 3 and crashed every time I tried to start it. Hope this is fixed soon.,2
.5% drop rate on banner units. Huge cash grab. Don't expect much from this horrific gacha game.,1
"I love this so much. It brings so much nostalgia from my childhood playing breath of fire. Story and characters are fun and dragon shape shifting makes battles awesome. Only small problem is with drag controls, sometimes shifting directions makes the character flip out. Its a wonderful game. Thank you Nintendo.",5
Great game fun like the protagonists gameplay is simple upgrading is easy and not complicated. Whatever you do don't let the people crying about being under power dissuade you from playing they just don't know how to optimize their party.,5
Minus not being able to get past the Co op tutorial (not able to find a match) this is an exciting game and I can't wait to see where it evolves from here,5
"Enjoying so far. Plays great on my S9+ but on my Galaxy Tab 3, it does not render correctly. Just black shapes. A bummer cuz I was hoping to play on the tablet when I am at home.",4
"Amazing! Gameplay is fun and simple, the concept is really good, and it has more content than current RPG games!",5
Not finding event in co-op so l can't progress any further,2
10 out of 10. Such an amazing game so far.,5
Great game,1
Loved it,5
"It's alright, the summoning rates are super harsh though",4
"I have to say, I enjoy Dragalia Lost so far! It's brought to players attentions that there is a download for each cutscene and area, however there is a batch download option that removes the tedious area by area download! Is it pay to win? Absolutely not when you can traverse and level with the starting summon you get, the allies you come across along the way and taking advantage of the weapon enhancements! (Not to mention the amount of rewards they give you for being able to summon for free. I pulled off at least one SSR and three SR pulls through free draws!) While the game has a stamina gauge, it recharges pretty quickly, allowing you to get to the next are with ease! Well done I say! Well done!",5
Having a problem at the co-op menu. When I press the create menu it loads forever and cant do anything.,2
Stuck at Coop tutorial. Please fix.,1
Fire emblem hero's all over again 🤣🤣🤣🤣,5
"This game is amazing, it is a beautiful RPG with amazing graphics, this is my favorite game now! Very good job on this game, and thank you Nintendo!",5
Can't even play because the characters show up black on my screen and it's laggy as heck. Check for bugs before you release a game ..,1
"This game is amazing, love the voice acting. They should make this game into a anime. One problem is that when you get to the point where you completed chapter one and it tells you that you can do co-op it loads forever it. I waited five minutes for that thing to load.",4
"Great game, reminds me a bit if Zelda but with a dungeon crawling first angle. Sort of like Happy Dungeons if you know that game, but a bit better I feel.",5
Same garbage gacha with garbage rates.,1
I like the combat and production values,4
Don't know if my tablet isnt new enough to play it but the graphics are messed up I can't see any of my characters they are just black shadows and on quests the trees and enemies are also blacked out shadows I am very disappointed wanted to play but can't play like that please fix,3
Great music and voice acting.,4
Controls annoying af,1
"Honestly, this game is fun and I really want to love it. But its controls and the gacha system really bring it down. I'll still play it, but this game could stand to improve some. Also, downloaded and played this game on its day of release and the mandatory tutorial for the co-op section is broken. Like it takes forever to actually create a room, giving the idea that the game is essentially frozen (I've been waiting at the same screen for over 4 hours now), and since it's mandatory you can't skip it or do anything else in the game until you do this task. I know it's supposed to give you an idea of what to do there and how to do it, but it just caused me to stop playing for the remainder of the day. Hopefully they fix the frozen room thing soon, and I'm even more hopeful they stop implementing these mandatory tutorials so oppressively.",3
Mo,5
"It has too many required downloads after the initial download. I understand ""loading screens"" however, ""downloading screens?"" Plus its laggy af, its a great idea and has so much potential, yet it falls short only due to the excessive downloads in game. Two stars because of this issue. Fix that and ill change it to the 4 it should get.",2
Get to the first co op an the game freeze up,4
Please fix the bug that makes all 3d element nothing but a black splotch,3
Haven't played it yet because of the 1.5gb download that you have to download.,2
"Nintendo and Cygames out did themselves, this game is amazing!",5
"Awsome game, just update the controllers because they feel a little wonky.",5
Ty for a good game,5
"Overall solid game, the gacha system doesn't require money to get anything good as you get most material but just doing stuff. Movement is a tad wonky but overall great along with combat. Love the designs!",5
I love this game but i am on an android lg escape 3 and i was ten fold summoning and then all of a sudden my app made a screeen sound and then the screen turned black with a tiny white dot can any body help,1
Nintendo is huge but has to make horrible rates doesn't matter if your p2p or f2p your getting screwed,1
Cant progress the game makes you create a room for Avenue of power and it just continuously loads never making the room waited for like 20mins,2
Wao lovelie game and some graphic,5
"Honestly, it's clear Nintendo wants kids to whale on this game. The rates are so horrible. Not sure why Nintendo is hoping kids get into gambling. Belgium should take a look at this game.",1
My game is stuck trying to do co-op game play help me please I can't continue until this tutorial is over help please I'm missing out on this amazing game,5
Another game by Nintendo,3
Best Game ever,4
Amazing graphics! Love combat too! Just for the sake of all things holy make movement better.,4
Awesome but where's autoplay,5
"Game was great until co-op bug. No need to pay ( for now at least ) have 3200 power and U will need at least one 5 star and equip them with ur beat stuff. Also make sure to all ways upgrade dragon, units, etc. Ur dragon atk will help you big time and make sure to have healer. Pick a healer. Would give a 5 star if fixed.",5
"I'm having problems with the ""create a room"" tutorial. It wont move on, it's stuck on the loading screen for a long time.",4
I cant seem to Download the last .09 mb of the game. It keeps saying network error even though my network is fine. Ill rate higher once I'm able to play,2
i suggest you fix your games before launching it... installed it and cant even play it due to server errors... i have to uninstall,1
Its really fun,5
Good graphics and great music but the gameplay isn't that fun.,3
Cant play. What kind of crazy phone app makes you download over 1 gig of data to play. Sorry. Nintendo you were once a great company. Now.... You really became the worst for phone games.,1
"Can't advance any further without doing the co-op quest but it kept freezing every time I attempt it. So I've already hit a brick wall within the first 30mins, Nice.",1
Could not connect to server. Great launch Nintendo.,1
Gg,5
Great Job Nintendo! It's an amazingly fun game-- jusr takes up alot of space-- 10/10,5
On Ch.1 3-1 with the Iron Golem boss I have found a glitch. Well what happened was the Iron Golem used his roll atk by the 2 walls in the corner and I got sent flying into a empty map.,5
A great game so far despite it being sorta like a hack and slash. Looking forward to future updates!,5
Waaaaaay too big. 2 gigs and the downloads keep coming.,2
OK th rates are rigged like 8 resets 1 rainbow and it was a wyrmprint the game isn't gonna last long Nintendo got way to greedy,1
Good game but it has issues. Too much lag in cutscenes and tne story portion. Controls are wonky but would be easily fixed with a fixed joystick.,3
"A lot of care has gone into this title, from fully-voiced cutscenes to a unique and fun J-Pop soundtrack. So far, it looks to be a genuine action RPG and not some mobile half-measure.",5
To big of a game takes up so much storage even if you have nothing on your phone makes the game unplayable after a few chapters,1
Won't connect to servers!,1
Didn't even let me connect cause Wi-Fi errors,1
"The graphics are beautiful, the story is pretty standard so far, but come on... 1.08 gb download to start it, then you play for about 15 min through the 1st chapter and another 200 mb to download to continue. I'm sorry but that is insane, I don't have the internet speeds so this is excruciating to download (and it failed after several attempts because my screen went black, so I have to keep the phone awake through the 30 min+ download time). Controls aren't too bad but here's to hoping we get a directional pad instead of tap and swipe to move.",3
"Really cool RPG, hope the sequel comes to Switch.",5
Its great except...WHERE ARE THEIR NOSES,5
Every time I open the game it fails to connect to the server so I haven't been able to do anything at all.,2
The controls are wonky and the gacha is very rigged. Normally a 0.5 percent rate wouldn't bother me for the higher units. But in this case the gacha is combined meaning realistically your odds of pulling that hero is way lower. Add to that the premium currency prices are pretty high. Play for free til you get brickwalled then walk away.,2
"Poor Controls, Terrible Rates, Low currency rewards per chapter completion, and overpriced shop equals just a bad game overall. Only good things are the card arts and music everything else is mediocre to horrible.",2
I think that it's a ok game,5
"Just amazing, what all my friends and couple family members have been waiting for in terms of a co-op rpg mobile experience",5
"I've been playing for a little and I must say, this game really takes in elements from other mobile games and makes it work. The music is pretty good, as well as character designs. I haven't bumped into much problems except for having to use two hands instead of one which has been an inconvenience for many but it barely bothers me. I'd also like to take the time to address that there is a way to download ALL of the data so you don't have to keep on downloading things everytime you attempt to start a quest. Im pretty sure the game tells you this too so.o.",4
It's an amazing game the graphics look amazing but the controls kind of suck I try to play with one hand but then have to use both hands to be able to do stuff I just wish it was little bit easier to control and after reading some reviews people are saying that they're underleveled after first couple World like places hopefully they fix everything I will keep it installed but probably won't play it for a little while till it's fixed.,3
Noice,5
Black screen keeps coming wjen starting up the app. Help,1
"I think this game is amazing for a phone game, I wish it was a game on switch. It's fun, the story is very interesting, and changing into a dragon is pretty fun. However, the moving controls are AWFUL, like the worst I've ever seen in a mobile game, the slightest twitch will make your character freak out, also, there is a co-op bug unfortunately that I feel victim too. There is a tutorial on events, and co-op, but it trys to load and freezes, stuck on a loading screen, not loading anything. I want to give it a 5, I should give it a 3, but I do enjoy the game, and I hope they fix everything in the near future.",4
Great game,5
"This game is not bad. It's surprisingly very well made. The story is interesting and the music is sweet and nice. Gacha games are the worst ways to use money on, but with the rewards you get, you dont have to use money unless you wanna use money. Overall sweet game, but the controls on how to move could be fixed a little more. Sometimes i move my character then suddenly it clips and it moves in a different way. Probably just me, but hey it just got release so good job.",4
"Loving the game so far, stuck on a bug where I cant ""create a room"" for the mandatory coop tutorial. Please fix this soon!",5
"I can't actually play the game, thus the low score. It's the 27th and i dled it earlier but it keeps refusing to go past the title screen. Saying it can't connect to the server. Help?",3
Super nice graphic and fun to play! It is a little bit hard on the control.,5
So far so good. Re-Rolled a few times and got cool characters that I like.,5
Forever stuck on the coop tutorial. Everytime I click on create a room the game just loads forever.,3
Black screen after the first zone. Waste of 2gb.,1
Like it.,4
Love the music and characters. Voice acting is bad but that ok.,5
It's definitely unique game one of a kind,5
"Generic gatcha/stamina mobile game. If you've played a game where you summon troops from a gatcha, you've played this game. The missions are also super boring, and movement input is frequently interrupted. The only good thing is the phenomenal music and good voice acting.",2
Additional Download Simulator,4
Stuck in bug where it doesn't let me pass co op mode so 1 star until fixed,1
Takes up so much space ahhhhhh but quality game,4
Soooo cute and adorable i love all the different customizations involved when you need to use the optimize option or not.  The chibi characters are all unique and super cute and the colors are very vibrant. I appreciate the dual audio so much and the music by daoko is amazing. It was so worth the wait to play this game.,5
"If you played FFXIII, than this is not your game.",3
It's fun and simple.,4
"I was enjoying it but nothing major. I got stuck on a tutorial where it was supposed to be a co-op and you need to make a room.. I did what I can, cleared cache, reinstall etc... nothing.. it wouldnt load anymore. Good concept tho.",3
Love it so far but I can't go passed the coop mission and it keeps me at the loading page,3
Bugged coop,1
"Actual review: In short, very solid action rpg with some great touch screen mechanics that remind me of spirit tracks for the ds..the graphics are top notch and the whole world building is pretty cool..and the music has me hooked",5
I loved it!,5
Awesome game ty Nintendo and cygames well done love it,5
Good story but make sure to have a lot GB on your device because every level you play you have to download it.,3
"The art style is cute, and the music is very catchy. The combat is pretty simple. So far I""m enjoying the game.",4
yeet,5
Love the music,5
Been looking forward for this game expecting greatness.,5
I dont care what anyone says or complains about. This game is better than any I've played. Thanks Cygames and Nintendo 👍🏻 I'll definitely put money into this for support and to all those that are complaining about such a great game for things that arent all that relevant dont have a good sense of what great mobile gaming is. You will all most likely play it anyways so you really need to get over it guys. They worked really hard on a brand new title so support them rather than bash them again like everyone did with super Mario run. Thanks again Nintendo you have a supporter right here for sure,5
Pay to win,2
"""This device is not authorized to play the game"" What that mean? That's discrimination my cell phone is offended.",1
"Personally i love this game. Beautiful music, great graphics, a pretty good story, and a great battle system. Its a little clunky at times but im sure thats a easy fix with a update or two. This game is well worth the time. Nintendo keeps rolling out the hits!",5
"Entertaining, Visually Pleasing with an Intriguing Story.",4
Would vote higher but introduction cutscenes are just blacked out with the audio still running,3
Crash more please asian game,1
I've been a fan of Nintendo since the 80s but unfortunately there following netmarble and the other pay to win bs that all other mobile games are on..why so all these mobile games have that pay to win pay to advance garbage..I will never spend a cent on a pay to win mobile game..I'd rather pay for a monthly subscription..when is this type of mobile game garbage gonna stop..all these company's making these mobile games are a bunch of money hungry greedy thieves..can someone make a game that's actually a game without the pay to win GARBAGE!!!,1
Amazing game so far pretty colors and the story is pretty good so far. Turning into a dragon is the best part really enjoying the game so far by far my favorite Nintendo mobile game so far.,5
Loved this game !!!!!!,5
"If you have trouble linking a Nintendo account, set a different web browser as your default browser. It would not play nice with firefox but it would with the basic Samsung internet.",4
Could not get pass the co-op menu. A game enjoyment hinder bug already early this is pretty sad. Had high hopes but now can't really move forward into the game because of the bug. False hope game.,1
Just another stamina system cash grab.,1
"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS FOR THIS GAME!! This game needed a few hours of maintenance upon release but is now playable as of 10/27. Graphics are beautiful and the story is well written and very intriguing. The characters perfectly match their personalities and the voice actors make the characters come alive. The controls are quite simple and easy to understand, making the gameplay much more fun. You do not need to pay to play the game. Of course the levels are going to be harder. For those who didn't pre register, you did not get the 300 wrymite which allows you to summon more units. Yet even without those 300 extra wrymitses, completion of each quest gives you nearly 20-30 free wrymite along with extra from achievements that you complete. So I do not understand everyone complaining about needing to pay to win. Take note that you will need to download every quest (about 1.30 MB each or less) so be ready to have a lot of space on your phone. I have limited space but deleting some of my other games was worth it. Can I also add how AMAZING the music is for this game? I'm honestly down to download the soundtrack for this game because it is absolutely beautiful and enhances the gameplay! You did very well, Nintendo and Cygames. I can't wait to see where you take this game in the future! Plus, a Nintendo game giving you the ability to play as a dragon, even for a limited time? This game completely won my heart due to my affection towards dragons and of the like!",5
Best Game Ever Very Perfect on all sides you guys did great,5
"It says my phone isn't authorized to play this game. Extremely sad I preregistered and everything and can't even enjoy it, but from the sounds of it nobody else can enjoy it either. Thanks for crushing my hopes :)",1
Yay,5
I like the music,5
I love the game but I cannot create a public co-op room.,5
Pretty fun game so far,5
"Good graphics for a phone game. Everything else about this is the same old bad pay to win phone game mechanics. So those who think they can get by with low rarity units are going to be in for a surprise. You get stonewalled really fast. Not that nintendo and cygames care, they're looking for whales not actual players with this title that is for sure.",1
The geme seams good but afyer proulog text in menus is not exsisting,3
"This game really adds up...in a manner of speaking. My phone, an LG Phoenix 3, plays the game fine, but unfortunately, the amount of storage used by just the opening stages of the game filled up my phone quickly, even if I moved the app to an SD card. (I tend to download a lot of apps, so 16 GB gets bumped down to 1 GB real fast.) It is because of games like this that I actually NEED an Android tablet. Nevertheless, I like the game.",4
"""failed to connect to server""",2
"the game is good but for some reason after downloading over 1g f0to play the characters, enemies, and some trees and mushrooms are all just black shadows",3
"I'm about ready to uninstall this game. And I even paid $7.99. It was great until I got to the part were you forces you to play in the Avenue of Power event. I click to all the forced links. Then once you get to the screen where has you click a room for coop. The game freezes every single time. I have cleared cache, restarted my phone, done about everything. Ans for hours it's still stuck there. I'm just about dont with this nonsense.",1
"Love the game its just that the controls keeps messing up, like when im trying to go left it sometimes go's the other way, but other than the controls the game is really good",5
My device not autorize play the game???????? What?,1
"Its a fun game, although would like some sort of crossover with fire emblem because, DRAGONS plua first review",5
"It's a day late and a dollar short. Meaning that this format of game stopped being popular a couple years ago and it's just trying to exploit gambling addiction. Not unique, not interesting, massive waste of data.",1
Please hide the notification bar,4
Can't play because network error at second update that needs downloaded,1
I enjoy the art style but it takes up SOOOO MUCH SPACE ON MY INTERNAL PHONE DATA. Wish I could transfer it to my SD card to save space...,5
The loading for co op is long but everything else is great!,5
Controls are horrible. Really low summoning rates for good characters,1
Really fun and addicting game from Nintendo and Cygames! The controls are a little wonky but I'll keep playing.,5
Why can't I play the game it shows the authorization notice but my phone is not rooted.,1
Is there analog sticks if not can you guys please put that.,4
Horrible game,1
"It's pretty meh. Gacha contains 3 different things which aren't all useful at the start. Gameplay is basic, but touch controls still don't work well. Overall it's a disappointment.",1
"This is an amazing game, I've been restarting to get a 5* unit and I've had no luck so far but I did decide to play through it a bit and in my opinion this game is great. Awesome units, cool skills, dragons... What else could you want?",5
It is a really fun game to play,5
P2w very low rates,2
Pretty damn good i like it alot so far,5
"Good game, but Please make the downloading sizes files for smaller for phones not all phones can hold that much data",5
"This is the Rune Story replacement I've been looking for! Thanks a ton, so far so adorable! Now if we could just have a Pokemon replacement for Monster Strike my mobile library would be complete.",5
"Truly a master piece, thanks to the developments team for creating an amazing game.",5
Great,5
All the models in my game is black,4
True RPG,5
I love it already. The characters are so cute and the voices are just amazing. This game will be one of my favorite mobiles for a very long time. I do hope more characters will be released.,5
Good,5
Very good music and graphic~,4
"A fantastic action RPG in the palm of your hands, also a top tier OST.",5
Great game!,5
I'm at the point where I try to do a co-op match but it keeps freezing.. hopefully this Is fixed soon,3
Does this game REALLY need 1.5 guys to function?! No it doesn't.,1
It's ok.,3
Takes a long time to download. Anyone else have this issue?,3
"This game is amazing, the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is fun and the story is pretty interesting. I definitely will continue playing",5
"Graphic is great and cute, gameplay is fun but only thing that's annoying is the drag movement, hard to drag and use skill at the same time, and sadly no auto function, it was good but no there yet.",3
I wish i can play in my country,5
"It's one thing for a game to crash multiple times. It's another for my phone to become unresponsive during installation three times. Finally got through but when I open it a pop-up for manual/auto settings appears and again freezes my phone. Nothing on screen or even external buttons respond. Please test your games before release. I'd like to play and review the actual game, but as an unplayable inconvenience in my phone, I'll review it as such for now to bring the issue to your attention.",1
Took too much space,1
Pretty good game. Great graphics great story. Like if Nintendo made granblue. 4 stars though cause it doesn't have the cutest waifus. Get on that nintengames. Also ezelith best girl in game,4
Good 👍,5
Absolutely perfect,5
Love,5
Cant get past the title screen vant connect to server is all I keep getting,2
Download this game! It's really great. One of the best mobile phone games I've ever played.,5
"Absolutely stunning graphics and game play, you get a console game experience from a free mobile game! I expect nothing less from Nintendo! Great work!",5
Awesome.,5
"It says Error Acquiring Data after I leave the game when Im done patching, Till this has been fixed my rate is 1★",1
👎👎👎👎👎Movement and fighting controls are absolutely HORRIBLE! The game is gorgeous but the controls totally ruin the game. Uninstalled to never play again.👎👎👎👎👎,1
I was upset of the 1.5 gb download so I won't play due to space. I still got feh.,1
"Pretty simple to pick up and play. The ability to play co-op is pretty cool, and the combat is fun yet challenging.",5
I haven't played it but I love it,5
Thank Nintendo for this amazing games I will enjoy it,5
The best,5
Amazing release. Very polished game.,5
This game is one of the best so far! Good story good characters and amazing music! And i absolutely love the gameplay it makes me feel nostalgia! Hands down best mobile game!,5
"I would give a better review if it actually downloads, but it hasn't yet.",1
"I thought this game would fall short to Granblue Fantasy, but it is absolute perfection. A must have!",5
"Well the game is fun, but after two 10x summons my power is 2k and after only a few missions it seems that I am under powered. Usually doing a 10x summon at the start of a mobile game will make you pretty over powered for a good length of time. Also disappointed that there was a 1.5gb download yet each stage still wants a 1-5mb download.",3
Beautiful game,5
"I am trying to do the multiplayer tutorial, but it seems to endlessly load with absolutely no way to skip it. Please fix it.",5
Definitely wasn't expecting this. I was expecting a mediocre game at best. But I am extremely impressed. Nintendo/Cygames has done a great job. Definitely a great game. There's hope for mobile games yet. Keep up the good work!,5
It's going to be lit,5
It's cool so far,5
"Nintendo thank you...This games mechanics are simple and the gameplay was well thought out. I the music is breathtaking, it almost makes you want to dance. We need more games like this!",5
My Samsung s5 could not play this. My dinosaur technology disappointingly wouldn't run the game.,1
Low drop rates combined with horrible vertical only controls and childish characters. Not for me,1
It says tap start I tap start it says server error my phone is a galaxy j7 sky pro version 6.0.1,2
This game really sucks,1
I love the game but so much downloading it kinda ruins the fun a little I only did one map and got hit with a download screen I hate that,3
When I first played this game is seems to have a good storyline and character but I digress on my cell phone it was pretty laggy and the controls are a little bit buggy those things need to be fixed,3
"Bro, this is the game that u didnt know u needed👌",4
Freezing and the characters r all black. Choppy lag unplayable . so disappointed I was exciting to play looks great on YouTube,1
Perhaps it's my phone (galaxy note 4) but the screen goes black but the music and audio still plays. Can't see anything in between tutorial. Slow to load. Really jarring. Either I get a new phone or another update is needed,1
Cant play it because it requires too much extra download space almost a gigabyte and a half,2
One of the best games available on Android platform. Highly recommend.,5
Make the rates for the characters u,5
I'd like to love this game but it won't let me link my Nintendo Id just like the Animal Crossing app. I've tried to ask customer service but they are never any help. And the characters and enemies are just black silhouettes.,1
User Authentication Failed error 500?,3
Game doesn't work at all with Samsung DeX. You'd be better off playing something else. Sorry Nintendo. You fell short in something so basic as keyboard and mouse controls.,1
Awesomeness,5
This game is lost,5
I'm thinking there's supposed to be more to it than just a plain white blank screen.,1
"Yet another game that can't be played on an official Android device. Acer Chromebook 15 is considered ""unauthorized"" and the game won't launch.",1
The best,5
Think you guys can wait till 3:00 to play the game God's help y'all XD,5
Judging from the reviews... I'm definitely downloading. Seems like a great player base at least. I will join in this epic title screen boss match!,5
Not ready to play in pixel 2 XL.,2

Need some help! Can't get past first level. Any guides to get past title screen boss 😒. Seems everyone is stuck.,4
This game is addictive and a great time killer,5
Sorry for the bad 🌟 I want to play and have been waiting for so long. After gameplay I will re-rate,3

This game is garbage and doesn't even play!,1
BEST GAME EVER,5
This game is so good,5
The gameplay is literally the best i ever played in any game nothing can compare to these intense battles with epic music as you go through waves and waves of main menu screens and maintenance notifications i honestly thought it was over for me but then out of no where another maintenance screen came and rescued me and now i am alive and well to continue my quest of loading 999/10 would download again and fun for the whole family ;p,5
Great interactive loading screen 11/10,5
Love the Title Screen music. Can't wait to play tomorrow! ♡,5
I DOUBT THE GAME IS ONLY 98 MB BUT OK,5
It has a good title screen.,5
I can haz game? :(,3

"""The game makes you feel like a title screen"" - IGN",5
Getting a error that my device is not registered to play even though I have installed it twice from the play store.,2
Okay so I get the notification that it's now out and I go to the store and I see what's trending right now and I get scared because I remember I forgot to put the milk away. So I run to the kitchen I run to the 7/11 and when I see the Install button I press it. While I wait for this event I start doing a 360 jump but as soon as I could hit the ground I heard the music from this game and realized I have to wait for tomorrow. GG,4
Put characters in Smash!,5
It's hands down the best game I've played in a while.,5
@Keemstar,5

"Wooowwwww, such an amazing title screen! (Oh, I know you guys are flipping out. Lmfao. You're going to have to do maintenance compensation immediately. Rofl.)",5
Once they remove the pop-up about the servers this will be THE perfect title screen.,5
This is the best screen saver I ever downloaded. My life completely changed because of this app. I stopped being an incel and got a wife and a will to live. Thank you Nintendo for making me a better man.,5
Great coloration. Has a lot of potential!,5
"Gameplay is simple and easy but hard to master clicking that ""close"" button",5
Won't load :(,3
Good game.,5
10/10 will title screen again.,5
SHIRONEKO PROJECT MK.2 SO GUD HEHEH,5
I haven't even got in yet think they're still getting ready I'll give are you a heads up,4
Nice color scheme,5
1/1 best title screen,5
"From what I have seen this game looks gorgeous, but my phone can't seem to handle it. It tells me that my device is able to download it, but it doesn't even go through the intro or anything. My device is android 5.1.1,",5
It says my device is not authorized to play this game.,1
Wow I love Shulk from Xenoblade Can i have more christmas robins tho,5
So far. It's amazing. It's what every game should strive to be. The title screen is amazing and has such detail. There isn't much to do but that's the beauty of this game. 5/5 stars. Keep releasing stuff like this and it'll surpass even Mario himself. Dragalia Lost for Smash Ultimate!,5
"""Ok, this is epic"" -Ben Shapiro (God)",5
I AM BEST PLAYER,5
"5.0 out of 5.0!! Truly a revolutionary game! Already starting out with an unexpected day 1 maintenance, this game is surely slated to be the #1 app of all time!",5
whats up with the music.....,4
Its just a black sceen then a error.,1
If your not playing this your crazy 😁,5
The reviews are hilarious. I'm in tears,5
I am happy to see an new nintendo mobile game I just wish you guys would make the games compatable with every device I still love your games as my child hood is still on going I hope i will gain wonderful memories from this companies games,5
Just a finest piece of art by Nintendo,5
"Truly revolutionary. Loading screens are honestly an underappreciated art form, and by drawing attention to this art Nintendo have truly outdone themselves and I can only hope that smash ultimate has as good loading screens",5
"All i gotta say is if its not 3D+ , I'm out.",5
It good,5
I'm sooooooooooo happy for this game let's do this.........,5
Best game ive ever played 10/10,5
Ama give this for now' waiting for the servers to pop up,4
great title screen,5
Loved this game,5
Best maintenance window popup I've ever seen from a title screen.,5
"Guys, it's here early so that you don't have to wait for it to download once it launches. This is so you can play it the second it is ready. I promise, this is a good thing.",5
10/10 Would love to play again.,5
And this game is not playable until servers are up at 3 a.m. on the 27th of this month and yet there's already 5 Star reviews from 134 players? Fake revews at their finest the games not playable in North America until 3 a.m. on the 27th due to the server's not being completed and they're still making the servers and yet you got five star ratings or any ratings of our one complaining about the issue of the game not being usable at all and has not been usable until the given time that they said when the servers will be put into play so for all the people in North America that's writing reviews on this game rating above 1 * saying that the game even works new Flash it's not even playable till 3 a.m. when they have all servers put in the play and set up so for all you people who reads this above 1 * saying the game is even remotely playable before it's fully released and usable at all I downloaded the game as soon as I got the notification and I pre-registered and yet the game is not usable it's basically saying until tomorrow at 3 a.m. and that's only an estimated time when they get all their servers up and working until then the game is on usable why and they made the game downloadable b4 it's able to be played at all makes no sence u don't put a game out on the market b4 it's even playable this is the 1st time I've seen this where a Gabe is able to be downloaded but COMPLEATLY unplayable do to the survers not up for for at least for 5hrs more isn't common practice before putting a game out on the market to have everything set up and ready to play and sit there and had their own employees rate this app before it's even released come on Nintendo and creators of this game you wouldn't have this issue with Fire Emblem or Paper Mario but a 134 commas people praising the game rating of 5 stars before the games even playable it's easily the biggest self-promoting hogwash I've seen to date from any marketing scheme,1
The soundtrack is fire 10/10 would listen again,5
This is the best title screen I've ever seen 5/5,5
I love the game its quite good,5
Title screen obscured by obnoxious pop-up. 7.8 out of 10,3
"I hate how these games come out, but yet they are still getting it ready. Don't put it out for download in the play store and tell me my pre register is ready, then after I install it, it's not ready wait until tomorrow. I might change rating after it actually comes out and I can play 😠",1
Awesome. Worth the wait!!!,5
A title screen to end all title screens,5
"Truly a work of art. From the traditional red and white ""Nintendo"" screen to the classic black and white ""cygames"" screen, this game immediately caught my attention. I was caught off guard by the animu music and the cherry blossoms in the background. My only recommendation is, although it's fun to press the ""close"" button on the maintenence pop-up, allow us more time to view the background which was given much work and thought.",5
Automatic 5 star just based on the loading screen and how ridiculous some of these reviews are,5
Games finally I waited so long I even pre-ordered it so use any money so I played it and I got used to it real quick cuz it's so fun that anyone can quit it's so easy and I hope you guys play and it's okay and it's also addicting.,5
This game is amazing and fun it's unique and different can't wait to see what's in store in the future.,5
