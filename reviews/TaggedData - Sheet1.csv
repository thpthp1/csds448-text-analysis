"Such a shame that EA took an excellent property like dungeon keeper and turned it into another pay to win, microtransaction filed mobile game. Taking Dungeon Keeper II and adapting it to mobile controls would have been perfect, instead we get this. Save your time.",tag:(p2w)
"Not bad gameplay... buuuuttttt... it has egregious and aggressive Microtransactions, thus becoming a pay to win, pay to move on, seriously you can wait days for 1 block... ONE. I admit I spent a couple dollars on this, but it just wasn't worth it. If this was a full focused dungeon keeper experience, like the old games, but you can pay like $3 and play without problems and on the go, instead of f2p garbage, I could recommend it",tag:(p2w)
If it werent pay to win this would be a great game. But i cant compete in that market so im out,tag:(p2w)
3 words. Pay to win,tag:(p2w)
"Kinda hard to get started, heavy on the pay to win",tag:(p2w)
Basically a cheap iOS remake of the original dungeon keeper with pay to win bonuses.,tag:(p2w)
EA strikes again with Pay to Win. Tournament rewards are a joke. Match making for raids is horribly unbalanced. Not at all like the original version on PC. Shameful.,tag:(p2w)
"I really liked this game. I played basically non-stop for a week, and it's super addictive. But it's also pointless. What is the goal? To build an unbeatable dungeon? If you don't pay to win, that could take months, maybe years. Development is well paced early on, but once you have wait times past 8 hours and you only have 4 imps, you can't really do much. Plus, the constant loading is ridiculous.",tag:(p2w)
A lot of pay to win. The game turned out to be with a pay wall and will push for their gems as often as they can.,tag:(p2w)
"who ever pushed the dragon immortal through quality control was a moron. Pay to win as you can buy a flying immortal early and the game has no answer for it until late game. either buy the dragon or dont play, simple.",tag:(p2w)
Disappointingly pay to win. Excessive wait times extend gameplay with uninteresting mechanics.,tag:(p2w)
"Decent overall. Seems to be a little pay to win, but otherwise great gameplay and concepts.",tag:(p2w)
"Total pay to win dreck. A good rendition of the classic dungeon keeper, but ruined by micro-transactions and timer based events.",tag:(p2w)
"While moderately sorta entertaining, NOT the experience of the original game. Very much pay to advance. :-( the good news is it has made me hunt the original for the PC or try one of its decendants. Why is it soooo hard to find a truly entertaining not pay to win for a phone game?",tag:(p2w)
"Honestly, people criticize this game for its ""terrible pay-to-win"" policy 
with its gems for speedups and such, but honestly, what game isn't? The 
game is fair in my opinion and doesn't force you to do anything. Sure some 
things take a few hours later on but when you're working at a job most of 
the time those hours fly by. And while the gems do make it easier and all, 
you can still obtain them through events and such, and I never felt like I 
actually needed to buy stuff to win, unlike games like clash of clans or 
lords mobile where I ALWAYS felt like I needed to pay to win. Take it for 
what it's worth, but for a legit dungeon making game, I think it's great 
fun!",tag:(p2w)
So pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
A perfect example of EA making pay to win games,tag:(p2w)
Pay to win,tag:(p2w)
PAY TO WIN💰💰💰💰💰💰,tag:(p2w)
"I dislike that it's somewhat of a pay to win game, but I've always enjoyed 
the dungeon keeper games. But I do love it.",tag:(p2w)
Way too pay to win oriented,tag:(p2w)
Horrible game. Beginners have all their resources taken by advanced players unless you pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
It is a good game withoit having all the pay to do anything in it or having to wait literally 7 hours just to remove on plot of the dungeon to put somwthing down. Good at first then just gets tedious and annoying. Plus its made by EA so they live up to their pay to win reputation,tag:(p2w)
This game has so much to offer and it is not a pay to win game,tag:(p2w)
Reminds me of the CD rom game only wish it wasn't pay to win,tag:(p2w)
We want dungeon keepers 3... not this game where you have to pay to win and  takes hours to do something. I wish bullfrog was still around... EA seemed to have ruined this amazing franchise,tag:(p2w)
"This game is funny, addictive, clean looking, fast, not pay to win, and very self aware. Really a great game, my only concern is that I don't know how long it will be until I run out of stuff for my dungeon and it gets boring",tag:(p2w)
"Dungeon Keeper by Electronic Arts for Android Devices... stratedgy game plays great and offers hours of fun. If Android had a AAA Quality  RATINGS playlist on Google Play Store, this would be one of the games listed.  It is not pay to win, if you play smart. I'm suprised EA didn't ask a charge price to download. The modeling of Android games will most likely go through changes sometime in the future. So many people now own some sort of smart device, it seems to me these old models will need to be restructured eventually.",tag:(p2w)
Serious pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
Pay to win or make some progress,tag:(p2w)
"Surprising but nice to see the name resurrected, even as pay to win.",tag:(p2w)
"Reminiscent of Dungeons keeper for pc, with an pay to win system.",tag:(p2w)
"Another EA pay to win game,  not worth it.",tag:(p2w)
"It's pay to win all the way. You can't do much with 2 imps and by the time you save up for a 3rd ( 800 gems ) it's too late, raided by people with units that are nowhere near your level. On the plus side the voice work is solid, graphics are good and its easy to use the controls. Free to try, but plan on forking over real cash to move on.",tag:(p2w)
Alot like the old pc game. Great way to waste some time but another free to play pay to win. My sound is distorted tho.,tag:(p2w)
Another pay to win game,tag:(p2w)
Upgrading building past a cretin level will cost you a lot of real money or time problem is you can't get any gold as you're always being raided. So this game is just like all the other pay to win games. Play if you like frustration.,tag:(p2w)
This game is a massive pay to win game. It is fun but severely unbalanced,tag:(p2w)
Pay to win.  Just got crushed by one count it one mob that flew in.  Not wasting any more time,tag:(p2w)
"If I weren't a fan of Dungeon Keeper I'd have probably rated this lower. It's very greedy. Unless you shell out a good chunk of cash the most action you'll get in this game is logging in to get your imps working on something else. The gameplay is also very pay to win. It's okay when you start out because you have chumps to go up against, but later on it doesn't matter how good of a keeper you are, someone who shelled out some money for boosts will raid you.",tag:(p2w)
this game shouldnt be like thisshoudbe ike the old one where it is an rts instead  of pay to win greedy jerks.,tag:(p2w)
"Nice remake, I'm a little sad that it is a bit pay to win in regards to imps. But it's a nicely done remake of a great game.",tag:(p2w)
"After having my first dungeon deleted, including purchased gems, and never hearing anything from EA. I'm done. Besides that, fun game except that when a single flying champion can lay waste to your entire dungeon its obvious a pay to win game. I've spent over 100 dollars on gems for imps and it makes absolutely no different when opponents simply dig through walls or fly over them with a next to unkillable unit. To call this dungeon keeper is a slap in the face to the fans of the original game. Uninstalling.",tag:(p2w)
I changed my rating to two stars after a year and a half the game is purely pay to win..gotta make the investors happy right? I won't be coming back to this I miss the old DK this game is a terrible representation of the old game.,tag:(p2w)
"I remember playing g dungeon keeper 2 back in the nineties when I was, like, 9. Didn't know it was tower defense, which might be why I never won, but I loved playing it anyway. The app is fantastic, a few changes on how it used to be, but overall great. It's not pay to win, but I will say it's pay to win faster. However, I haven't sunk a penny into this game and I'm still kicking butt in it! If you're patient and don't mind waiting out the build times for traps, rooms, and minions, you're set! 5/5 stars! &lt;3",tag:(p2w)
"If it won't stop updating, clear up space or keep on eye on your app caches and clear appropriately. Not pay to win, it is a fair game.",tag:(p2w)
Just another version of coc.....ugh.  pay to win.  Lame.  Uninstalled.,tag:(p2w)
Fun game but pay to win build gets old fast.,tag:(p2w)
It's OK pay to win is meh,tag:(p2w)
This is a free to play. But it is a pay to win. I think it would be better if you didn't have to pay for the pvp win streaks. Also the pvp match ups could use a little work. For example if I'm not high enough to have anti air attacks. Then I should not have to worry about a player attacking me using an air attack. These air just the fist thoughts. Feel free to contact me for other pointers.,tag:(p2w)
Pay to win. Pay to play. Stick with CoC . Again for 2015.,tag:(p2w)
You took a game from my childhood and made it pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
There will probably never be a game like the first 2 I'd gladly buy the 3rd game for my pc and one so long as it's a set price and not a pay to win,tag:(p2w)
"This is everything wrong with a pay to win game. They took a great title like dungeon keeper and turned it into a ""free 2 uninstall"" disaster. You will need to spend lots of money to get anywhere in this game. Loads of micro transactions and an example of a developer being anti consumer. Basically running a cash grab and disguising it behind a great lineage like dungeon keeper. Nothing like the original and I recommend you stay far far away.",tag:(p2w)
"Was a huge fan of the origional, and this port to the android is perfect! Not pay to win at all!",tag:(p2w)
"Seriously, EA, stop nickel and diming me. Give us a full version of these games with a clear up front cost we can play a real game. And what's with that fake email address with a catch all auto answer? If you don't have a real email don't lie to us.  I played Dungeon Keeper back when Bullfrog Owned it. Why can't I buy games like I used to? Now it's just pay to win...  There are quite a few games like that now. It's sickening. Does EA even make games of their own anymore?",tag:(p2w)
"This game is fantastic for a depressingly short time. One you get your third imp, you're pretty much at endgame unless you pay money or are willing to spend weeks farming achievements. The game wasn't pay to win and wasn't so punishing with wait times, it would easily be my favorite game on mobile.",tag:(p2w)
Pay to win bullshit,tag:(p2w)
Nothing like the original. Terrible. Pay to win game.,tag:(p2w)
"Spent a few days playing, and here's my opinion: the game is definitely designed as pay to win. I don't mind the long build timers, but what turned me off is that you can literally buy extra damage and health boosts for real money. Without gems, you're at a massive disadvantage, even with the same level troops and defenses.  Also, this matchmaking is TERRIBLE!  At 600 trophies (lowest trophy league), I'm getting attacked by players with 2600+ trophies (2nd highest league)! Concept is fun, execution is bad!",tag:(p2w)
"I like alot when it 1st came out,don't  like that you made it a pay to win game",tag:(p2w)
You can get a lot further in this game without having to Pay To Win like you do in Clash of Clans. IMO.,tag:(p2w)
"Just an attempt to make money off an old loved IP. it's like a CEO's idea of a video game.  It's just a Clash of Clans clone with Dungeon Keeper slapped on the front. Don't waste your time, because even if that DID appeal to you, it would take you months to get remotely far in the game since everything is pay to win.  Overall, save yourself the disappointment and go play something else.",tag:(p2w)
"You can't call it micro transaction if it exceeds 5 dollors. You shouldn't  have to pay to win at a game. I want to play the real dungeon keeper, were you don't have to pay more than its real price.",tag:(p2w)
"I loved this game when I had it on PC, but it's become sheer crap when ported to mobile. There are a number of things that totally lower the enjoyment a lot: constant requests to like on Facebook and make reviews, items expensive and requiring hours to make, max. 2 imps unless you spent real money to buy more,  constant and annoying requests to make purchases, et al.  As the saying goes ""Free to play, pay to win"". Oh, also forgot to mention that this is a power hog. It'll suck the life out of your battery as I was left with 15% of my battery after playing the game off and on for only an hour and a half.  Don't recommend as there is no way to get more Imps BUT to make a purchase. Luckily, I still have and installed onto my laptop Dungeon Keeper 2 and all packs/patches. Gets totally worse, though. Made an In-Game purchase of 1100 Gems (had 66+ left) and after purchasing my next Imp for 800 Gems (game didn't give me a free one until after I restarted it), I had a grand total of 106 Gems remaining. For anyone interested, do the math. I got ripped off.",tag:(p2w)
You have to pay to win. Clean it up EA,tag:(p2w)
"The PC version was great, this pay to win version is OK a best, it has potential to do better.",tag:(p2w)
This game is pay to win. do not play this game and don't give them your money,tag:(p2w)
EA is f*%king cash cow have to pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
I would pay 20 $ for a continuation of the original DK series this is a DK skinned pay to win/not wait game. But still ok so far.,tag:(p2w)
Pay to win on another level,tag:(p2w)
"It a free to play, pay to win game. The AI of the mobs is beyond horrible. Trolls and bile demons commit suicide to attack their favorite room on the far side of the map. And in the 3000+ point range, keeping resources is darn near impossible. It stopped being 'fun' a long time ago. Deleting.",tag:(p2w)
Not a bad time killer its still a little heavy on a pay to win game.,tag:(p2w)
"I used to play this game on my computer...I have heard some people complain about how its pay to win but isn't every game? I have more fun on this one than any of the other ""battle/clan""games",tag:(p2w)
"Interesting game play, and a fun follow up to a classic game. However I am not a fan of pay to win.",tag:(p2w)
Make the game cost a fee and take out the gems. The pay to win model is extremely intrusive and a horrible way to play.,tag:(p2w)
"But more fun in my opinion, needs a way to manage buildings better. Its a real pain to rearrange your dungeon. All this talk about pay to win is silly, the game throws gems at you every turn, more so than clash ever has.",tag:(p2w)
"Pay to win, otherwise you can't get anywhere, and elites trample on everyone else....",tag:(p2w)
"Buy the real one if you want to have fun, this is pay to win",tag:(p2w)
Not bad for raping my childhood and leaving me with a pay to win game.,tag:(p2w)
"I loved dungeon keeper on the PC, and this game does a fair imitation of it in a touch environment.  However the greediness of it's pay to win in app purchase system completely ruins it.  The cost of gems is ridiculously high, and if you don't have them you get to play for 5 or 10 minutes every 3 to 8 hours.  If it weren't for this pay to win system being in place this would probably be a fun game that I'd be willing to pay 20 or so dollars for up front.",tag:(p2w)
"I came in expecting to work harder to get anywhere in this game since I wasn't going to pay to win. I thought, ok these gem veins are 4h to dig. Maybe in a day or two I can afford another imp. Then I finished mining and got 3 maybe 4 gems with more then 300 to go. There is no way to play this game at all without paying for every inch of progress. How stupid does EA think we are? I have paid for cosmetic items in games I enjoy to support them, but EA is not getting a cent from me with this scam. Uninstalled!",tag:(p2w)
Would b better if it wasn't PAY TO WIN,tag:(p2w)
"Doesn't meet up to the standard of the old games. Gameplay is VERY slow and rather boring. I did the time and it takes about 2 weeks to reach ONE of the corner mines/quarries with 2 Imps (workers) honestly. I came in with good intentions and the game just feels like a pay to win, broken app.",tag:(p2w)
Free to play? What EA really means is you have to pay to play and pay to win. This game is nothing but a clever way to rob you with its microtransactions. Don't want to buy them? Then good luck doing even the most basic actions in the game. EA is nothing but a money-grubbing disgrace of a company. Totally deserving of the title of Worst Company in America.,tag:(p2w)
More micro transaction bs from ea. Gotta pay to win in this sham of a game.,tag:(p2w)
"Entertaining. Probably end up needing to pay to win eventually. Meanwhile, it will help me waste some time.",tag:(p2w)
"Big DK fan, but this game is no fun. Takes forever to do anything without buying diamonds. At least give us a $5 game that is somewhat playable, I'm soo sick of this pay to win (or do anything) crap.",tag:(p2w)
"I enjoy the humor, and the dungeon creating.  I'm a fan of the old Dungeon Keeper game, and this is reminiscent of that title.  What I don't appreciate is the heavy handed way they present the micro transactions.  I've resisted purchasing ""gems"" so far, but this is blatantly a pay to win game.  Which means at some point, I'll get frustrated with that disparity and uninstall it., or cave, and buy some. :P.    EDIT: Stars lowered until the game starts working again.",tag:(p2w)
Good if you aren't looking for something to actually kill time with.  It would be better if it wasn't so slow to load. Also it would have been better if it wasn't pay to win. I mostly blame EA.,tag:(p2w)
This game requires internet connection 100% of the time. As soon as there's even interference in my signal the game closes back to the start screen and forces me to load for 2 minutes. This is very annoying since I end up spending more time loading depending on my 3g connection. The game is a little bit pay to win and takes a long time to do things later on. Otherwise an interesting idea for a tower defense concept.,tag:(p2w)
Feels like dk. Don't like payment model. Would rather play monthly not pay to win,tag:(p2w)
This game is nothing more than a cash in on an old title.  It also follows the Pay to Win and Free to Wait mentality.,tag:(p2w)
wow talk about pay to win bullshit. I was semi-skeptical about how pay to win until I tried this game. Seriously. The first thing that it barrages you with is spend premium currency! Do it! SPEND IT!!,tag:(p2w)
"I enjoy this game as a minor distraction, but it suffers from having an end goal or any storyline.  Endless building without a way to destroy anything but walls. You are stuck with whatever decisions you make learning the game.  Not a game for those without means to pay. Free to play = pay to win.  Great animation sound runs smooth on nexus 7&5, but takes forever to load. Wish they would take engine or style of this game and make it fun.  A lot of great voicework and sound design.",tag:(p2w)
The game is fun if slow. It consistently loads in the middle of raids causing you to waste all the resources involved for no reward. Very pay to win. Tasks take forever.,tag:(p2w)
Too many micro transactions and pay to win.,tag:(p2w)
Takes a long time.... Seems pay to win,tag:(p2w)
Interesting blend of tower defense and base building. Can see it's a pay to win game. Fun though.,tag:(p2w)
"Finally one of my childhood favorites returns to the world! And on my phone no less! This game is well made, although like all other games of this era it is pay to win. But you could just wait. Excellent game! How I've missed it so.",tag:(p2w)
There are wayyyy too many aspects of the game that are pay to win,tag:(p2w)
"Great! In many aspects, and terrible in so many other. The gameplay is rich and fluid. The graphics and commentary are nice and refreshing. However, the amount of time it takes to construct something or upgrade it pushes you closer and closer to spending real money. The prices are highly unreasonable. If the pay to win factor wasn't strong enough, the disconnecting issues will put you to the brink of quitting. It's a great game, but it is very flawed. EDIT: GETTING BETTER THERE EA! KEEP IT UP!",tag:(p2w)
When it started to take 4days to construct a building I decided to quit. Its another pay to win type of game.,tag:(p2w)
So far I've only done one raid. When I saw the minions taking 23 hours to dig up jems however I started to sweat. The term free to play pay to win is a real kick in the crotch. Nevertheless I hope to revisit a game I barely played before on a friends computer when I was young but I fell in love with it instantly.,tag:(p2w)
Fun 'till it was free to play and pay to win...,tag:(p2w)
Was stoked that DK was coming to mobile platform.  Was very dissatisfied with the way they chose to setup the pay to win system.  For me this game is unplayable in its current forum.,tag:(p2w)
Sad to see the franchise finally return only to join the ranks of the pay to win/enjoy garbage.,tag:(p2w)
"I played the original Dungeon Keeper for PC. This game is a far cry from that game. It's fun to be sure, but suffers from the all too common ""pay to win"" syndrome. I see players who can easily older power me, and yet have strange stats. I know it's their money and if they want to waste it fine. Just wish it was more fair.",tag:(p2w)
Game is 100% pay to win,tag:(p2w)
How many more pay to win games do we need? I'm going back to Impire...,tag:(p2w)
"Dungeon Keeper is pretty blatently trying to compete with Clash of Clans, though the dungeon part allows for more strategy in design and the spells add more interactivity. The microtrasactions are deplorable with 4-24 hour waits for single blocks and blatent pay to win boosts including DK Premium. It insults the franchise it was given with these blatent get rich quick schemes. It's ok if you ignore that fact.",tag:(p2w)
Pay to win and nagging notifications that can't be muted,tag:(p2w)
Like most mobile games this focuses on pay to win and pay to speed up too much.  I'd much rather have some banner ads or just pay outright for the whole game. Makes me want to go play the old dungeon keeper games again.,tag:(p2w)
Enjoying but typical pay to win,tag:(p2w)
Fun in the beginning but quickly transitions into another money sink pay to win game!,tag:(p2w)
Really sad to say it as I was a HUGE fan if dungeon keeper games on the PC. This game is ok. Very slow pace with a huge defensive learning curve. The time it takes to have imps mine out a base that is actually capable of defending itself is too small vs when players can attack you. In addition gaining gems without having to buy them is insane. I have 2 imps and I've been trying to farm gems from mining for a 3rd. I still have 100 to go before I can afford a 3rd. This game defines pay to win atm.....,tag:(p2w)
"This game has caught a lot of guff because it shares a name with an old and awesome pc game of the same name, and really if you wanna compare the two, this is awful, but only because of the mobile formula (pay to win, which really in this game the prices are so astronomical that even I can't bring myself to buy anything) if you don't try and compare them, and just play this for what it is, and if you have even a shred of self discipline and patience you don't need to spend money, its a fun little game.",tag:(p2w)
"I love this game, it brings back fond memories for the classic DK games. However, it smacks of pay to win games where a fellow has to shell out half a ton of cash or snare in all his friends to get anywhere in the game at something other than a snail's pace.",tag:(p2w)
Horrible pay to win,tag:(p2w)
Looks like the original game except for the pay to win feature.,tag:(p2w)
Aside from that your standard pay to win,tag:(p2w)
"See, having to wait days for things? Sure you can raid often, that's great, but I would prefer to have more than just three imps at the point I'm at. That or I'd like multiple imps to work on one thing to cut down on time. Its frustrating the time it takes and it effectively makes it a pay to win game. If I put in the same amount of time as someone with more imps, more imps wins",tag:(p2w)
Pretty much Pay to win...,tag:(p2w)
"Pay to win/play. They totally nickel and dime you to death, they try to divert all negative feedback to some lame 3rd party site. EA had proven one again that they are all about profit and don't care about customer service or freedom of speech.",tag:(p2w)
"It is Dungeon Keeper in a way, but not the game most fans of the series wanted. Every action takes time. And you can avoid the waiting by paying real money. So it can be seen as pay to win as others who invest in it will be further along than someone who does not pay up.   Thankfully I saw a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper in the works called War for the Overworld on steam for those of us who prefer the old games.",tag:(p2w)
"They were truthful in saying the game isn't pay to win, but only because there doesn't seem to be any way to actually win.  Lacking the NPC heroes of previous offerings, this instead gives you other players to invade and be invaded by, a fate you can only avoid by paying the premium currency.  If you are incredibly patient, this game could be fun.",tag:(p2w)
"I used to play this game a lot. The game updates within the app instead of through the play store, which is against android design guidelines and just plain sketchy. Also, pay to win.",tag:(p2w)
"By default, this game will talk to you. As in, outside of when the game is running. This is amusing at first but when it tells you your minions are ready at 1am, it is really irritating.   Also, if you don't want to spam to the world that you are playing (aka don't sign in with your G+ account) it will irritate you with 2 and sometimes 3 options EVERY TIME you start the game. I'm seriously considering deleting this for this reason alone.  The game, while fun, is more akin to backyard monsters and it's ilk than to the orignal dungeon keeper. The voice work is lots of fun and the game play is pretty and reasonably good. I'm pretty sure this is a pay to win game but I'm having fun without spending the huge $$ right now. If I can get past the complaints above, this would be a 4 star game. As is, the waking me up and irritation upon start drop significantly.",tag:(p2w)
"The pay to play method of the game made it get boring very quickly.  Unlike most pay to win games, the grinding need to get the otherwise bought for cash currency isn't balanced enough to be enjoyable.",tag:(p2w)
It's a pretty good game I loved the original dungeon keeper on ye olde windows. The 90 dollar gems or as they put it best value is actually not the best. If you get two 40 dollar and the 10 dollar one you actually get more!! I learned this the first day I played. So not only is it pay to win they have false advertisement about the best value. Really the most expensive gems should be 10 dollars it's stupid to expect people to pay anything over 50 for a free phone game.,tag:(p2w)
"Congratulations EA. You have earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $5.49 each.  But seriously, this game is pay to win trash that disrespects the original Dungeon Keeper license. Avoid at all costs.",tag:(p2w)
Pay to play pay to win super micro purchasing.,tag:(p2w)
Only gives you the option to rate 5 stars within the game.  Also pay to win,tag:(p2w)
"I was excited to see Dungeon Keeper hit the smartphone scene, but less so to see the EA logo slapped on to it. Though it's great to see some familiar faces and play the role of dungeon keeper again, there are some serious short comings. The first being the pay to win strategy inherent in nearly every smartphone game. I understand ""they have to make their money"" but the pricing is ridiculous. Secondly raids and pvp are on par with what you'd find with any SNES or older tactics game. Total time sink.",tag:(p2w)
"Basically, it's a pay to win type of game... if you don't pay, then be ready to wait hours and even days to build your rooms, upgrades or even destroy blocks of dirt (specially those take the longest)",tag:(p2w)
Clearly ripped off clash of clans with just enough different content so they dont get taken to court even more emphasis on pay to win,tag:(p2w)
The in-game rating system is specifically set up so that only 5-star ratings are passed through to the play store. This blatant dishonesty should be curtailed by the app store itself and if not then by users.  The only way to play this game is similar to face book games.   In that same vane this game becomes pay to win nonsense with no appreciable advancement for days otherwise.,tag:(p2w)
"I'd read about all the controversy surrounding the app but still decided to give it a try because I love the old Dungeon Keeper games.  This game only shares a couple thematic elements with the original series, the gameplay can barely be even called ""related.""  This game is just one more cash grab that ruins an awesome ip.  It takes the Pay to Win model and turns it into a Pay to Play model, not that the former was any good to begin with.  This game could have potential but in its current state it is just garbage as doing anything fun requires you to shell out cash. It's truly sad because if this game was closer to the original Dungeon Keeper series I would happily shell out money up front to play it without all of the Pay to Win elements.  Its clear that a lot of work was put into the game; the graphics and animations are pretty awesome.  Too pad the only way to actually play the game, ie have any kind of fun, requires the purchasing of those stupid gems. What a bummer. Let me know when I can pay a couple bucks to to remove all that garbage completely.",tag:(p2w)
"Another terrible pay to win game and money grab by EA. I understand EA is running a business, but if they continue to operate without any regard for the consumer I won't be very interested in any of their products.

"Pay to win models seem to be all the rage, and as long as EA gets money from suckers who say ""It's not that bad of a game"" or ""Quit complaining! The game's free to download!"" they'll keep making these kinds of games. The fact that this game has so many 5-star ratings is a testament to the in-game nefarious rating ""nudge"". It urges you to rate the game 5 stars, but if you click the -other- button, which would rate it between 1-4 stars, it prompts you to email EA, rather than send you to the Play store page.  The art style is good, but since -everything- is behind a paywall, and you are playing against other people who have shelled out real money to get ahead, this game deserves zero stars if possible. I can only hope that enough people give this game a 1-star rating so the industry takes notice: this is -not- how to make an app. Even with ""casual"" gamers in mind, this is a hideous app and should be pulled from the Play store.",tag:(p2w)

Always on DRM Pay to Win Rating manipulation Taking a loved franchise and turning it into a casual game  I've loved Dungeon Keeper franchise since the first one came out.  I saw this app and said to myself ""Finally, a new Dungeon Keeper.""  Instead I find a casual game that is only Dungeon Keeper in minor ways.  Then I see it's pay to win which aggravates me even further.  Finally, I try to play when I don't have a net connection and find out that I won't be playing it without one.    It's a fun little app that, in passing, resembles Dungeon Keeper of old.  If you're looking for a casual Dungeon Keeper and have some money to waste on in app purchases, this is the game for you.",tag:(p2w)
A great lp ruined so EA could pull in money. Unless you're willing to shove out real money to spawn monsters that die near immediately you will have no fun with this.

The in app purchase model they use is very oppressive and borders on pay to win. The app also makes it hard for you to give an honest review from inside the game.

The gameplay is fun and reminds me of the original to an extent. The microtransactions are way overboard though. Save all gems you get to buy imps because imps are just way overpriced and are too integral to the game itself. And as with many free to play games - pay to win is the order of the day. You will have trouble getting into the top 10 unless you are willing to shell out tons of cash.  As a casual game this isn't too bad. Just don't go in expecting Dungeon Keeper.,tag:(p2w)

While adults can see through it children are impatient and may make charges go up. Waiting many hours just to do one thing is not fun especially if it's just for the beginning.

So many ads U will watch ads more than u play,tag:(ads)
Baddest game on the wold I lied I think it is fun to play and also it is an addiction but play it when you are freeand also if there is many ads turn on aero plane mode,tag:(ads)
Would be fun but it's over run with ads...,tag:(ads)

Cringe. And wayyyy to many ads.,tag:(ads)
"To many ads here a star for you,also not offline game",tag:(ads)
the game is good but the too many ads. its killing me!,tag:(ads)
It was pretty great but there is way to many ads and one poped up in the middle of a round which caused me to fail.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads to even enjoy. What a joke of a game.,tag:(ads)
So many ads,tag:(ads)
"Another VOODOO experience. Simplistic design and still awful. I'm pretty sure they're just making these games just to bombard it with just ads, most of which happens to be their own games majority of the time. There is ads in between levels, and it is impossible to clear a level without being forced to watch an ad, not to mention the banners before you start, which I should include the ""watch ad get reward"" system again to this review. There is no menu, no level select, and undoubtedly more ads.",tag:(ads)
Too many ads ..pls stop it,tag:(ads)
"Would have and could have been a great game, but the excessive amount of ads constantly interrupting game play has made this game UNBEARABLE to play. Adverts before, during and after each stage played is just excessive. Then still additional adds to double up on benefits. The latter makes sense, but jeez, the number of ads during game play is just ridiculous.",tag:(ads)
This game is really good but I think there's too many so you could fix that HP crate all the ads and have been going on the past days,tag:(ads)
"Just so you know, to prevent ads, you can turn on airplane mode",tag:(ads)
Really love this game! I'm big brain so who's been suffering from ads please turn off your wifi the ad won't come! #Cube Surfer,tag:(ads)
We are here to play game not for watching ads.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads...... worst ever,tag:(ads)
"I really really like this game but there is far too many ads, everytime you win a level, everytime you fail a level and even half way through a level to get to a bonus! I don't mind ads they sometimes help me pick my next game but in this game it makes a quick addictive game a very slow process!!",tag:(ads)
"Can't play unless you have internet access and to make the ads worse, they've now put them in the middle of the levels. I played one level and had to watch an ad midway and at the end, uninstalled",tag:(ads)
Very bad game and ads,tag:(ads)
I give it a four not because of the game the game is really fun don't get me wrong but there's way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"This is 5 stars cause it's really fun game, if u turn off the Wi-Fi the ads will not appear to this game, i play this at night i play alot but it's very easy to play this, i like this so much, i keep play this to much...

"Geezus. Ads ads ads. That's all there is. And even when you try to turn off wifi, you cant play. Which means this whole game is just a fricken ad. Wish I could give zero stars.",tag:(ads)

So I rate this 1/5 because it's super many ads and your not gonna get any levels because of that ads and I hate this now please don't download this app!,tag:(ads)
Too many ADS,tag:(ads)
I had this app before and it was great and super fun. I completed the game in a matter of days and u really liked it. The reason why I am giving it a bad review is that I downloaded it again this morning and it was awful. There were ads flying in my face and it was very glitchy. And it wouldn't even let me exit the app. I had to restart my phone many times and it was a nightmare. Normally I don't leave bad reviews on apps but this one really got under my skin.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
I like it so much no ads its so cool grapocs are good,tag:(ads)
I hate this game so much it literrqally gives alot of ads AND WHY DOES EVERY APP USES ADS WORST GAME EVER,tag:(ads)
"Is a good game with the usual deluge of ads, which was acceptable but as soon as I got ads mid-game, immediately uninstalled",tag:(ads)
"Too bad the latest update puts ads in the middle of your play. In a game the requires you to maneuver around the board to collect items, having an ad pop up in the middle of it ruins the game. Deleting the app and moving on. It's a shame though. Inwas just getting into the game and would have given it a 4 star review. The thing with the ads just popping up ruins the game.",tag:(ads)
"i think this is a good game but, there is too many ads, its fun but it gets annoying when ur playing and after every two games theres an ad if there were less ads i would give 5 stars :]",tag:(ads)
Uninstalled the day I downloaded it. Too many lags and ads.,tag:(ads)
Definitely recommend this game it is so fun and surprisingly there's no at there's not a lot of ads in there I'm surprised it is so fun 😜🙂,tag:(ads)
you have so much ads 😕 I've got more time watching them than playing the game,tag:(ads)
Used to be an ok time sink but now there's ads every 20 seconds AND you can't play it offline.,tag:(ads)

"CONSUMES HUGE AMOUNTS OF BATTERY POWER !!! 10% WITHIN 15 TO 20 MIN !!! ""UNINSTALLED""......ALSO WAY TOO MANY VIDEO ADS !!! MORE VIDEO ADS THAN ACTUAL GAME PLAY !!!",tag:(ads)
"I used to have a lot of fun until they put ads before, after, and DURING the level, it's extremely saddening, considering i enjoyed this so much :(",tag:(ads)
Let's get a few things straight 1.too many ads 2.u can only get to the top of the stairs once 3.to get things u need to watch an ad Pls fix this!,tag:(ads)
Great game very fun I love the fact that if I turn off wifi I get no ads and the game has an amazing concept I'm only rating 4 stars cause the character and block customisations are kinda dull since they mostly just color change and use normal things alot of games have I feel like maybe doing minecraft blocks would be cool with maybe like among us or other game skins!,tag:(ads)
Billions of ads😡,tag:(ads)
Tired of the ads after every level! That's too much. Uninstalled.,tag:(ads)
Even if you play the game perfectly it's like impossible to get to the top of the stairs it's so frustrating. Also just a heads up you can avoid ads by shutting your data off while you play.,tag:(ads)
Why dont you rename your game to ad game coz after every chance you are giving ads,tag:(ads)
"This game used to be alot of fun, now its giving me ads every 7seconds, 20 second round last 3 or 4 minutes because of ads. Says I can avoid ads by loging in with Amazon prime. Nope! Sorry..was 4 or 5 stars...now 1 good bye.",tag:(ads)
I never played but ads got me in.😎🙆,tag:(ads)

"Really repeative but its fun because you unlock stuff, and there are TOO many ads! there is also this bug that makes the game low quality. Please update this game to a higher standard, Thank You.",tag:(ads)
it has a lot of ads,tag:(ads)
Cool To much ads,tag:(ads)
Game is okay but once you've done one level you tried them all as they're all the same. Ads are also pathetic. They're too long and too often.,tag:(ads)
"Too many ads, the game is poorly designed also as most levels are literally impossible to get the top achievement... Also, it feels like most of the levels are just the same looped again and again - got boring",tag:(ads)
Very nice game no ads,tag:(ads)
Great game but less ads please,tag:(ads)

"Game is litered with ads LIKE EVERY VOODOO GAME, youve got a banner ad, in the menu a big square ad and every two tries youve got a 30 seconds skipable ad sometimes 2, but they are those annoying ads that it takes you to the play store when you tap to close it... 2 stars because its a bit fun.",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads.,tag:(ads)

"Way, way too many, long ads",tag:(ads)
Pretty bad game of course i didnt get any ads because i did something (didnt buy the no ads scam thing or turned off my wifi) but it was decently fun but i realized after playing and messing with the game i found out some things one thing the levels repeat once you get high enough and if you just go home and back to the game over and over again once your going up the stairs at the end your character jumps so you dont even need the amount you need to reach the end just go in and out of the game,tag:(ads)
"Ads, ads before the game starts, ads while playing, ads after a 5 second level. Uninstalled after 2 minutes. Horrible.",tag:(ads)
"Love the game, only one disadvantage too many ads. Adverts every time, after you complete the words that you find...",tag:(ads)
levels hardly increase in difficulty and way too many ads.,tag:(ads)
Soo many ads removed the app on very 1st day I have never reviewed anyone so imagine how much pain it is,tag:(ads)
There weren't as mamy ads as other games which was good. It's a fun game and the levels aren't hard and easily passed. Definitely recommend if your bored a lot.,tag:(ads)
There is too many ads you don't even get to play the game that long,tag:(ads)
More ads than gameplay.,tag:(ads)

"So my friend basically recommended this game to me. No offense to the friend, but she has kind of bad taste, but I installed it anyway. So now I'm addicted. Kinda sad their isn't matching cubes and characters.Like,Santa doesn't have a sleigh cube. Anyway I like the game. But it's kind of pointless after getting all the characters and cubes. Then you just have to max out your offline and cubes. Not sure what that does, but yeah. Also, it only has a sprinkle of ads, unlike other mobile apps.",tag:(ads)
This game is boring and repetitive. Not even getting rid of the ads can fix this train reck.,tag:(ads)
"Lengthy ads and obsessed with data sharing, uninstalled.",tag:(ads)
Game is good but it has too much ads.,tag:(ads)
"This ain't it. 99% 30 second Ads, 0.5% 5 second Ads, %0.5 Gameplay",tag:(ads)
Not very stable it keeps freezing in game or during a stupid ad which is another problem after every level you get an ad not cool voodoo .that being said it's time to delete. Too bad it's really fun too but the ads and freezing up are annoying.,tag:(ads)
I like this game but the only thing I don't like about it is that there are a bunch of ads and I really do not feel like wasting a dollar on some free ad stuff. But other that that I love this game.,tag:(ads)
There is way to meny ads on this app.but its a ok game,tag:(ads)

The amount of ads is a actually overwhelming. Please make it so there's a ad after every 2 or 3 rounds not every round. It will make the game more enjoyable.,tag:(ads)
Its really fun and ads but short and easy to skip,tag:(ads)
Its a bit laggy and a good amount of ads but overall a fun game!,tag:(ads)

This game is a lot of. Fun but there are many ads so I gave it a 4/5,tag:(ads)
"Good,ads are ridiculous tho. Its an ad every time you die or win. 🙄",tag:(ads)
Nothing Special. Cube surfer us your usual mobile game with tons of ads and suboptimal gameplay. The levels aren't very creative. Several times you're given a ton of yellow blocks only to come up against a wall that takes more than half away. The controls are pretty smooth and the graphics are decent quality. It's just nothing that catches my interest.,tag:(ads)
Way too many ads 😒,tag:(ads)
"This is one of voodoo's better games but it still isn't amazing. The gameplay isn't mindblowing but it isn't bad it's just meh. It's not much of a challenge, it's very easy. You'll get ads after every second it feels. 2 out of 5 stars.",tag:(ads)
"This game is so much fun i litterly can't stop playing with it, but there's a lot of ads , buttttt the game is free so you can just turn off the wifi from your phone !💖 I love it ❤",tag:(ads)
I love playing this game and it's a good game but it is not as good as I thought but it is still a good thing and a good game it has a lot of ads but I'm still not going to delete it,tag:(ads)

I like this app but there are so many ads i dont know why,tag:(ads)
"I have not downloaded it yet but I have played this game in my tab this game is superb, amazing and so much fun I love this game. There are so many ads but who cares about it. Who have try this game. There are so many characters and so many different types of cubes. You must try this game. Simly in one word this game is amazing.😍",tag:(ads)
I hate this app there is more take away cubes then gain cubes and ads like ugh.,tag:(ads)
I don't like the ads remove the ads but sos far the game is great,tag:(ads)
"So cool its like i will play it forever,the quality is so smooth and its almost there's no ads!!!",tag:(ads)
Full of large ads. And it make you waste your time with every single stop.,tag:(ads)
"Was a fun game but then I realized there's an ad after EVERY 1 round. And it is not a short ad or 1 u can skip. If u can skip it, it's going to take u to ANOTHER AD, then if the *x* pops up so u can finally resume playing, 9 out 10 times ur just going to get rerouted to the app store where you can buy the game previously seen on the ad u just watched! Not to mention the ad that pops up in a tiny box in on the side WHILE U PLAY. There's so many ads it almost makes me feel like I'm getting hacked.",tag:(ads)
"This game contain no ads , so I like this game",tag:(ads)
Game is too easy and way too many ads.,tag:(ads)
Ads are too long and too often..,tag:(ads)
I love it voodoo is awesome please make more games it is really fun idc about the ads they just trying to make money,tag:(ads)
It's fun but the ads are so frequent that it just isn't enjoyable. You're just watching ads half the time!,tag:(ads)
Come on... ADS after every game!!! Crazy!!!,tag:(ads)
Ok...but too many ads,tag:(ads)
So bad its so hard to win DONT DOWNLOAD you need to watch ads just to get a higher chance of winning not a good game.,tag:(ads)
This is good game no ads its greate game 🙂,tag:(ads)
"Right when I said it couldn't get worse, it totally did. Upgrades are free but are literally purchased with ads. Then every game is concluded with an ad. Every level is about 30 seconds long meaning that even if you don't spend a dime, they're making over 10$ in less than 100 games. The simplicity of voodoo games makes them addictive but the ads are literally making them millions so who cares about quality? I respect them for finding the easiest cash grab possible but hate them for doing it.",tag:(ads)
"This is a solid little game that I found was good for relaxing at night. Its premise is simple, make it to the end without coming up short. I like the sound effects with getting the blocks, the gems, and all that other stuff, and it is challenging at a few levels. The ads are very reasonable as well. I debated keeping it on my phone but decided to uninstall just because it does lack variety after a while although the cube styles and characters are fun. Nice game overall; worth trying.",tag:(ads)
Very bad. Lots of ads,tag:(ads)
VERY BAD TOO MANY ADS DONT EVER DOWNLOAD CANT REACH PINK LEVEL!!!,tag:(ads)
"Way too many Ads, and every level you get an onscreen popup forcing you to give consent to this application for using your personal data.",tag:(ads)
"A 3 star rate. Because when you get to the circle thing that has 2 cubes inside and also the circle has 2 cubes, there is no other way for you not to lose those 2cubes inside. Atleast make it 3 or 4 so that we can collect them but all in all the game is pretty nice and good just fix the ads like plss",tag:(ads)
This game is amazing I got edicted to this instantly there is Bearley any ads which is really good because then it doesn't have an ad in the middle of playing it,tag:(ads)
Terrible and to many ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads every level it's just like: DOWNLOAD NOW when I know the game is terrible. I know that you want money but we can't be having ad ad ad all the time it's really annoying and life is not made out of money you idiots! Thanks,tag:(ads)
Guys i tihg this is so meny ads 🙄 but im not sure,tag:(ads)
There are too many ads but apart from that its very fun,tag:(ads)

This game is too easy for me and too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Overall, it's a really great game. But I have two problems. There are a LOT of ads and there are no challenges. If the game had different challenges and made the game a little more challenging then the game would get 5 stars.",tag:(ads)
I think there are too many ads this game is impossible but it is fun so I would recommend it have a lovely day,tag:(ads)
Pretty nice but needs to put a stop on some ads,tag:(ads)

"This game is bad. Not terrible, just bad. It would be ok if there was no ads and almost good if it was easier to get the x20. Like seriously, i had to get to level 51 in order to get the x20 ONCE. It would also be greater than good if skins were easier to get. Thats my review. Bye.",tag:(ads)
Very addicting at first but gets boring in 10-20 minutes. So many ads.,tag:(ads)

20 second ads after each level. Unplayable,tag:(ads)
"Good game! They don't have a million ads that play at once, so that's already a good thing. The promotional ads for this actually match what the game is like. not the hardest game on earth, but it's actually really fun.",tag:(ads)
This game is very cool for kids like they give may long lasting ads but I love it,tag:(ads)
"This is very addicting! I have to recommend playing with WiFi off to avoid ads though. I understand the devs need money but it is full of them! Each and every level is different and requires skill to create your own path. The upgrades may seem useless, but trust me, THEY ARE IMPORTANT! One of the upgrades adds starting cubes and without that some levels are hard and you need a very optimal route. Overall, it's a good game that requires a good brain.",tag:(ads)
Ads...meh,tag:(ads)
The only reason I installed this app is so I didn't have to keep watching ads about it don't think it's worth it.. UNINSTALL,tag:(ads)
This Game is Great But the bunch of ads but otherwise its great And this is a good game because i use it a lot either im bored i suggest u play it :),tag:(ads)

It was a good game but I didnt like it because it always makes you leave behind so many cubes just when you get the money thing. Its so annoying because there are so many ads. Waste of time and storage.,tag:(ads)
To much ads but cool,tag:(ads)
This game has way too many ads. And no one likes to be interrupted when play a game,tag:(ads)
"This game is terrible. It's just such a waste of time, here's why. 1. If you have WiFi, say hello to billions of 30 second ads. 2. If you are going to get the gems at the end of the stage, they'll place lava or barriers so you get about 6 blocks. 3. This gives you brain damage due to the second reason. So, unless you want your brain cells killed, don't get this game. It sucks and it's a waste of time, just like the Voodoo developers.",tag:(ads)
Too many pop up ads,tag:(ads)
I watch more ads then play the game there is a add before every level and after every level it's so bad,tag:(ads)
Too many ads! That you can't even enjoy the game!!!!!,tag:(ads)
"Having reached level 168 with this game I have made an effort to figure out what this game is about. For one, if your phone is connected to the internet there will be an add in-between 95% of all levels lasting 30s; given that the levels only take around 20s-30s the majority of this game involves watching ads. Secondly, I can confidently assure you that the levels repeat often and rarely result in the bonus. Any positive reviews are most definitely left by developers and should not be trusted.",tag:(ads)
It was good the first couple levels then they stopped getting harder and then around level 20 the levels started repeating. They also have a lot of ads (every game like this these days have a lot of ads so not surprising.) It's a good concept but could of been way better and there is lag on a no wifi game. Like I have no wifi why is it lagging. Anyways great concept could been better that is why it's a 2 star.,tag:(ads)
"Don't waste your time, more ads then actual game play. Then have glitches and freezes, only had the game for 15 minutes and have seen over 20 ads.",tag:(ads)
"Fun but two things . One, on more than one level i have gotten every cube and only gotten x4. Two is there are too many ads.",tag:(ads)
Ads are too long. It takes longer to watch the ads then play the game.,tag:(ads)
Too easy too many ads,tag:(ads)
Fun but too many ads!,tag:(ads)
"Not a good game overall, its just another cheap clickbaity game that HEAVILY relies on ads. To all the people that say 'oh just turn off the WiFi if you don't want any ads !1!1!!' Yes, yes you can do that, but I don't think any game should force you to turn off your WiFi just to not be bombarded by ads. Really stupid for you to say that",tag:(ads)
Its fun but there is TOO MANY ADS,tag:(ads)
Very nice game I did not give it three stars because of the ads not too many ads but still don't like ads. And it doesn't let me skip too,tag:(ads)
This game is trash. The ads are always after each level.,tag:(ads)
Unplayable. Ads every other level it's pointless.,tag:(ads)
"It's a fun game, i didn't mind 5 seconds skip able ads for every few level, but after level 100 it become repetitive because it feels like I'm already done ""that layout"" but it is a new level.",tag:(ads)
Very nice ads app but sometimes you get to play a game in between.,tag:(ads)
"Lots of lag which kills the game. And the few times I had a perfect run, you can't make it to the bonus because there just ate not enough cubes. And an incredible amount of ads. Just thrown together very lazily to have a way to get you to see ads. Not even a splash screen.",tag:(ads)
It is very op game but it ads are very long and unless but we off our internet the the ads will stop then we can play 😉☺️☺️☺️😉😉😉,tag:(ads)
I'd raver wach all the ads to skip it cos it's so anoying I cart get past 13,tag:(ads)
Very much ads,tag:(ads)
No ads in the game amen,tag:(ads)
The ads is too long,tag:(ads)
"It actually a good game, but too many ads",tag:(ads)
To many ads but good,tag:(ads)
"Would put it to 0 but it wont let me. First, the amount of lags. This game couldve been better without ads, second the lags, why with the lag? Everytime i open it always lags. And third, the game. The game is a problem. It shouldn't exist. Im begging you to kick your game to the garbage can. This game is terrible. Do not play it.",tag:(ads)
I would love to give five star but there is so much ads I some time get disappointed because there is only one Ad coming and that is puppy town so plz handle it,tag:(ads)
Not good but not bad to many ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
I like it its very intertaining but what i dont like is the ads remove all ads pls,tag:(ads)
Good game but there is lots of ads,tag:(ads)
Not as glitchy and choppy as it used to be and if you turn off your wifi there is no ads,tag:(ads)
I've always seen this game in tiktok and everytime i watch one its very satisfying and people who plays that in tiktok are good ads for me to play this. And when i did its awsome! I asked my friends to play it too!.,tag:(ads)
Really good app i love it its soooooo fun but please cut down the amount of ads then it would be five stars but other than the ads its an amazing game,tag:(ads)
I feel like all the people in the ads are brain damaged because this game is too easy and there are WAY too many ads,tag:(ads)
this game is fun and all not just because there's no ads but it's because it's relaxing and not that much ads pop up you can play like two to three levels with Wi-Fi and there will be no ads and if there is an ad there ads are very short so that's a thumbs up I definitely recommend to people who have had a bad day or anxiety because it really calm you down and it isn't like one of those games that make you rage over losing. I would definitely recommend ♡♡♡,tag:(ads)
there are a lot of ADS ON THIS it is a good game otherwise,tag:(ads)
Love it but maybe to much ads 🤩🤩,tag:(ads)
I love the game so munch. But the probmlem is all the ads,tag:(ads)

It's very good don't listen to the other people say unistall or too much ads it's very good other people are jealous cause they can't make a good game,tag:(ads)
If you hate ads. Turn off wifi! Play off line with no ads. Use this trick for all voodoo games. ;),tag:(ads)
This was just to easy and the amount of ads is crazy. uninstalled after only two levels!!! Don't recommend!!!,tag:(ads)
"Overall this is a good app, but it's next to impossible to get the jackpot, since when your blocks are High they add an obstacle to make u lose them. It also has way too many ads like bruh :l it also glitches a lot!!! But I guess it's great to play when you are bored. 🙂 3/5",tag:(ads)
"Like ALL your other games, this has an insane amount of ads. Your games are the worst games I've ever seen on the app store and your ads are the center stupidity, they have no thought put into them and just waste peoples time when they play an actual good game. Your games annoy me and plenty others with the absolute horrible and horrid graphics that have no talent or detail, it's like you put no determination and effort. Like, you don't even put faces on your characters and when you do it's bad!",tag:(ads)
It's fun enough for a time waster the ads are annoying after every level but they arent the normal 30 secs but are only like 5-10 secs so they're do able plus didnt try it offline so might not get any then. The skins you can buy are pretty easy to get too so no issues,tag:(ads)
Too much ads and it cheats,tag:(ads)
The game is cool but you spend more time watching ads then actually playing,tag:(ads)
TOO MANY ADS.,tag:(ads)
In this game so many ads i hate ads when complete my level,tag:(ads)
The amount of ads is ridiculous. Seriously. Uninstalled quickly. Not worth it. The levels take 10 seconds but the ads are 30 seconds long,tag:(ads)
Starting from 3rd level I'm getting 2 ads for every level I play. Just not worth it.,tag:(ads)
Games fun to play but it is just the ads they keep on poping up put of no where even when I'm in the middle of the game otherwise from that I would say that I look be the game,tag:(ads)
Too many ads.,tag:(ads)
"Its amazing!,just turn the wifi off so no ads ,very fun I reccomend",tag:(ads)

"Good game but it should have some changes like colours of cubes in pink blue white purple etc. Some amazing levels these levels are so boring there should be background and this game can be more gooder plz do not download it ........ And some features , not good not bad but still I am not happy with this in ads when I saw it , it was looking good but it not good and plz do not download , I got really a bad expenses I will only rate it 1 star by adding the changes it can good from boring Thanks",tag:(ads)
"Interesting concept Not sure how long the game play will stay interesting though A little too many ads, breaks the momentum",tag:(ads)

The game is really good but....there are alot of ads.😔,tag:(ads)
"Not bad, but kinda boring. Actually, I hate it because it's not fpp. You can't retry the level you have finished. There's no account login so I can't save my game progress. And there's no video ads I can play for bonuses. I really don't want to give one star but I hope you see my comment and fix them. Thank you. It's actually not bad.",tag:(ads)

"Soooo I played this game for a day and it seemed pretty ok . But I had some issues . 1. It glitches a lot , it always lags and stops and I get a game over . 2 . Sometimes I can't move it's very annoying and I can't get jems or cubes ! 3 . It gives the same ad over and over again (not a lot of ads though just one) . 4 . After level 89 the game repeats other levels . If you fix these I think it's gonna be a really nice gameplay .",tag:(ads)
More ads than game.,tag:(ads)

"They force you to watch adds just to play your levels, if not that, the game would be a nice time waster, but when adds are longer then game play it's just loads of bull..t",tag:(ads)

Waaaaay too many ads. Turning off wifi helps but not a whole lot. Fun game. Unfortunate that you spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game.,tag:(ads)
Ads. Lots of em.,tag:(ads)
"Turn off WiFi as you get tons of ads which is annoying, it's basically the same thing on each level doesn't even get harder which is a shame. Doesn't tell you what level you are even on and when you collect enough coins and try to level up it just says ""video not available"" where is the watermelon cubes I seen before downloading this game??? All I see for about half hour of playing is yellow cubes",tag:(ads)
First off this game is amazing I do not know why people hate this game if you dont want ads just turn of you connection it's not that hard and other than that this is a very satisfying game to me so yeah,tag:(ads)
This game is amazing there is alot of ads but I suggest to turn off your wifi then they you will have no ads. Before I down loaded this app I read the comments some said that you canrnt get to the bonus bit at the end you can well I could it is a big hard tho but j have only been playing on it for about 3 hours but it is sooooooooooooooòoo amazing I LOVE IT SO MUTCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😆😆😆🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😋😋😊😊😊😉😉😉😆😆🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩 I hope this help you.,tag:(ads)
I like this game very much . I am in 2583 level . So I gave 5 stars . But only think Is there us some ads that I don't like.,tag:(ads)
"I noticed people's main complaint is that the game is made so its not always possible to reach the high score platform. I understand why it's made like that, if you could get there each round then you'd win the ""rewards"" too easily and stop watching ads. I've unlocked all customizables and am on round 123 .. THE GAME IS TOO EASY, this game is built well and is decently fun but it's far far too easy and they don't try and make it any harder. I don't think the levels are constructed to get harder",tag:(ads)
This game is most definitely NOT RIGGED. If you are able to collect 13 cubes till the end you definitely get to the jackpot where you get approx 2.5K gems for sure. I have reached the jackpot 5-6 times since I started playing. Yes there are many ads so please decrease their frequency but it is a fun game. Great job!,tag:(ads)
This games is good but i am 10 high then a wall comes and i will 3 blocks and there are too many ads and this is the easiest and worst game in the world. For this game 🤢🤮,tag:(ads)
Way too much ads,tag:(ads)
This game it's all right kind of fun only problem I really have with it is the ads will drive you nuts for every level is a ad and if you are just playing the game they'll be an ad trying to pop up while you're playing ads ads ads constant ads in order to get power-ups you have to watch ads.,tag:(ads)
It's really laggy sometimes and the amount of ads!,tag:(ads)
Ive seen it on ads and it looks so fun,tag:(ads)
Too many ads and the difficulty doesn't seem to increase,tag:(ads)
10 seconds of play for 30 seconds of ads. Not fun. You spend more time watching other games than playing this one.,tag:(ads)
Is an very interested and suspension game. But I would like to tell you that ads work come in between between. Please do something I requested to you. Thank you.,tag:(ads)
In this game the experience is very energetic and wonderful I really love this game. Jisne bhi ye game banai hai na osko mera headsoff.?,tag:(ads)
Pretty good imo. The only problem is of course ads every 2 levels and the lag.,tag:(ads)
The ads are to much for me and the app seem to be slow,tag:(ads)
Ok this for those who speake bad about this game 1. Always ads solution=turn off your connection. 2. Cant reach end=click restart button and try again 3. Still cant reach end= try a lot hard 4. The game is bad=first download game then write don't write without trying the game 5. The game is hard = u are a noob u don't even know games should be hard so we will enjoy. Thats all of my suggestions. - Thank You,tag:(ads)
This game is amazing! Just amazing!. It is really good for timepass. And in some reviews I saw tht they r telling it is not good bcuz of so many ads. My simple solution is to just turn off ur WiFi or data and then play. It's a good game. Tq,tag:(ads)
This is good game but i see no ads in between i like this game it very good game I give it 4 stars as it is Intresting game 🤗🤗❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,tag:(ads)

Way to many ads. Complete a 10 sec level here a 30 sec add. Opt out of targeted adds here's 30 secs of unskipable adds. Great game but horrible experience.,tag:(ads)
fun you can play it forever yes many adds but to fix that turn airplane mode 0 ads,tag:(ads)
This game is awesome! And if you look it says contains ads and people still complain about ads. What do you expect??? But otherwise I like this game -3- well I'ma go and play this. Bye!,tag:(ads)
This game is really fun BUT I gave 1 star because it is extremely too many ads. Its an ad or two between EACH play . Thats frustrating waiting thru a 25 second preview of another game just to play this game again. And it constantly just cuts off..... #uninstalled,tag:(ads)
"My experience with this ""game"" was horrible too many ads after one level...TEAR.THIS.GAME.DOOOWWNNN!!!!!!!!",tag:(ads)
I really like it not alot of ads and ya I really like it🙂,tag:(ads)
Good . I'm not asking for you not download but if u like lot of ads...no one like ads there are lots of ads after every level.. so my opinion is not to download..but this game is fun u have to collect cubes and if hot another colored cube we lose so this interesting but the only thing is ADS...!,tag:(ads)
Too much ads,tag:(ads)

"This game is very boring, way too many ads, and just overall sketchy and laggy",tag:(ads)
"Too many ads, after every single level and even randomly while im playing :( at least u have to let me play each level without interruption.",tag:(ads)
It's a pretty fun app but it's not that hard actually not hard at all yes I do understand theres alot of ads after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL but theres a lil trick that stops it just turn off your wifi or/and mobile data! Boom better overall the app get a 3 star,tag:(ads)
Ads are so annoying,tag:(ads)
Too many forced ads,tag:(ads)
Nothing to an interesting game and lots of ads,tag:(ads)
It's fun but you watch more ads than play,tag:(ads)

"Repetitive, way too many ads.",tag:(ads)
"You developers have got to stop with the ads after every single level. This game doesn't even have that much content and it doesn't spike in difficulty. Once you get all the upgrades, it's just the same thing over and over again with an annoying ad after each level. I'll watch ads and give you guys free money if you build a good game around it but you're gonna have to try harder than this.",tag:(ads)
I like the game but there's way to many ads,tag:(ads)
I would love this game if it doesn't have to many ads.,tag:(ads)
I lvl it I give it three star bc it' has a lot of ads,tag:(ads)
I got this game to stop the godawful ads. You have my download stop taking my time up.,tag:(ads)
Disgusting amount of ads. 30 second ad after every level. Ads are longer then the levels themselves.,tag:(ads)
"This is an amazing game. I enjoy playing it. I have read in some comments that there are so many ads but my solution was to turn of the WiFi. Some people also said that we never reached the end where there are alot of diamonds, and my advice to them is to have good sense and to use ur brains cause I reach that part a thousand times. * DUH*",tag:(ads)
No way to get the bonus at the end... Just there to tease you. And the ads... Good LORD the ads! Spent 10 min on this game... 7 of them were watching ads!!!,tag:(ads)
I like the game. Its fun and time passes while I play it so yeah. Main reason I got was because I was tired of seeing ads for this game and people not even trying. Also I was waiting to get it for a while.,tag:(ads)
"VERY FUN! BEST OFFLINE GAME EVER! This game is really fun and epic and cool and very satisfying when you collect blocks. 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 Really fun game and super easy to play, if you turn off wifi you get zero ads. **SUBSCRIBE TO PigsForLife Draws and PigsForLife Studios on YouTube**",tag:(ads)
The game wonderful ☺️ and there are no ads there are many levels the game is not so much hard also it is amazing,tag:(ads)
"I really dont get it, why when you lose you put the option to skip qith an ad BEFORE continue comes up. I just cant beleive how money hungry you stupid people are. Why the hell do you have to wait an eternity before you can hit the no thanks. And you make the skip button move around and stuff so its flashier so you click it. That also explains why the ""no"" button is BARELY visible, you make people think the ad is the only option. Gameplay was okay, thats why its a 2 star. also to many ads usual",tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)
Fun concept sure. The game would be great but an ad after every level makes me just uninstall the game itself. Not surprising anymore since voodoo has the most ads of any game out there,tag:(ads)

Nice game I like it but to much ads,tag:(ads)

My gosh advert after advert which is fine as you need ads to have a free game but 30 second adverts just takes all the fun out of it and becomes hard to watch,tag:(ads)
I love this game and it's not that laggy than your other game but if you don't want ads popping up everywhere you need to turn off the WiFi all the bad ratings that say there are too many ads then you should turn off the WiFi and some of the levels are the same but that's OK and I've got through the gems like 4 times and I'll make sure I'll go go through it 100 times but you should also add new skins and cubes it'll be fun if you do an update but I love this game.i unlocked all skins,tag:(ads)
"Like most games, fun concept, poor execution. Sudden ""lag"" at important sections feel like bad design at best and intentional screwing you over to get ad views at worst. Also, mandatory ads on top of optional ads is always a bad call in my book.",tag:(ads)
I like this game i give it a five but when i do the chest thing i get alot off ads and i gotten all the cubes and people and i would suggest putting more stuff :> but i love thr creator also,tag:(ads)

No matter what you can't get the jackpot at the end, the restart button doesn't restart, rotating blocks are timed so you have no choice but to hit them, etc. On top of that there's an ad every other game, yet you can't watch ads when given the option to to get extra rewards, it just says ""video isn't ready.""",tag:(ads)

You are really good at making up new ways to make me hate ads more.,tag:(ads)
It is nice but there is only two problems. That is why give it only 3 stars. First issue is that problem is if I collect all blocks except 3-4 than also we will loose and second issue that if we want to skip because the level is too hard so we have to see an ad and normally also too many ads interrupt us . Please think about it 🧐🧐,tag:(ads)
Ads is too much that's y 1 rate otherwise full 🌟..,tag:(ads)
I love the game and its very easy game and i now its have a lot of ads!!!!!!,tag:(ads)
Best game for timepass and here's a tip thank me later for this : if u get annoyed by ads so just turn your mobile metwork off when it needs to be sipmlee because it's offline game ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,tag:(ads)

It's okay I guess but it's full with ads and it's hard to get out of the lava and it's hard to get different cubes so it's best you delete the app to free space or save your space for a GOOD game,tag:(ads)
Horrible I couldn't even play the game the game was sooo glitchy I wish I could give it a 0 star I advice to not get it I sucks I had so many ads. And it glitched my whole phone. I HATE THIS APP,tag:(ads)
guys do not use. too much spam ads.,tag:(ads)
"I find it extremely suspicious that the highest multiplier I've been able to get at the end is 11x, even collecting all the blocks I see and losing the least number possible at each obstacle, yet the ""jackpot"" is a couple steps higher than that. Seems like a ploy to keep you playing and watching ads with little actual reward.",tag:(ads)
Very repeatetive and an awful amount of ads.,tag:(ads)
This is game is really fun and the quality is great its not slow at all although there are ads but there are not a lot of ads they usually come in after your done playing mainly if you lose but the game is great recommend for ages 6 and up,tag:(ads)
Awesome game just way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Fun, but WAY too many ads! One after every level, so about every 30 seconds. Uninstalled.",tag:(ads)
So fun The ads are Annoying But I still like the Game,tag:(ads)
Its fun but ive had it for like a day BUT i have played for like a few hours and its literally IMPOSSIBLE to get all the way up the number thing. Like i played and got all the cubes and hit the lowest stack of red blocks and i still only got to the ×10 thing. Its really annoying but the app is decent. It has only a few ads here and there and thats better than alot of apps. But other than that its pretty fun!,tag:(ads)
I was told from another review that you have a choice whether or not to see ads by clicking to watch but was a lie,tag:(ads)
The ads make this game unplayable. I spent more time watching ads than actually playing. It's faster to shut down the app and reboot it than watch one of the ads they play every 20 seconds,tag:(ads)
More time watching ads than playing,tag:(ads)
"The best game ever for me. So addictive,relaxing,though there are ads bit not that much that would make you hate it. Some And Relaxing",tag:(ads)
Too many ads on Tik Tok,tag:(ads)
I like this game very much it have not ads......and much fun. We play it and we really feel that it is a funniest game. I like this game soooooooooooooo much.,tag:(ads)
"Not very good I've been playing this game for roughly a day, but it's mainly as a background game when I'm bored. It is a pretty cool concept and works as a great flash game. However For a game about making precise turns and precise movements, this game is way to laggy. It will stop midway through the game and will just kill me. It also gives you no incentive to play. There is unlockable runners that need ads to unlock, and cubes that take at least 34 levels. The game itself is just terrible",tag:(ads)
"Ads between runs=1 star Puttings ads at the bottom is whatever, but if an app has the dumb scheme of a 15 second or more ad between EVERY SINGLE RUN, I give 1 star. Also, 3.49 is too much for ad free. $2 or less, stop kidding yourselves. This game can be won overnight by just purposefully watching ads as well. An average run nets you 30-100 gems, while watching one 30 second ad nets you 1,000!!!!",tag:(ads)
Way too much ads,tag:(ads)
ADS but funny,tag:(ads)
I think you have a game in your ads..,tag:(ads)
Very Bad Game so Many Ads This game pls dont download this game 🤧,tag:(ads)
Too many ads.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads while playing and also its progression heavy ad based. It's a shame because it seems it would be a great game.,tag:(ads)
This game is great! I recommened it to my husband and he loved it! And hes really picky and tempermental! The ads get you subjected to a lot of new things so I don't see why people wouldn't like ads. If your mentality is older than your age this game is great for you! Keep cube surfin! 🤗,tag:(ads)
Too much ads totally disappointed 000,tag:(ads)
Uhmm this game is super laggy or its just my phone device or it could be the game but there is no ads wich is kinda good but a u now its sucks i was gonna give it 5 starts until i clicked a button and an ad showed up i accidently clicked it because it went soo laggy cube surfer more like cube suffer!,tag:(ads)
way too much ads,tag:(ads)
Ads suck ro many ads just want to play the game,tag:(ads)
So many ads. Theres no point in playing this game because you spend 80% of your time watching a fricking ad.,tag:(ads)
It is a cash grab do not play this!!!!!!! Ads!!!!,tag:(ads)
I loved this game at start but once i noticed that there is an option up that support us by giving access to mobile data. Like I dont wanna do that and the main thing that annoyed me the most was that i used to click the cross on the right side of that option and it appeared back and after being annoyed i clicked the button to access my mobile data and they started asking for personal info thats why I had to delete this game one more reason is that there are a many of ads. Please try to improve,tag:(ads)
Ads make it absolutely unplayable,tag:(ads)
This game is great if you dont mind watching ads every 30 seconds. Super annoying.,tag:(ads)
"Most satisfying game ever! This game is good for any time and it has no ads unless you click on a video. You might get glitchy sometimes but I think that's just my phone. This game is awesome! Get awesome cubes to surf on and different skins to play with. For once, this game is exactly what it says in the ad. This game deserves a 5 star rating and you should download very, very soon... or now",tag:(ads)
NO ADS,tag:(ads)

"Fantastic game, works offline, few ads! VOODOO has really changed, in a good way!",tag:(ads)
Nobody should ever install these 2020 or 2019 games they are so much more worse than fruit ninja jetpack joyride and subway surfers etc. Also too many ADS i beat 1 level and I get a ad and the levels are like 15 to 30 Seconds long that's my review on this game the only good thing about it is it's pretty satisfying and there's some gameplay other than that I don't like this game,tag:(ads)
Nice game I give this five star becouse there are no ads sooooo nice game It is so lovly,tag:(ads)
VERY DISAPPOINTED! Every single time I play a stupid ad shows up and its very annoying that they'll say like wIn tHis lEvEl iTs eAsY ITS NOT I TRY to beat this stupid level but it's just weired to boost people's confidence by giving them the ads and then giving the opposite of what you want I'll be deleting this app pretty soon. Don't install it terrible terrible terrible.,tag:(ads)
Fun but to many ads.,tag:(ads)
Deleting. Had it downloaded for less than 10 minutes. Only downloaded because the top comment said there were rarely ads but i got 5 30 second ads within that time. I forgot why i dont download free games.,tag:(ads)
This is a boring game whenever you download it loads of ads come on I just don't like it,tag:(ads)
Too many ads. You get an ad after almost every level even if you dont hit the skip button. And the rounds only last maybe 20 seconds. Its annoying.,tag:(ads)
"Cool concept, barely fleshed out and attached to shameless adware. Ads after every level. Ads at the bottom of the screen. Ads to level up or get currency for some lame reskins. The gameplay is just, slide left or right to pick up currency and blocks to pass through the same 4-5 obstacles that are just rearranged for every level. No increase in difficulty, just repetitive gameplay designed to feed you into ads. Not worth the time it takes to download.",tag:(ads)
I think it could be better. Personally I would stop playing ads everytime I pass a new level and make it so that you dont lose almost all your cubes in the lava. I don't recommend this game.,tag:(ads)
This is fun but lots OF ADS WHY SO MUCH ADS,tag:(ads)
"Decent idea, but the levels are short as 🦆 and there's a 10-30 second long ad after EVERY level. More time spent with ads than the game.",tag:(ads)
So much ads do not recommend,tag:(ads)
Good game but ads were too pervasive ruining it. Game was fun and solidly designed.,tag:(ads)

This game fun becuase i can watch ads means that i can take breaks,tag:(ads)
Simple but fun gameplay that screws you over even if you played a perfect run. Ads after every level get annoying.,tag:(ads)
This game is fun but when you go into the lava most of your gems get taken away. And there is no reason to have gems after you get to the max level. Also there are alot of ads. And the same levels get repeated over and over again. I would not recommend this game to anyone.,tag:(ads)
Holy man there are a lot of ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
Ads suck,tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Way too many ads. An ad after every game, an ad for every optional action, and even if you take the optional action you still watch another ad after the level. There was even a few times where I had to watch multiple ads in a row before I just gave up and uninstalled.",tag:(ads)
Toooooo many ads,tag:(ads)
I like this game but so many ads,tag:(ads)
Goodish but there is SO MUCH ADS I get 1 every 20 seconds it's annoying!!,tag:(ads)
"I was very excited to play this game for a time killer, but after about two levels it would play me a 30 second unskipable add even if I died it would play and add even though I didn't press the skip button. I really was disappointed in the amount of ads please remove them. I deleted this app so sorry.",tag:(ads)
"Super fun, but 2 ads after almost every single level.",tag:(ads)
So much ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads. An ad after every level makes the game worthless.,tag:(ads)
It's really fun and it has none ads! Install it right now!,tag:(ads)
"Way too many ads, levels repeat, nothing to purchase with the gems you earn except 9 skin and block packs. One of the worst games I've ever played as far as ad frequency, was a 15-30 second video after every level that you couldn't skip.",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
ok game and as usual tons of ads. delete.,tag:(ads)
"Shallow game, just for ads",tag:(ads)
"Each level is no more than 10 seconds long, and it just cycles the same few levels over and over. On top of that, there is an ad between EVERY SHORT LEVEL. Its junk. I might be able to deal with the obnoxious amount of ads, if it didn't keep giving me a black screen. I keep getting a yahtzee ad, which is a full minute long, that you have to click to get the timer started, then you have to click to end the ad, which gives you a black screen and you cant play anymore. Screw this. This is junk.",tag:(ads)
Maybe try putting in more ads cuz the 10000 you get every minute is not enough,tag:(ads)
The ads seemed a bit bad but the actual gameplay was amazing. Highly recommend to those who need a game to cure there bordem.,tag:(ads)

"Your average game from Voodoo(a suspicious chinese company known for data trafficking) that doesn't give you ads at the beginning to make you want to continue giving your personal information to them,then as you progress there is more and more ads,and it gets to the point where you literally can't play anymore. Low effort and the levels are made hard on purpose to make you watch more ads to get past them. I don't reccomend this game at all if you do not want your personal data stolen or time",tag:(ads)
The game is okay but there are WAY to many ads! I find that a lot of games by VOODOO are full of ads,tag:(ads)
The game is fun but it is mostly like an ads simulator. So many ads.,tag:(ads)

"The game is extremely fun but the amount of ads make it unbearable to play. Every 2nd turn you're forced to watch an ad even if you decline extra crystal bonuses, and these ads you need to click X on twice so it almost feels like two ads.",tag:(ads)
This game is fun but terrible at the same time it is incredibly difficult to get to the part with all the purple gems. Every time you get alot of the block things it finds a way to take most of them away which ticks me off. My experience with ads in this game is horrible after every level I get ads. The concept of the game gets boring after awhile and sometimes kicks me out of the game. 10/10 would NEVER download again.,tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)

There's not to many ads the retry button is fine and the game is brilliant cuz there's not to many ads ppl that say there are it's their device or sum thing and I haven't got one glitch in the game I've enjoyed it and I have no complaint 👍🏼😊 and I read the comments to so I reply as..... THE RED BLOCKS ARE FOR A CHALLANGE AND ITS NOT THE SAME ITS DIFFERENT U HATERS YH U BETTER THINK SMARTER CUZ UR FALLIN BACK And if u lose every time ur bad at the game lol😂😂😂😂,tag:(ads)
Umm it is very good and amazing but it keeps doing ads!!! even tho i did not click the ad button for free prizes!,tag:(ads)
Omg I hate this game!!!!! If your here to challenge yourself be prepered because to make it to the bouns end thing is impossible! I literally grab all the blocks possible do everything correctly and I still couldn't make it! Also there are soooooooo many ads it's insane like come on! If your looking for a fun easy game I suggest you go somewhere else just saying! Have fun and enjoy this terrible game!,tag:(ads)

"This app is a prime example of mobile shovelware. - Ads; they are thrown out you as often as unity allows, and cycles between numerous providers to ensure maximum profit. This leads to unskippable long ads and forced max-volume music. - Gameplay; inherently unfair. Game purposely lags when collecting large amounts of cubes to force you to lose out. Additionally the lava trap is coded to take a percentage of your total. - GDPR; Not followed at all. Expect to lose control of your data.",tag:(ads)
It's a great game to play offline and when your bored. Theres not a lot of ads which is good for me coz I like deleting apps that have to many ads in🤣,tag:(ads)

"Ad pop-up after every stage that takes about 15 seconds is an interesting tactic to say the least. Thats 4 ads a minute, 40 per 10. The ad being 20-30 seconds at least means you for every minute of game play you watch 80 to 120 seconds of ads. You decide whether its worth it.",tag:(ads)

"Levels repeat after the first 20. The shortness of the levels and the sheer volume of the repeated levels means you're going to get a ton of ads. Only good thing is that you can get unlockables by simply playing the game and it doesn't take forever.

Game sucks. Glitches out and not able to get to twelve at all. And you get ads every single time you finish a level. And the levels just keep cycling through the same five stages. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!,tag:(ads)
Too many ads and it lags when you pick upp alot of cubes at once,tag:(ads)

This is the worst game every time i complete a level it there always a ads. Cut down the ads and every game u make,tag:(ads)
This game among all other games created by the same people this game has a good concept but doesn't run as smooth as it should where as at times you will not move when you want to or you'll move and it will still manage to take cubes away from you game has not an unreasonable amount of ads but still annoying at times because every other level theres an ad so otherwise this game is fine but at times very unfun to play.,tag:(ads)
could be a great game. but they only made about 5 different levels that you just keep playing through over and over. if you turn off your internet there is no ads other than that after every 5 second track you watch a 30 second ad. wish the developers would have actually cared about this game as it could be a great game.,tag:(ads)

"This game is actually really fun! The only time you really get ads is when you click to watch one, so thats good! I just rate it four stars because it could have more. It's also laggy, but that could just be because of my device. When I die, the retry button takes forever to pop up, so thats a small problem. But other than that, its a fun app and I recommend it!",tag:(ads)
This game is the best download it it's the best yes there are ads but that is because they are trying to show their games to other people to make their business grow and also the same with shopping ads they are trying to make money for their business bit back to the game it's the best and I would recommend to other people but everyone has their own opinion and sometimes I would agree with that but this game is the best and amazing I love voodoo and have some of their games on my phone,tag:(ads)

"Good concept, Terrible implementation. Levels just repeat, too many ads and you literally can't beat all levels with a good score. Even if you collect all cubes and don't lose a single one, you're still not able to reach the x20 goal. So skill doesn't matter at all on this game.",tag:(ads)
Too many ads. Thats how all vodoo games are,tag:(ads)
Love this game but the ads,tag:(ads)
It should not be downloaded it takes forever it took it like 3 days and ads like every second 😒 🙄 😑 😐 😕,tag:(ads)
"Too many ads, unplayable. Uninstalling this junk!",tag:(ads)
"Support us by letting us sell your data! Huge banner that constantly reappears at the top of the game, every time you play it. Ads that you can't close or skip. Far too aggressive for my liking. Could be a decent game without those annoyances.",tag:(ads)
Great game! Fun with hardly any ads,tag:(ads)
Fun game but can never make it to the top. Repetitive and gets boring easily. Way too many ads. Great idea but not made well. Don't recommend.,tag:(ads)
Like it very calm. But it is full of ads every level you finish there's an ad. So if u install it then turn off your WiFi,tag:(ads)

Too many long ads.,tag:(ads)
"I only ever play these because the people playing them in the ads are dumbest people on the planet and I want to seem better than them despite them not being real people and just being a way to show that a game is hard. I'm pretty sure that's what they're going for which 5 personal stars to that but overall, these games are just ones you'd play on a roadtrip or something as a way to pass the time.",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Should be renamed to ""Ad"" surfer Horrible cash grab game. Made overnight just to show you ads.",tag:(ads)
I love this game i think its the best game ever and its one of my favorite games but there is lot of ads,tag:(ads)
Devs are more concerned with cramming ads into the app than making it run. Literally cannot play it for more than a minute because ads try loading and crash the app.,tag:(ads)
Don't waste your time. More ads than gameplay,tag:(ads)
"Its OK I guess. But after playing it for 2 hrs or so, it got slightly repetitive, but fairly harder. Try it if you want, it just wasnt my type of time killer game. Oh, and there are quite a lot of ads....",tag:(ads)
Super laggy and to many ads,tag:(ads)
TOO MANY ADS!!! This game is ok but an ad after every level is abit much especially when each level is an average of 20/30 seconds long. Level are very much the same too. This is why i am giving it one star and uninstalling.,tag:(ads)
The game is pretty bad. I like the skins and the gameplay is kinda fun but the level design is garbage. You just play the same few levels over and over again and some of them aren't even possible to get the highest score from my experience. Overall bad game. Took me like an hour and a half to unlock everything and then there is nothing left to do. It probably would have taken me 5 times as long if I didn't turn airplane mode on to block the ads. Don't waste your time on this bad game.,tag:(ads)
this game is really satisfying to play but theres too many ads and it gets annoying real quick,tag:(ads)

"This game was fun at first but then I realized that the levels were being repeated. And there was SO MUCH LAG AH I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN! My phone blacked out for 10 minutes and kept freezing beacause of it. When you get too many blocks the screen starts flashing black..and how could I forget the ads? There were litterally ads after EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. Don't waste your time installing this, just- don't even bother-",tag:(ads)
Trash game too many ads,tag:(ads)
It was good but too much ads,tag:(ads)

I'll put it to 5 if the ads are fixed I'm forced to watch them for no rewards but when I live I on watch ad to start with extra block theres never a video available,tag:(ads)

It is easy but the ads are too much and it keeps repeating I don't recommend this game 😒,tag:(ads)
Lots of ads turn on airplane mode and they go away,tag:(ads)
It's one of those games where you're viewing ads more than playing the game. 🤷‍♂️,tag:(ads)
Fun bur ads,tag:(ads)
This game Has alot of ads and well l can't never win the gem place even my blocks are tall they keep getting short because of the Red blocks what's the point to win if you're just going to lose again and again because the of Red blocks I can never win this game it never lets me win even if collect a lot of blocks until it's tall still because of the Red blocks I can't even reach the gem level sorry to let you down but I have to give you a two-star or three by the way I'm not an adult I'm a kid,tag:(ads)

Fun game with good controls and a nice simple style but way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"This game was fun for about 30 levels that I played in 2 hours. It's repetitive, the levels never get longer or harder, ads are out of control typically there's one after every level, and out of 30 levels I only reached the top once despite collecting every block. Got boring quick. I won't play for 20 seconds just to watch a 20 second ad. I would pay to remove ads but game is same every level. Don't bother downloading!",tag:(ads)
Lot of ADS !!!,tag:(ads)
This game sucks. There are wayyyyyyyyyy too many ads and this is just a dumb game overall,tag:(ads)
"I can't ever win. The game is super repetitive and it's constantly giving ads. The game basically forces you to lose almost all your blocks so you can almost never reach the top. Skins are also very expensive. The game overall is just another cheap game that gives you ads non-stop, but it can be fun or a simple game to pass time.",tag:(ads)
Ad between every level. Watching ads more than actual game play,tag:(ads)
Your game is cheater because in ads i saw higher and higher the block i going to delete this game on my phone i hate it the blocks is just in 5 levels i think you need to stop making games like this.,tag:(ads)
TOO MUCH ADS IT'S SO ANNOYING,tag:(ads)
Worst game I ever played when u press retry u always get ads. And the levels are impossible to do,tag:(ads)
Too many ads every round you get a dumb ad if this game only had like one bottom ad it would be great but just like all other dumb voodoo games this has too many stupid ads.,tag:(ads)
"A lot of people complain about the ads, but i turn off the internt and the game is amazing!",tag:(ads)
"0 stars if i could! Very laggy, too many ads, etc. I hate this game",tag:(ads)
Tired with ads,tag:(ads)
"I really dislike that there are so. many. ads! On to the next level? Sure, watch this 30 sec ad first. Oh, you died? Watch this 30 sec ad that you have no choice but to watch first. Oh, you don’t want any ads? Pay me nearly £4 then. You may as well have to pay for this app! :((",tag:(ads)
"Ads were infuriating, I understand you make your money with ads but the frequency was really out of balance. I had 3 games in a row with ads immediately after. Also, I levelled my blocks up an noticed on multiple occasions that after an unavoidable obstacle (lava) I was left with the number of blocks I started the level with, so if I hadn't leveled it up I would have died. So either you have to level up to complete certain levels of the game purposely reduces your block to minimum despite level",tag:(ads)
"too many ads, not fun",tag:(ads)
"Way too many ads, after every level, and every level lasts under a minute.",tag:(ads)

I would say 5 but the ads are annoying there's this ad that takes so long to skip and there are like too much when I even try to upgrade it's a ad,tag:(ads)
"One of my favorite games to play! Awesome way to pass time, and just REALLY fun gameplay! There are barely any ads, and you can play without being interrupted. The levels can be a bit repetitive at times, and I do wish there were more characters. Despite that, the game itself is GREAT! I play it CONSTANTLY, and DEFINITELY recommend installing!",tag:(ads)
Horrible amount of ads. Played one time and was forced to watch a video of another game. No thank you. Uninstalled.,tag:(ads)
Fun casual game. got ads but all of them are just 5-second-skip ads. The x20 bonus are impossible to get. most of the levels are designed specifically so you wont get the x20 bonus. You can see the bonus there but you wont ever reach it. its like looking at the grand price in a carnival game where u know u will never get it. feel cheated. even after u have upgrade your cube to max. it is still impossible. im at level 56 now and only get the x20 twice,tag:(ads)
Ads are annoying,tag:(ads)
Paid for no ads.. Still got ads which is ridiculous. A game that initially seems entertaining then descends into constantly crashing and being no longer enjoyable because it is so cluttered with frigging ads.,tag:(ads)
Ads are longer than any actual gameplay,tag:(ads)
"Your average cash grab, no effort mobile game. The ads make it seem like the game would go on forever until you mess up like in Temple Run but you're just playing a short level over and over and for that reason I'm flagging this game for false advertising. The idea of the game is fun but having to see an ad every time you finish a ""level"" ruins the game. This game is bad, waste of time and money if you spend anything on it. To the developers, don't make another game like this, please.",tag:(ads)
"I like this game,but.... The problem is so many ads every levels & in upgrades like once you upgrade it to coins next upgrade cost ads u kidding",tag:(ads)
"This game makes absolutely so sense, give us more blocks,stop with so may ads to not pay for it and other stuff you have to fix for it to be good I'm un downloading this.",tag:(ads)

"A good idea, implemented in a poorly designed game, full of ads",tag:(ads)
Do not get this a bit once you to lose so you watch ads please don't get it,tag:(ads)
Was fun at 1st till it started lagging and wouldn't let my character move half the time even though I clearly had my finger on the screen and ads wouldn't stop popping up every time I either passed a level or went into a different part of the game.,tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)
Horrible. The levels are impossible and the ads are so annoying and frequently popping up.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads. Every 1 - 2 levels there's another advert.,tag:(ads)

Too much ads.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads..its obnoxiously annoying,tag:(ads)
Game is a fun time killer but the amount of ads is outrageous. These guys are wanting to charge you $4 to get rid of the ads when this game isn't even worth $1. Gonna uninstall just from the sheer greed behind this pay to play game.,tag:(ads)
On the ad this game is way different and better but in the game it's trash! I can't drive no coffee without dieing I really hate it not recommend. Also to many ads,tag:(ads)

I really like it there are ads but it is very fun.,tag:(ads)

A ton of ads,tag:(ads)
30 seconds of gameplay followed by 30 seconds of ads. Every level is short and similar. I played for 1 hour on airplane mode and beat enough levels to collect every skin. The only purpose for this game is to push ads on kids.,tag:(ads)
wow.just wow. this is actually good game and way less ads then I was expecting,tag:(ads)
Paid for no-ad but the ads still show up,tag:(ads)
"This game was fun until the update. After the changes it became a boring time killer. The sliding scale sucks and the bonus gems are significantly less. Going to have to uninstall it. For all you gamers on here, sick of the ads? When one pops up, hit the home button then re-open the game from your app list. Takes 2 sec, better than a stupid 20 sec ad.",tag:(ads)

For all you people who or saying too many ads turn of your WiFi. Anyway I can not get to 12x and sometimes I can't move the control ( maybe it is because I am on a phone 📱) IDK but pls fix it ty ... If you fix it and when it says you failed that is just plane RUDE 👿👿👿😠😠😠😡😡😡,tag:(ads)
This app runs my battery down faster that fortnite there's 3 ads every second. It sucks so bad. Dont download.,tag:(ads)

I like it but every time i finish the stage there a ads...lol😠😠😠,tag:(ads)
"Lmao, this game is f***ing awful. I saw the awful ads online, and they literally made me lose braincells just watching them. I then decided to get the game, just to see how bad it was. And boy, it's one of the most garbage games I've ever played. It's way too simple and boring, most of the ""obstacles"" just feel pointless and annoying, and the reward for completing a level just doesn't feel rewarding at all. So please, don't get this game if you seriously want to lose some braincells",tag:(ads)

"Cool concept, terrible execution. Seems to exist mainly to show ads. You dont even watch ads for any benefit, they just try to trick you into pressing buttons to watch ads. Game itself has poor UI",tag:(ads)
"I think the game is nice, but I dont like the idea that you need to watch free ads to level up number of cubes, and diamonds, it does not give an option if you'd like to watch ads for a free level, or you can just pay it with diamonds, also it always say video not available, so when I want to level up, I cant because the only option is watch video ad, and that sucks.",tag:(ads)
Why the mobile ads you make are so bad nobody falls for it,tag:(ads)
"It is a good a game but for me I am not at all getting ads. I am sorry for the people who deleted this game cuz of ads etc. I hope u can make it better and the same people download it again and be happy. Please, this will help all of us. 😊",tag:(ads)
This is an amazing app until you run out of things to buy with the dimonds you earn you can get skins but after you get them the game just gets boring it was fun and challenging to try and get the diamonds for them but after its like oh erm this isn't that fun to be honest. But other than that it's an amazing game. Also there are way to many ads in the app like every time you die there is an ad when I was playing in the middle the game and ad popped. But other than this it's great.,tag:(ads)
Love the game but too much ads,tag:(ads)
This game is nothing but bldy Ads,tag:(ads)

It cannot support handling a lot of cube it a time, so the game freeze for 0.5 second everytime u collect a lot of cube in a short time! It also crashes several time! Please don't play, this is just a game for creator to earn money through ads, do not support this kind of games, the mobile game industry will be ruined by this kind of games.",tag:(ads)

"Ads every 5 seconds, some unpassable levels, and the whole thing is desighned in a way it seems like the game actually just would prefer you to watch an ad to have the privlage of skipping entire levels",tag:(ads)
Fun game but way to many ads. I know you want people to buy the game but I would have enjoyed it more and would have even purchased it if I was able to play more then one level with out having to watch a long ad,tag:(ads)
Don't like the ads though,tag:(ads)
Tiktok ads are just pissing me off.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads not worth it,tag:(ads)
"Okay first this app doesn't have as much ads as all the apps I used and fun,but it's so quick and easy ,and I just started but I guarantee you everyone will have all the skins in 1 day some levels are hard but most are easy,its laggy too so need to give the app a 3/5 because there is problems please make the game longer and a little atleast harder but thank you for making much amazing apps voodoo",tag:(ads)
THE ADS SUCK,tag:(ads)
"Love it, it's fun but you have to watch ads to do anything love it tho plz download I didn't make it just a fan",tag:(ads)
"VOODOO has yet again disappointed me with a game. There's ads every 30 seconds. The levels don't get harder. And 5000 gems just to get a single new person or new block. I don't recommend at all. And to remove ads is expensive. Nope, I'm not paying that much money to get rid of ads. Don't download! Oh and to everyone reading the reviews saying it's impossible to get the 10x wall, it's not. I got there 3 times.",tag:(ads)
It has to many ads but it's still fun. They should add more Cubs.,tag:(ads)
"Literally ridiculous, can barely play theres so many ads, and when you do play it dosent matter if you get every cube you cant pass some levels anyway?! Theres just no point to this game.",tag:(ads)
A complete money grab. It's impossible to play this game without watching ads or shelling out money for difficulty.,tag:(ads)
literally never gives enough blocks to complete the level successfully. Forced to watch stupid ads just to complete a level fully. Then watch another damn ad to play the next level.,tag:(ads)
WHAT KIND OF GAME IS THIS. Bru ads ads ads ads we can't stop with the ads it's a hobby! So annoying I 100% don't recommend this game 99% of it is ads i unstalled after 2 rounds,tag:(ads)
full of ads and gets repetitive over time,tag:(ads)
Yass queen but no ads😢😢😢😢😢😢😢,tag:(ads)

"It has lot of ads :( It has lot ads, glich too. I am dissapointed, My friends say this is a good game :( Sorry for bad grammar",tag:(ads)
"first there are so many ads to many, second the lava is awful, it's just not a good idea and you can't avoid it, id as jumping actually, it would be good, then third it's literally impossible to get over the 10x wall, you can get all the blocks and go over the smallest and it doesn't matter, fourth it's all very expensive to get me characters and blocks, so basically I don't recommend it at all, I uninstalled it after 10+ rounds or so.",tag:(ads)
Good game ad EVERY time you die it can be a 5 second round and they give you a 30 second ad insane amount of ads,tag:(ads)
played for 2 minutes had to watch three 15 seconds ads,tag:(ads)
Keep getting ads everytime u fail a game,tag:(ads)
"Here we go. First-the ads. I'm sure you have been hearing a LOT of reviews about the sheer amount of ads you have. Second, is there any way to win? Like.. No matter what you do, you have like 000.1% chance of winning. What kind of game is this? And third.. The lag is unbelievable. I lagged so hard that it was playing the game for me. Other than that it's a decent time waster. And a waste of time.",tag:(ads)
This app is boring it keeps having ads🙄,tag:(ads)
At first i enjoyed it cause it had very little ads like you could play around 6 rounds before getting an ad but the update changed and now you get an ad after every round. And you can only get the x10 gems after 12ish rounds the other rounds you barely make it over the x1 blocks even if you get all the cubes.✨💞✨,tag:(ads)
"Lags really bad when you swipe from left to right so you end up hitting a wall and losing your cubes. There's A LOT of ads as well. For a child it would probably be entertaining, but I was not impressed. Basic graphics as well.",tag:(ads)
"I have a one plus 7t (that never gives me issues, behind happy with it). This game lags and crashes when collecting blocks or gems. It crashed multiple times, including during the balloon bonus screen. On top of that, there is more ads than gameplay because the game will force a loss by not supplying enough cubes even if you play flawlessly. This game shouldn't even be allowed on the play store, it's an ad farmer.",tag:(ads)
Way to many ads.,tag:(ads)
To mine ads,tag:(ads)
I hate seeing the ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
Entertaining to play but the levels are impossible to beat. You'll spend more time looking at ads than actually playing the game. Uninstalling for this reason.,tag:(ads)
This game totally sucks so f ing bad to many ads the end part SUCKS and that's on period,tag:(ads)
Too much ads! Do not install!,tag:(ads)

Tgis game is so best butu gift you 3 stars for the game because its too many ads...,tag:(ads)
Bad game. Many ads...laggy and it always crashes. Dont get this game!,tag:(ads)
The game was fun until you've earned all the skins and there is too much ads for my liking. If u enjoy games just to play it and dont care about earning anything then this game is for you. Other than that I guess you can try it.,tag:(ads)
"WAY too many ads. And it costs $3.50 to get rid of them, Most other games it only costs a dollar",tag:(ads)
Too many ads!,tag:(ads)
Nice game but needs improvement. I want their to be like challenging things in the game and the game is HARRASSED WITH ADS,tag:(ads)
"The game is overall boring and only entertained me for a couple minutes. It tries to trick you into thinking that you can get over the 10x wall. However, you can't now matter how many cubes you try and save. After the first couple games the whole thing just becomes repetitive and makes you want to uninstall just after downloading it. Other than a good time waster, the game itself isn't very fun and has a lot of ads.",tag:(ads)
"It looks fun but it's literally just ads in between easy to do but impossible to actually win repetitive mini games. Would be more fun if the game didn't just kill you off after perfectly executing something so you watch an ad and then play the same level again just to collect points. Don't download, it's just an ad trap.",tag:(ads)
"Fun game. I liked it but uninstalled after about 15 min. I felt like 50% of that time was watching ads while the game was only fun at 30 sec intervals cut abruptly by repetitive ads. Ad between every level when you win, then ad when you lose, then when you want to unlock prizes. Too much...lost my interest unfortunately. But, fun and smooth game!",tag:(ads)
"Ads, ads, ads! It's a fun game if you can handle all the ads",tag:(ads)
"The ads suck, it's boring and stupid.",tag:(ads)
Its fun in all but i get so may ads! Ad showed this one game I got BUT I got The same ad!!!!!!!,tag:(ads)

Nope too laggy and too much ads,tag:(ads)

It's amazing but it has too much ads,tag:(ads)

Don't play this if u hate ads alot there so MANY ADS LIKE EVERY SECOND LIKE WHY BRUH,tag:(ads)
30 second ads after every level,tag:(ads)
Way too many ads. Between every play! You can't get any sort of rhythm and the ads are longer than the actual levels.,tag:(ads)
Was fun but way to many ads,tag:(ads)
There is literally no way you can win some rounds you can gather ever cube and you would still lose. Plus there is way to many ads like after game theres one.,tag:(ads)
This game sucks and its impossible to get to the end ! Way to many ads the lava things dont help AT ALL dont download this game it gets boring very fast,tag:(ads)
"Was a nice time killer. I was about to get enough gems to get eveyhting in the game over the course of 20 ish mintues so nice time killer. I get why so many ads, but all levels should be able to get over the 10x wall at the end if you make no mistakes at all",tag:(ads)
I played a bit and got to the end. I had gathered 5000 gems and it STILL didnt give it to me also it forced me to watch an add then it only gave me like 100 gems very boring gameplay and shoves ads down your throat I do not reccomend at all,tag:(ads)
Bought it and I still get ads I want a refund!,tag:(ads)
"Do a five second task, watch 30 seconds of ads; repeat. Could be a fun game if you weren't bombarded by ads",tag:(ads)
It was fun I only have one thing to give a heads-up sometimes when you press Retry it pulls up a ad any way,tag:(ads)
"if you turn off ur wifi and data, so you get no ads, it is an amazing game and is really fun. Levels are not so easy or so hard so they are impossible to keep you busy. cute graphics, good for kids, good for passing time!",tag:(ads)
"Its a horrible game, it lags insanly and it is just ads you cant even win and the fist level just throws you right into hardmode",tag:(ads)

"Ads, ads and ads. Nothing else",tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)
This is a very fun game but it give an option do you wanna skip the level while watching an ad and I press no but it still makes me watch like 30 second ads,tag:(ads)
"Cool concept, but waaaay too much with the ads. Like, every level is something like 15-20 seconds long, but there's a 30 second video ad after every single one. It isnt even spaced out. Kind of insulting to be that greedy with the ads",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads unplayable,tag:(ads)
This game spam ads like crazy and has no efffort put into it,tag:(ads)
"I complete everything in the game. It is repetitive, dull, and has adds after almost every turn. The ads are also misleading and misadvertizing. I'm suprized there isnt a law against this yet.",tag:(ads)
First of all there are tooooo many ads second when you surf you can never win i try try and try infinty times i stil never rech the ending that makes me sooooo mad😡😡try to think about the levels do you ander stand.but i do like the game.,tag:(ads)
The ads every level or two are ridiculous. You'll spend half your playtime in this game watching them. Not kidding.,tag:(ads)
Fun but way too many ads,tag:(ads)
Plagued with ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
Boring. Turn on flight mode to not get ads. Maxed out upgrades by level 20.,tag:(ads)
There are so many ads and the game so boring honestly if i vould i would give it worse than a 1 ster rating after every level there would be and ad and each level is only 20 second long i have seen so many ads on apps like youtube and tiktok the ads on the games also claim to be playable when they are not Thank you for yout time,tag:(ads)
Would be fun of I didn't watch more ads than time spent playing the game.,tag:(ads)

"Decent idea of a game, too many ads. I also dont like the banner which appears when you don't share your data with them. Dont recomend",tag:(ads)
Absolutely boring no concept Too much ads Waste of time,tag:(ads)
"Best I can give it. I can put up with ads, if they have incintive, but this game has ads that you are forced to watch between levels, however the ads that give you free levels dont give you what's promised. Good design, but ads kill this game.",tag:(ads)
I was originally going to give this game 3 stars. There's are tons of ads and sometimes it completely glitches and give me loads of different screens all at once. That only happens every once in a while so it's not that bad. I dont usually write reviews for games but when I got an ad literally in the middle of a level I had to write one. There's a time and place for ads and the middle of the level really isn't it.,tag:(ads)
Trash too much ads boring this is not original idea,tag:(ads)
So many ads and it was always freezing but it's a good game,tag:(ads)
I hate this game so much. Its so infuriating. U can never get passed 10X and get the gems its annoying. There.is wayyy to many ads and there is a balloon u can pop but u need a ad to open it i clicked the balloon and it wouldnt give me the ad to watch. Would not recommend if u get mad easily. Im definitely deleting this app rn 🙄,tag:(ads)
This game is picky! On my mom's phone I did not get a lot of ads bc her phone had a lot of energy and had good memory. On my phone I got a ton of ads every level! Also it is IMPOSSIBLE to get past ×10! This game belongs in the dumpster!,tag:(ads)
Dont get the game it completely sucks the lava takes away your blocks faster then it should the game can be a little glitchy too many ads matter of fact ad after time you pass,tag:(ads)
"20 seconds of gameplay per 10 seconds of ads with moving ""X"" buttons to close the ads.",tag:(ads)
Good game but too many ads,tag:(ads)
Games pretty fun a great way to pass time ads are rarely duplicates my only problem is in the balloon prize room for some reason if you pick the the rainbow balloon which you have to watch an ad the pop for some reason when I finally do pop it the app just locks me into the prize room,tag:(ads)
"If you want to play, turn your mobile data and WiFi off so that you don't get the ads. The game is practically unplayable online",tag:(ads)
It was fun until I started getting ads every level (which was only around two minutes) don't download unless you enjoy dragging your eyeballs across sandpaper,tag:(ads)
Way too many Ads!,tag:(ads)
immediately started lagging and giving ads.,tag:(ads)
"Too many ads, if you play this game, most of your time will be spent watching ads.",tag:(ads)
It's fun some glitchy but over all it is a good game and a lot of ads but its good,tag:(ads)
Do not downlaod this game unless you want to spend all you time watching ads. Or pay $4 for no ads. Ridiclous,tag:(ads)
Ads,tag:(ads)
The most boring game ever and the shittiest ads,tag:(ads)
Fine except for the ads,tag:(ads)
Ads ever other level. Even if you get every block and lose the minimum amount u still can't get too x10 don't waste time or storage on this,tag:(ads)
Its fun enough ig but to get anything but the basic skin you have to play a ton and the ads make that rlly not worth the trouble,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
This game has no right to be as laggy as it is for how simple it is nor should it bludgeon you with half as many ads as it does. Hall of Shame game.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads an just a lame ass game..,tag:(ads)
"Very disappointing, first problem I have is too many ads like every other level that has to stop, second problem I have is when your dodging the big stacks and you move away it just moves you in front of it and you end up losing your cubes and the red lava thingy has to go like it doesn't even give you a way to get out of that, sickening and lastly you never get a chance to get past 10x what is that, that isnt fair also the little green boost should go away because they don't help at all.......",tag:(ads)
The idea of the game is good but the ads are to annoying,tag:(ads)
Far too many 30 second ads that can't be skipped & only fun for about 5 minutes,tag:(ads)
"Gets super boring, it's not challenging, and has so many ads do not recommend unless you're like 4",tag:(ads)
To many ads you cant win,tag:(ads)
As usually too much ads remove theres too much every level I have to watch 1 ad every single time one time I had to watch a 30 second or 15 second ad so please remove it,tag:(ads)
"The game is constantly shoving ads in my face. Its annoying. This company does not care for their players, they make games for ad revenue. These people are the cancer of mobile gaming.",tag:(ads)
"OK game. Smooth graphics and sensitive to touch but in under an hour of play I'd maxed all my levels, unlocked all the unlockables and still have loads of gems to spare and only at level 67. Levels are short and a lot of blocks take a block more than they should, also most levels are impossible to get to the last finish as there aren't enough blocks or it's impossible to get enough enough. It's alright to waste an hour of your time on but then you've unlocked everything.",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
"This game is pretty simple, but if you collect every single cube possible in a level and lose as few as possible you still cannot reach the x10 at the end of each level, which is frankly bad design and given that you consistently get to the x1 just before it is likely on purpose to try and keep you playing with an impossible goal so you watch the ads between every very short level.",tag:(ads)
"TOO MUCH ADS🙃. Everytime i click ""next"" or ballooonn.. the ads will showed 😒😒",tag:(ads)
"Like most Voodoo games, their concept is fun.. for about 5 to 10 minutes. And you get about half gameplay and half ads.",tag:(ads)
Like Voodoo's normal games a boring not fun cash grab game meant for small children to rage and scream while you and your greedy hand pile up money with you ads. 0 star game if I could.,tag:(ads)
"Very generic game, extremely glitchy. Forced ads almost every other round.",tag:(ads)
"This game is fun to play. Something to pass the time, but there are a few things that could make the game more enjoyable. First thing is the gems. There aren't many things to buy with the gems and within the first day I was able to buy everything and get all the cube skins. Second the game doesn't have much challenge and can get boring quick if you don't have something to actually work for (such as getting gems for more skins or raising your level). Lastly to many ads,maybe after every 3 levels",tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)
Every 2 games you got a ad in I hate ads I just wanna play it with no ads,tag:(ads)
😠 I hate these apps so much! They are just boring and are just a trap to make you watch ads DO NOT DOWNLOAD 😡,tag:(ads)
There are too many ads,tag:(ads)
Ads and gets difficult,tag:(ads)
WAY to many Ads. Ohhh you played for 3 seconds? Here's a minute worth of ads before being able to play another 3 second run....before another minute of ads,tag:(ads)
All the game is adds and they are just trying to take your money since you have to pay for no ads so dumb don't buy this app it is just an ad channel.,tag:(ads)
SOOOOOOO good but I could deal with less ads,tag:(ads)
I think it's really nice but I read that there's a bunch of ads it says but I very much like it much,tag:(ads)
Love the concept of the game. But it keept crashing. Just take off all of the ads!,tag:(ads)
The app is mindless fun but the ads break the app if you ignore too many. And there's too many ads anyway,tag:(ads)
Its a very chill game. Ads are not to much of a bother. The game did perform awkwardly after some level completion. The level passed started playing on the menu screen. I completed that and got to collect a crazy amount of purple diamonds. I currently have 1mill.,tag:(ads)
Ads make this unplayable.,tag:(ads)
Ads,tag:(ads)
ADS ARE ANNOYING AND FIX THE POINT OF VIEW,tag:(ads)

"Man it is a pretty chill concept, but it is LITERALLY unplayable thanks to the ads. You ""win"" well good job now watch an ad. Oh nice here open this ""balloon,"" dont want to? Well you dont got a choice, ALSO have this ad when you click to open the balloon. Oh you finished watching an ad and clicked the X button? Well it doesnt matter have this pop up ad that forces you to click it.",tag:(ads)
Decent idea. Poor execution. Ads all day everyday. Typical voodoo style.,tag:(ads)
"Shouldn't have to watch an ad after every death, no other game that I've played operates this way. Ads should ONLY be a free way to get rewards. This is just pure greediness and it's pathetic. Uninstall.",tag:(ads)
"It's ok, ads are ridiculously annoying. And it seems like the levels are built to where some parts are unbeatable. And that's not fair or right.",tag:(ads)
It is a very fun and addicting game but the ads can be a bit much.,tag:(ads)
Its literally horrible there is no purpose and when you get to the end there is always lava or something that gets your cubes down and you can get to the end..i done recommend downloading this.....oh and ads gallor like you play the game then 2 adds play.....the it lags really bad....hope this helps,tag:(ads)
Just the best game ever. The ads are problems but its still fun.,tag:(ads)
Nice game 👌 but finished the game in two days . No ads if u play it after turning off mobile data .make it more interesting.,tag:(ads)
No real chance of getting to the 10x bonus. Loads of lag. Third person view at an angle is really off-putting. I spent more time looking at ads than actually playing the game.,tag:(ads)

15 seconds of play. 1 min of ads.,tag:(ads)
Literally got ad after ad after ad whether I won or lost after every level there was an advertisement. So many ads that the game glitched and kept playing on it's own while asking me to retry or skip the game. It's ridiculous. I don't understand why y'all be so desperate to make money from the ads that y'all send so many through that it glitches the game. Chill out.,tag:(ads)
"Not fun ads every time you complete something wether it be the level or the ""balloon"" thing even tho you skip the ad that doubles your currency it will still show you one, on top of that most of the time it doesn't even give you the chance to get the highest score multiplier/ /------> don't download it just don't stuff like this shouldn't exist, there only in it for the ad revenue",tag:(ads)

The game is very laggy freezes every other second and not only that loads ads every time u do anything. Can't even play the game without an ad. Mainly all loses are because of lag and freezes or an ad starts to load.,tag:(ads)

Way to many ads,tag:(ads)
"So may ads, worst experience",tag:(ads)
"Poorly designed, with seemingly pointless and unchallenging gameplay. The setup of the cubes and obstacles are such that, more often than not, it is impossible to reach the end of the track, regardless of how well you steer. In addition, with wifi on, the game delivers a minimum of 5 seconds of advertising between every round. Many of the ads show inaccurate gameplay for other games, and some are borderline pornographic. The game was probably made for the sole purpose of advertising. 0 stars.",tag:(ads)

Great game but too much ads ... they really irritating ... every level you play you get a whole bunch of ads ... could tolerate it anymore .. would advise anyone to download it unless they don't mind the ads,tag:(ads)
"Forced ads after every round, 20 sec of playing followed by 5-15 of ads lmao YOU SHOULD NEVER FORCE ADS ON PEOPLE either make it an option at the end to get a point/money boost or maybe a continue when you fail Or make your game a pay game... be upfront dont force dumbass ads on people...",tag:(ads)
ads,tag:(ads)
I really like the game but the ads pop up literally every other retry I can't keep playing. Ive only had it for less than three minutes and got four ads.,tag:(ads)
Subpar and glitchy gameplay and video ads with chintzy skip buttons after every game. Just not worth it.,tag:(ads)
"This game has no purpose whatsoever, it was created to generate ads. Fun for the first few levels, but it doesn't get anymore challenging. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the amount of cubes on a level. Max out your starting cubes to 5 and then collect every cube on the level, hit all of the red cubes at their bare minimum,and you won't make it all the way to the end of the level. Also sometimes you don't get the jewel multiplier. 0/5 if possible. Terrible game.",tag:(ads)
"Funny game, but there is no way I'm going to play it anymore. There are ads after every game....",tag:(ads)
Played 2 rounds hit 2 ads im out. Youd probably make more money if you cut the adds in half.,tag:(ads)
Ads are annoying and I beat the game in half a day.,tag:(ads)
Unrelated annoying ads. Each game lasts only 20 second. All levels are similar. No challenge at all.,tag:(ads)
"Ads, so many god damn ads.",tag:(ads)
"The game is a good idea. I hated the execution though. It has so many obstacles that you have to get every single cube, but I'm not sure that you'd pass if you did. I hate the ads. I hate the fact that it vibrates my device every time I add blocks, or lost them. There is no incentive to this game. No real prize. The graphics are decent, exactly what you expect from the makers. But, the game just wasn't good imo. Just. Meh.",tag:(ads)
"The difficulty in this game comes from the fact that the player's POV is more to the side, rather than directly behind the cube, so that it is difficult to see where you are on the map (left to right, etc) - especially with big fingers. It's allright if you have time to kill, in airplane mode ofc. But to me most of Voodoo's games are designed solely to serve you ads, while you play cookie cutter games which could be a lot of fun if properly developed further (cuz the concept is there)",tag:(ads)
TRASH! It is just a another massive advert app. You'll spend more time watching ads and having your data collected than actually being entertained. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF TRASH APP.,tag:(ads)
Why do these free games with ads every 2 seconds over heat my phone do bad?,tag:(ads)

I love this game because there is not many adds and it is so much fun!i reccomend this game to people who dont like ads!,tag:(ads)
"Took less than an hour to beat. Turn on airplane mode before opening the app to bypass ads. Would be rated higher if it had a longer playtime. Sometimes the game glitches and takes away one or two more blocks than it should have, which is very aggravating since it messes with the multiplier at the end.",tag:(ads)
"The game itself was ok, but the amount of ads was unpleasant. I get that it's a free game and that's how they make their money, but I'd rather pay a couple bucks to just play the game.",tag:(ads)
"Decent game, unplayable because of ads.",tag:(ads)
Too much ads and not enough levels.,tag:(ads)
The game is littered with ads. More ads than gameplay,tag:(ads)
This game is fun but the ads after every round is getting annoying.,tag:(ads)
"Ads ads ads and more ads. One of, if not the worst games that smashes you with usless, braindead ada over and over again, will recommend against and if i ever see that someone has this game i will unistall it without them knowing. Complete garbage",tag:(ads)
Too many ads and retry button delayed so you generate more ad revenue. Bye then.,tag:(ads)
Looks like a fun game...but there isnt actually a goal other then to die so u can watch more ads. Even after making 0 mistakes and collecting every cube in a level u cant even get past the last wall of the level.,tag:(ads)
Garbage. Get ready for non skip-able ads every 30 seconds.,tag:(ads)
It have a lot of ads,tag:(ads)
Cute game and fun. Way to many ads.,tag:(ads)
To many ads to much pay to play. Some of the blocks are hard to tell where you are at and you run into stacks that are to big for you.,tag:(ads)
"It just isn't great in my opinion. I move left, it goes the opposite way, even if I have enough cubes I still die? As well the ads got very annoying after awhile. Especially having a two minute long one.",tag:(ads)
Game stops you and says you failed when you have more than enough blocks to get through. Too many ads. Boring.,tag:(ads)
To many forced ads it's like one every two stages. But other than that the concept of the game is pretty fun,tag:(ads)
Just a game to make you watch ads. You are unable to do anything or make it far without having to watch an ad before. The game with stall its self and make you watch an ad to continue.,tag:(ads)
More ads than game.,tag:(ads)
DONT DOWNLOAD WAY TO MANY ADS PLAYED FOR 5 MINUTES SEEN 6 ADS DELETING NOW HORRIBLE,tag:(ads)
Nothing but ads. Cancer for your phone,tag:(ads)
So many ads,tag:(ads)
"Not skill based at all. You can collect every cube in a run and still not pass the level, far too easy to unlock everything, ads pop up after every single run. Fun game to pass the time but very bland after the first few levels. However, I'm still playing and I'm at level 126 so I can't say it's not fun and hooks me in.",tag:(ads)
More adverts than game play. Game appears to funnel you towards failure so it can get more ad revenue. Couldn't be sure as there were so many ads I had very little gameplay,tag:(ads)
Jesus christ. Ads much? Horrible.,tag:(ads)
The amount of ads is unreal. This is ridiculous I can't even play the game 😡,tag:(ads)
Good game how ever the ads are so loud and you cant mute them,tag:(ads)
"Same old ad generator with a mini game between ads, doesn't even work well, the idea behind the mechanics and the actual gameplay don't mesh, the game will hang not allowing quick movements required to pass a level.

"There are so many ads, it's not even funny.",tag:(ads)
"You can beat the game in a single day if you want to. There are only 9 types of cubes to unlock, and 5 levels of advantageous upgrades (higher starting tower and offline gem collection). If you collect a bunch of gems (via getting to the 10x multiplier area) and have to pop balloons, you forfeit all of your gems for the lesser amount in the balloons. Other than these flaws its easy to kill time with this app. There are probably a bunch of ads but I don't have that problem.",tag:(ads)
"fun game, not big on the microtransactions and session throttling, but aside from that it's a mini-fire emblem game (which is good)",tag:(p2w)
"This game is very overwhelming at first. There are so many things going on at once, and if you're new, the you may be instantly turned off by it. There's so much that isn't even explained in the game itself, and in order to complete the harder challenges, outside research is required. The microtransactions are fair, you can buy the item needed to summon new heroes, or specific heroes, but one star removed for the FEH pass. It's 10$ a month and feels essentially to the experience.",tag:(p2w)
"it's what it says, A mobile fe game, which is good and bad. bad being orbs and microtransactions. That and also FEH pass as a whole has made me all but drop the game..",tag:(p2w)
"Your typical Gacha game. Not as egregious with the microtransactions as other notorious Nintendo mobile titles, but it's getting worse, most notably with Feh pass creating a pay wall for good quality of life features. If you're going to start a collection or competitive strategy game, I'd recommend a trading card game. You'll get better buyback value for rare cards than you will sinking orbs for the chance at a rare hero in Feh.",tag:(p2w)
"Lowered my rating due to the subscription service. I loved this game and regularly spent to support the game because of the non-intrusive microtransactions and how much I enjoyed it. As others have mentioned, however, a subscription service was implemented and intrusively so. Due to the implementation of said subscription service I cannot support this game.",tag:(p2w)
"Runs well, plays well, looks great. Also, despite there being microtransactions, Nintendo makes it 100% optional to buy, due to getting orbs daily and after clearing the missions on each difficulty; by doing so, one who plays or buys will still have the same chance and oppurtunity to get their favorite heroes from the franchise. This review still holds as of 2020, on top of adding additional ways to play and compete; all that's missing is a live 1-2 min. per turn competitive matchmaking.",tag:(p2w)
I like everything Fire Emblem and this game has a decent meta as well only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is well the microtransactions Never liked that trend for any game,tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions, beware",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions sneaker don't have to buy, but exist very tempting, be careful.",tag:(p2w)
"Plenty of issues for a Gacha game, but not enough to make me completely install until now. Paid subscription on top of all the other microtransactions is just gross, and locking Quality of Life features behind it even worse. At least they made the decison to quit nice and easy.",tag:(p2w)
"Get rid of Hall of Forms. The balance of it is too far off and the units you're given just makes it unfair. Once you reach the infernal levels it's a struggle to beat even teams of 3. Don't appreciate the season pass, too many microtransactions now. Been playing since it started but thinking I may have to stop it's getting too frustrating now",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions are being greedily ramped up with the addition of a premium pass at a ludicrous price point (not that any price is acceptable), and an increasing number of features locked behind payment. Another case of abhorrent monetisation based around what is essentially a gambling system.",tag:(p2w)
"I still love the art, the gameplay, and many types of characters to make the strategy more challenging. BUT I have brought my rating down to 1 star from a 5 star because the game is literally pay to win now with the introduction of FeH Pass. Like you srsly werent making enough with all the orb microtransactions? This has gone from something I loved playing to something that is frustrating to even look at. Thanks for ruining the game. You have shown that you truly don't care about the players.",tag:(p2w)
"It's one oh the best mobile games available if you are looking for strategy gameplay. Microtransactions aren't much of a problem, you can get a lot out of it without spending. Edit: pay to win and quality of life features locked.",tag:(p2w)
"2020: P2W has worsened.Heavy emphasis on microtransactions. The random stats make things worse especially when you upgrade the units star grade to find their stats were rerolled and are now terrible even when fully levelled. There are occasional freebies but the drop rates are noticeably stingier to push premium. Power creep has gotten worse, older units are now redundant. Not recommended for f2p players unless you have the patience of a saint or very deep coffers to keep paying for progress.",tag:(p2w)
"the feh pass killed my good fath in this game, you took what was arguably your best game in both microtransactions and gameplay and ruined it with a 10$ a moth month subscription for QOL improvements and 2 character. and then had the gal to make it so you cant clear you quest notice of quest you cant complete without it.",tag:(p2w)
"Going down a bad road: I play the game daily since I love fire emblem and rather enjoy using it to pass time, but starting today, there is a new subscription feature. For $10 a month, on a game that already has microtransactions, you get features that can very easily tilt the game in your favor: a pay to win subscription. Usually, I can ignore the paying features, but the quests added are put with the others. When completed, you will be told you can only collect them by buying the subscription.",tag:(p2w)
"Updating to change my current view on this awful game. incredibly predatory in terms of microtransactions, lessening the amount of free currency for summoning per month to half. Game lacks any mode to even use the characters summoned in other than arena and aether raids, both modes aimed at paying crowds. Look for a better gacha game that actually has gameplay. also, don't fall for other reviews that tell you that they get lots of 5⭐s as 5⭐s mean next to nothing in this game.",tag:(p2w)
A game that was once amazing is now plauged with boring modes and predatory microtransactions that are almost required to enjoy anything at a higher level and a subscription service that provides features that should be free,tag:(p2w)
"Was fun to occasionally play, with new feh pass it's becoming an even bigger gap between players who pay and those who don't. It isn't fun to play a game you have almost no chance of winning at because someone else threw 120$ a year at it(that's 2 brand new full big name games which don't require more microtransactions to be effective at the game).",tag:(p2w)
"113.88 USD per year for the subscription pass lmao, you can almost buy Fire Emblem Three Houses TWICE for that money. I think Nintendo heard the praise this game got about not having BS microtransactions and went like ""nooope we're not making a good mobile game"".",tag:(p2w)
My first experience with Fire Emblem. I find certain battle elements difficult to fully understand but I'm not dying often so I can't be doing too badly. In my opinion the microtransactions in this game are not necessary to play as it is possible to earn orbs and such while playing.,tag:(p2w)
All dem microtransactions...,tag:(p2w)
"Okay at best, much rather play a real fire emblem game. Microtransactions are too present and egregious and just ruin the game for me.",tag:(p2w)
This is easily one of the best force collection type games on phone that I've played. Its is fun and easy to build your forces and even though there are microtransactions the game dosen't fell as if you ever have to buy any to advance.,tag:(p2w)
One of the games where it's actually free and doesn't amount to 69.99 Of microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
Excellent FE game with far too many things to do and side objectives to complete. Despite microtransactions the game is still thoroughly enjoyable even if you don't want to spend money on it.,tag:(p2w)
"It's a decent game, even with the microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
This app fits perfectly as a game you can play casually and more intensely as you see fit. Most will switch between the two. Also works well if you want to close the game mid combat and continue later. If you have problems with spending to much on microtransactions stay away.,tag:(p2w)
"Fantastic little strategy game with intuitive mobile controls that are easy to get used to and familiar characters from the Fire Emblem series. It does have microtransactions as a gacha-style game, however, does offer a good number of orbs without any form of payment by completing the story and dedicating time to it and completing the challenges. Fun to play and allows itself to be played in short bursts without consequences for leaving in the middle of something. It can be played commuting.",tag:(p2w)
"very fun, a lot of good content for killing time or sitting down to play. it's got microtransactions for stuff like extra stamina or more orbs for summoning heroes, but with even semi-regular play it's very easy to obtain these items for free. no ads, very actively updated, tons of events. the fire emblem gameplay aspects are definitely watered down, but honestly it's a phone game for killing time so that helps out for brevity's sake. this is what mobile games should strive to be. 5/5 worth a dl",tag:(p2w)
Many Microtransactions but overall i great nintendo game.,tag:(p2w)
"Best gacha on the market. F2p is generous with all currencies and summoning rates are fair with frequent new heroes. If you're into microtransactions, there are monthly specials that often have two currencies for one purchase.",tag:(p2w)
"tight gameplay loop, microtransactions are purely optional. very well made. add rinka please.",tag:(p2w)
"Fire Emblem Heroes is an okay game at best. It's very fun at times, but the 5-star pull rate is so low that it's just infuriating when you don't get the one you want. The gameplay is repetitive, and microtransactions are practically required to get the units you want. Overall a disappointment.",tag:(p2w)
"I'd say that the microtransactions have lost focus over time, the devs have really started catering more to free players in nice ways.",tag:(p2w)
"The power creep is insane and its now impossible to enjoy the game without sinking money into microtransactions unless you have the patience of a saint. So many times i pull for a png of my favorite characters and i always get one of the same 3 characters, depending on the color i chose, and i think ""why am i even fueling this garbage fire""",tag:(p2w)
pretty good! includes microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"This is a great mobile game, yes. BUT (and a reaaallly BIG one) Recently, it's been a lot harder to get orbs and it seems like they only want us to get less which means less units and more money in their pockets from microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
best game for FE fans. easy to learn and virtually no microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"Lots of fun and lots to do. Play casually like I do or get really deep into all those crunchy stats. I've been playing since launch and haven't spent a dime either, so you can have fun without it getting out of hand with microtransactions. A MUST for FE fans.",tag:(p2w)
"A lot of fun if you're into complex strategy. doable without microtransactions, but itll take longer to get a good army going, and you'll have a harder time in the high tiers of player vs player.",tag:(p2w)
"Post 2nd anniversary update to my original review- still a great game. Im removing a star because i would spend money on the game, but the prices make the microtransactions not really worth it, and, despite the plethora of game modes, there's still no true PVP options. That said, it's been a very lovely game to pick up and play. The characters are likeable, the story is decent, and the art and voice acting are wonderfully done. Very nice little time-killer :3",tag:(p2w)
"turn based strategy, i just wish it didnt shill for microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"The chibi art style can take a little getting used to, as can having the character designs so different. These and some iffy movement options, however, are my only gripe - fantastic pacing, good microtransactions, feels like an FE spinoff. Love it!",tag:(p2w)
"A good, fun game unfortunately worsened by microtransactions. The gacha mechanic is integral to the game and makes it difficult to have the optimal experience without spending possibly hundreds of dollars.",tag:(p2w)
"EDIT: Moved review to 3 stars. Intelligent Systems has been removing orb (the premium currency) opportunities from free to play, most likely to squeeze the playerbase for money. If the trend continues or is fixed, I will update the review further. ORIGINAL: It's a solid Fire Emblem lite, and a good intro to the franchise. There is a surprising amount of depth and as long as you like gacha style games, the microtransactions are understandable.",tag:(p2w)
"All the fun of fire emblem, but without the fun.  Plus microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)

"100% Microtransactions. If you like Fire Emblem on the DS and Gamecube, this game is not similar at all. Get ready to pay through the nose unless you don't care to advance at all.",tag:(p2w)
"Great game, fun to pick up every now and then. Requires microtransactions to play properly though.",tag:(p2w)
"Great characters of the series, basic yet complex strategy and abilities. I wish there was a way that you can purchase the charcater you want with the orbs instead of summoning orbs of a certain color and not know what you can get. I hate these random loot microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)

Microtransactions are eh but eh Hector Emblem,tag:(p2w)
"The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that some of the progression isn't very well explained. It has the standard microtransactions you'd expect from a free to play mobile, but it's my new go-to time killer for mobile. I do wish that a character's star rating would increase automatically if you grinded him/her to level 40. Otherwise there's not really a point to levelling anyone who isn't already 5 stars.",tag:(p2w)
A little like the old GBA Fire Emblem games. Never happy about microtransactions and the feathers are kinda dumb but it's fun and still retains the tactical side,tag:(p2w)
"It's pretty good. Setting aside that this game throws half of the lore and traditional mechanics away, it plays well. It feels pay to win with the hero summoning, and the microtransactions are highly controversial, especially with recent laws in place to go against gambling in games. I usually wouldn't care for such a business practice in a game, but free or not , mobile or console, this game is targeted to a young audience. The rating this game not acceptable, especially going off the ESR guidelines and overall morale. I'd like to see the microtransactions be less of a roadblock to keep players from having a fun experience sometime in the future.",tag:(p2w)
"The standard for how gatcha games should be implemented, Fire Emblem Heroes is a great game and a must-play for Fire Emblem fans. Normally Im not a fan of F2P mobile games, but FEH does it right, the game is ludicrously generous with its ""premium"" currency, and the microtransactions feel less like a neccecity and more like a supplement. Im also frankly shocked at how well the SRPG gameplay is executed so well in this format. When I first heared the map sizes were only 8x6 grids, I had my doubts, but I was proven wrong as there is still plenty of map variety here. Units are also infinitely customizable, as you can transfer skills from one unit to another (at the cost of the unit giving the skill), so you can make some crazy builds. The game also pays homage to its source material, with units from every fire emblem game appearing, and with the above mentioned customization, theres a good chance your favorite units (should you actually get the units you want) can be honed into a viable team. The main downside is the fact that the units you get are determined purely by chance. The game runs events that make it more likely to draw certain units, but at the end of the day there is no guarantee you will get the unit you want. The game's story mode is also significantly weaker compared to most FE games, but my expectations werent high for a story rich free to play mobile game. At the end of the day, FEH is a great free game, and SRPG fans, and especially Fire emblem fans, old or new, should give it a shot.",tag:(p2w)
Easy to play Without microtransactions. Enjoyable and fun gatcha game.,tag:(p2w)
"Grear, game, great characters but way too many microtransactions. Take that into consideration please, but over all, great game!",tag:(p2w)

without relying on microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
Lessen the microtransactions and this is a great app,tag:(p2w)
"As a long-term fire emblem fan, I love this game. It keeps to the core of 
the franchise and applies the mechanics to a mobile setting very well. I 
was feeling like it was a little easy at first, maybe even oversimplified 
in ways, but that didn't last. It doesn't feel so difficult though that I 
feel like I have to buy anything. If I did choose to buy anything, it 
wouldn't help with the gameplay anyways. The game fundamentally doesn't 
force you into a corner of microtransactions. Its refreshing and fun. Plus, 
regular updates and events keep that momentum flowing.",tag:(p2w)
"A great mobile edition to the epic franchise, Heroes does justice to your 
favourite characters from your favourite games, all while keeping 
microtransactions completely optional.",tag:(p2w)
"Fire Emblem is a great series and when I heard that the series was having a 
mobile version I just knew I had to play it. Compared to the other 
versions, Heroes is pretty much the same concept, except less units to 
control and a very different combat system for skills and how units evolve. 
Of course there are microtransactions to get better units but most of the 
time you can get the orbs to pull units fairly easily. Overall a great game 
to try and of course perfect nods to the other games in the series.",tag:(p2w)
"Fun game, despite being a gacha it handles microtransactions pretty well 
and isn't too scummy. One of the best games out there for mobile.",tag:(p2w)
"It's a very fun game to play both online and off and it doesn't require 
microtransactions to be enjoyable.",tag:(p2w)
"Easily the best mobile game on the market. None of the microtransactions 
get in the way of gameplay and very minimal ads. The gameplay is close 
enough to console Fire Emblem games for veterans, and simple enough for 
anyone to pick up and play. Any of your defeated heroes return after each 
battle, unlike standard FE games, which works out fine considering how the 
hero summoning works.",tag:(p2w)
A great strategy game that gives you a lot to do and does not break the bank with microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
It's a bite sized fire emblem experience. Well polished and I don't feel pressured to spend additional money via microtransactions to enjoy the game.,tag:(p2w)
"Great mini FE game. New and old players both will like new probably for the simplified gameplay, older FE players for the art and homage to all characters. Probably one of the smoothest running Android apps I've seen. Can do microtransactions but they are not at all necessary unless you want to avoid grinding (even so there is no avoiding the grind lol). I did the main story all in one day (currently goes to 9-5) but got very lucky with the RNG on the summoning. Now I'm going to spam arena till more content is added :P",tag:(p2w)
"While the harder missions rely you being exceptionally stronger than your foe along with them hesitating to move before you are in range reduces the stradegy in game where there is already a pitiful amount. However the adorable sprites, bite-size gameplay and bits of a full on Fire Emblem game here make this mobile title worth the time invested. Also it's microtransactions aren't in your face nor is game designed against you to encourage them.",tag:(p2w)
The game does not keep a record of your google play microtransactions. If you don't link a nintendo account you will lose your investment if you lose or format your device.,tag:(p2w)

microtransactions suck,tag:(p2w)
"Solid game largely in keeping with classic Fire Emblem. Story is weak, but gameplay is great. Controls and gameplay could be improved to avoid annoying situations in combat that shouldn't happen, like when a unit gets moved by accident or having special attacks without the option to use them only when you want to. Game involves grinding, like any rpg, but the grind is fun for those who like Fire Emblem gameplay. Microtransactions are as annoying as in any game, but so far I am able to progress effectively without feeling like purchases are necessary to advance at a decent pace. Fun game, and one of the best free to plays I've enjoyed.",tag:(p2w)
"It's a great mobile game that does hit you everytime you run out of orbs ""Hey buy this to be able to get everything you want"". I'm very glad this game doesn't hit you with microtransactions like every other free mobile game",tag:(p2w)
"Fun and well made, the cost of microtransactions is very high, like kind of ridiculous but they have made something very slick. Not getting a 5 star character for long periods makes lose my desire to play to be honest, as currently I spend most of my time leveling 5 star characters and making new teams (Would like an increase in amount of teams)",tag:(p2w)
Forced to buy microtransactions for rare heroes; otherwise GREAT!,tag:(p2w)
"Fun game, it is Fire Emblem Light, but good to compare rolls with friends, and it doesn't extort or force cash shops (orbs are the only thing available through microtransactions) Any other crafting mats are in game rewards.",tag:(p2w)
"This game uses up your microtransactions and cancels them. I was out of ""Stamina"" (fre play credits) and selected back. I stead of exiting, the game used a consumable and refilled my stamina, against my controls. NINTENDO IS ENCOURAGING GAMBLING.",tag:(p2w)
"This game is terrible, not for its inherent quality, but the seedy underbelly beneath. The game preys on microtransactions to earn its coin, and much like a lottery machine, it can royally mess you up if you're careless. I was witness to this happen to someone else, and it's    beyond words to describe. Shame on you, Nintendo. I thought you were better than that.",tag:(p2w)
"I know what you might be thinking. I've given 5 stars to the major categories but I've listed this as hating it. I've been a fan of Fire Emblem for some time now and I was thrilled when IS brought out an app version I could play on the go.  However, through the many months of playing, I've encountered more than a few issues that I've had to resolve with customer service. Service is putting it generously. They are wholly unhelpful and regurgitate the same instructions over and over again in hopes that suddenly the issued will be magically resolved. I've had an issue for weeks regarding purchasing their orbs in which they blamed Google for the errors I was receiving. After a few more weeks, this was finally escalated and I was able to purchase once more. After that purchase, he same issue began once again.   I'm pretty peeved about this. FEH was a welcomed break in my day and as I don't game regularly as I did when I was younger I was happy and financially able to support the game through microtransactions. Seems as though I will have to selve FEH for good due to the inconsistencies of IS' mobile customer support.",tag:(p2w)

Great artwork and a fun game. Hate the microtransactions you have to do to try and get certain characters. Just let me buy the ones I want instead of random duplicates.,tag:(p2w)
"This is a great mobile game. Something fun to whip out in a spare moment of boredom. Not nearly as deep as regular Fire Emblem games of course, but still solid in its own right. Nintendo is generous with the free orbs, and with letting you earn your own at a steady pace that doesn't frustrate. That means the microtransactions aren't rammed down your throat, and so you actually feel like buying orbs is a nice bonus instead of prying content from their tight-fisted grip.",tag:(p2w)
"It's not filled with microtransactions, which is a breath of fresh air.",tag:(p2w)
"The game is really solid... For a mobile game. It's a perfect FE game for the phone that captures the gameplay of the original well. There's a lot of flaws like there being only four characters you can control in one battle. The combat mechanics are no where near as deep as the originals, you only get ONE skill, small maps etc. In terms of getting characters, there's microtransactions and RNG. BUT, exceptionally I did not mind this much, as you get enough orbs by just playing. This is also a free game so it's understandable for Nintendo to add microtransactions. Overall, my favourite mobile game I've played.",tag:(p2w)
"I'm wary of any game with microtransactions, but gave this game a shot since I'm a fan of the series. It's been a blast to play and so far I haven't felt pressure to spend money in order to enjoy the game. You can pay to make it easier, but there's no point because the fun is in the challenge!",tag:(p2w)
Plenty of fun can be had without even touching the microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"A bite sized fire emblem, great for light entertainment on the go. Waaaaay simpler than the console titles, but that's to be expected. Microtransactions are thankfully entirely optional, and I've been enjoying the game without them.",tag:(p2w)
"Orbs cost 5 times more than they should, but it has solid f2p gameplay without being totally in your face with microtransactions. No pay to win really since the only thing you can do with orbs is summoning.",tag:(p2w)
"Absolutely fun and addicting. Without a doubt the best free mobile game I've ever played, and sure paying a few bucks speed up the process. But as someone who refuses to partake in microtransactions, I feel like I'm am at no quantifiable disadvantage whatsoever. Five stars every day of the week, massive hit!",tag:(p2w)
It's a good time waster. If you pace yourself you don't need microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
I normally hate mobile games. This is the first one to keep my interest and not screw me with microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"This game has continued to go downwards after every event. There is no rime or reason for the color wheel amymore as any random character no matter if he should be weak against you can kill your character in one hit. The amount of stamina is now 99 because instead of fixing the balance they just give you more tries and each day a bottle of stamina. Pathetic development from such a big name in gaming.   The microtransactions are way too expensive and if it wasn't for the launch extra's people will be illprepared for late game stuff.  In about 2 weeks the game gets stale. Progress stops completely and you are forced to grind mindlessly in battle tower.  However even with that said the game is fun. Gives you lots to do at the start with only a little stamina being used. Stamina is needed to do battles. Later the battles are way tougher and a bit unfair at times.  I recommend to do the training tower as much as possible to outlevel quests and only summon when you have 20 orbs. Because battle tower is basically all you will do.   Make sure you have well balanced amount of coloured characters. If the summon does not have the colours you need, rather use the first 5 and the leave. Get 5 more and try again later.",tag:(p2w)
"This is one of the only free-to-play games with microtransactions that doesn't feel like I'm blocked from accomplishing anything in the game. It's not ""pay-to-win"" by any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend it.",tag:(p2w)
"The game itself is very well made because you don't rely on the gacha style to get many heroes, neither to use microtransactions, only if you can play good enough to complete the challenges that gives you the good stuff. Recommend it if you like Fire Emblem or some game to kill (a lot) of time.",tag:(p2w)
"I enjoyed the game itself, but farming to get a good character can be a chore, I tried 20+ times and either got a five star character that I would never use, or I got all 3 stars. Although, after a lot of patience I did get a set by was happy with, but the struggle did put a damper on my experience. Apart from that, great game. I haven't gotten very far in, but as far as I got, it was a really fun experience. Of course it has microtransactions, but it's a free mobile game and pretty much everyone was expecting that. Overall, this is a really good game and I really recommend you give it a go.",tag:(p2w)
"The classic Fire Emblem I know and love. And completely free to play! (There are microtransactions, but you don't need them)",tag:(p2w)
"Well executed for a free-to-play game. The microtransactions don't feel like a ""requirement"" to keep enjoying the game either.",tag:(p2w)
"I wasn't expecting anything good but Nintendo is really proving themselves with their mobile games, this game is deeper than it might seem and has a lot to offer, only downside to me are the microtransactions, Nintendo games usually have an option for paying only once, this game just has microtransactions, but they are not neccesary if you are willing to be patient.",tag:(p2w)
"It was good at first, but the events have had their difficulty cranked up and summon rates have been drastically lowered, so collectors like myself aren't getting a great deal. Game mechanics are stripped down from the handheld versions, which isn't a deal breaker for me, but it'd be good for a true mobile port in future that isn't riddled with microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"Overall great game. The microtransactions are a little bit pricey but you get many orbs, which are used to summon additional heroes fairly easy early on. Story is okay but it does relate to the franchise and has a nice charm to it. Would recommend highly.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions destroyed this game . You must pay to get fire emblem icons. I wish if they let us pay once to get the whole characters and experience,tag:(p2w)
This is probably one the best mobiles games with microtransactions out there.,tag:(p2w)
"Best mobile game, really feels like a Fire Emblem game. Also, no reason for microtransactions. I've been playing for months and no shortage of anything has happened.",tag:(p2w)
"It's a mobile game. A highly polished mobile game. But bland, repetitive and microtransactions are heavily insentified. People could enjoy this but if you're a real gamer this will look like a glitter covered turd. Pretty but not fun to play with.",tag:(p2w)
"I don't always leave a review, but when I do, it will be for a game that goes beyond my expectations and delivers a great experience. This is one of the most generous f2p game I've played and I never felt like I absolutely have to pay to keep up. I don't usually engage in microtransactions, but in this case, I feel like the devs do deserve my support. After they proved they are willing to communicate with the player base and be transparent with the direction of the game, I decided to plop down a few dollars to show my support and leave this review. I hope the game maintains its current generosity and really show how a gacha game doesn't need to gouge their players for money while still turning a good profit.",tag:(p2w)
An amazingly fun way to get into the FE universe and great to pick up and play throughout the day. An addictive freemium game that is not overbearing with their microtransactions. I'd say they are consistent with allowing players to earn in game currency at a reasonable rate,tag:(p2w)
Spend 120 orbs? Get a load of trash and two unremarkable 5* units. The rates are incredibly lame for microtransactions so costly. Nobody should have to spend money on entertainment and feel bad about it.,tag:(p2w)
Why are the microtransactions more like macro transactions?! Costs are getting out of control on mobile games.,tag:(p2w)
Lots of fun even with microtransactions everywhere,tag:(p2w)
"Super fun game to pass the time with. Not much work is needed to get through it and the whole thing is easily playable without needing to put in any microtransactions. The only issue I have is how difficult getting/needing 20,000 Hero Feathers is (needed to get a silver hero to a gold one). I also wish that I could put Nintendo Account coins to more use in this app (maybe add more/differnt rewards). All in all a great game that with the right amount of patience has no big takeaways.",tag:(p2w)
"Is a solid game, one of the best on mobile. However, this game makes it a bit to hard to get orbs after the first few days. And microtransactions kinda suck.",tag:(p2w)
I didn't think the Fire Emblem formula could be condensed so well but here it is. Even the microtransactions aren't too bad.,tag:(p2w)
"It's fantastic at first... Freemium tho. What would you expect. Its basically a fire emblem advertisement. Campaign is short, beatable in about a week and a half if you have a good team. I got lucky and drew five star characters left and right to start out, others probably aren't as lucky. He dies very fast. Nothing to do anymore. Uninstalling if more things aren't added. Also the game later on is ridiculously impossible for a standard team. I have three five stars and a well developed four star and can't even touch lunatic. It takes like 7 missions to get 1 level so how am I expected to even approach lunatic? Oh I got it. Throw your wallet away. Which I understand, they need some way to attract microtransactions, but at least make it possible to get by without dumping $100 just to grab a 5 star. They don't even have a guaranteed five star for buying any sort of orbs. You pay money to get a pile of three star and four star garbage that won't help you past world 2 of hard.",tag:(p2w)
"Fun blend of typical Mobile Game mechanics (stamina per day, microtransactions) and a solid (not deep) Fire Emblem feel (turn based strategy RPG)",tag:(p2w)
"The microtransactions aren't necessary, but you're going to buy them anyways. The heroes you get from that are also going to be completely useless, but for some reason you won't mind.  It's weird.",tag:(p2w)
"As a longtime fan of Fire Emblem, I absolutely love this. Characters, weapons, music, and updated art from multiple games across the series is a great sight to behold. Classic & simplified tactical FE gameplay in short bursts that's just enough to keep you entertained. The random/duplicate elements of the microtransactions are annoying, but the game never forces you to make purchases (in a way, it helps fund more future FE content!) Overall, a great entry that will please longtime fans as well as bringing in new ones to this amazing series.",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions aren't in your face. Simple compared to main series Fire Emblem, but great if you want bite sized pieces of tactics.",tag:(p2w)
"Although this isn't a true Fire Emblem game, it's an addictive one atleast. Gameplay is fun and microtransactions have never gotten in the way of it. It's one of the few mobile games that's worth spending hours on.",tag:(p2w)
"Awesome game! Runs great, plays great, earn plenty of items without having to rely on microtransactions to win and play !",tag:(p2w)
This is a good game for fans to play when they can't afford every release. It offers a taste of what Fire Emblem  is about in a convenient package where microtransactions aren't necessary for enjoyment.,tag:(p2w)
Very cute characters and a perfect balance between microtransactions and actual gameplay!,tag:(p2w)
"EVERYTHING is on a timer system, there is nothing in the game that one can simply grind while waiting for stamina, or duel crests, or orbs. Gameplay is limited to the 2 minutes youll have the resources you'll actuallg play the game. I would gladly pay a flat fee to never have to wait on timers again, but its a system where you constantly have to refuel with microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"Bad with the microtransactions for heroes, nevertheless a great game.",tag:(p2w)
"Very much a ""one more turn"" game like FE has been long known to be. Simple, pretty, fun, and not too exploitive for a game with microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"Gameplay is slightly better than your standard phone fare but still with all the typical pay-to-win extras. The story is nothing to get excited about but, again, that's true for most mobile games. Seems like a cash grab for nostalgia but it's one of the better ones for that, and good for mindless fun if you don't get suckered into the microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"FEH is, in its basic functions, exactly what a Fire Emblem Mobile game should be. It takes classic gameplay and simplifies it to fit in a handheld device, and doesn't do it in a clunky and obvious way. It doesn't try to be a fully-fledged Fire Emblem game, because it doesn't need to be, and there is something to be said for a company wise enough to realize that.  That said, it isn't perfect. The stamina bar can get pretty crippling at higher levels, gold-rank characters are absurdly imbalanced, orbs are slow to come by after the story missions have been done, making it a very slow process to try to get the one character you desperately want, and the microtransactions just don't quite give you your money's worth.  It also lacks almost all of my favorite characters from recent FE games (Rinkah, Mozu, Charlotte, Severa, and less recently, Bors and Forde!) But most important is the fact that the devs LISTEN TO THEIR FANS! When there was outcry against the stamina system they actually made adjustments! And that deserves some mad respect.",tag:(p2w)
Loving this game so far. Enjoyable without being too difficult.  Doesn't feel like you have to pay for microtransactions in order to enjoy the game. Hope it stays this way.,tag:(p2w)
"It's playable without microtransactions! Considering it's free, it's a solid game. It just feels like you're missing out if you're not spending money, however.",tag:(p2w)
"It's Fire Emblem Lite, with optional microtransactions. Other than hero feathers (non-premium item) being hard to come by in large numbers, it seems to work well so far!",tag:(p2w)
"This game is very fun for a fire emblem fan! However, the microtransactions are WAY too steep. I'd buy a whole lot more orbs if they didn't cost 6 dollars for 2 hero rolls...",tag:(p2w)
A solid game for a phone. Microtransactions are not too intruding. Combat is simple to grasp.  A good place to start for new fans of the series as well as a faithful adaptation of the series for long time fans.,tag:(p2w)
"Let`s make sure all of you know the true story about this game, because it is heavily overglorified. Let me start off with the fact that it is a fun game, no matter how you look at it, and it does give off the proper Fire Emblem feeling even though it has some small changes. The early game is great! You can play a lot, you have a lot of refills on stamina and arena tickets and Orbs are collected rather easily. Great! Graphics are just fine, and voices are good too, but who cares about that anyway.  Here is the thing that cuts off 2/3 stars, and let me say this in a simple manner: There is SO MUCH wrong with this game once you enter endgame. Endgame in this pretext means ~lvl 35+, where you probably finished both the story on normal and hard.  So let me tell you the biggest mistake: Not enough freaking stamina! What were they thinking? As you go higher into the stories or other dungeons or whateverbyou want to call them, the stamina cost rises with it, but you own stamina DOESN`T, this means you still have 50 stam, but you have to use 15~20 EACH LEVEL. So you play for 10 min, and then u gottan wait 4 hours to play another 10 min. 3 (or 4) words: Orbs are BS! They are literally almost unobtainable because you can barely play, it doesn`t make any sense, it is the main currency or item in the game but the scarcity is so great it feels like they are forcing microtransactions on you. This also goes for Feathers and shards/crystals and those colored things you need for upgrading your heroes (forgot what its called). So yeah, forced microtransactions For The Win. Third, and probably the most annoying is the leveling system for the endgame. When your hero dies, he loses all exp gained that level no matter if you win or lose, nd let me tell you, when your foghting lvl35+ battles, you almost always just barely win and probably only 1 hero survives, so so leveling your hero becomes so pathetically tedious, it`s just incredible how they even thought of it. Also, arena is completely and utterly useless. I still gave it a 3☆ because the game itself is really fun, and because of the potential it still has. I saw on the internet than they plan to make DLC stories every month or so, but its the internet after all, so im a little reluctant to believe it. Thats about the most honest review i can give you.",tag:(p2w)
"It's fun and faithful to the combat system of Fire Emblem for the most part, but the lack of a way to grind for orbs show that this has gone beyond the other gacha games in terms of trying to force people to pay in order to get what they want to get. I can't summon the heroes I want because I can't get any more orbs except from events and from paying money. This isn't the way to handle microtransactions, Nintendo. Just add a map on which you get an orb from every time you kill it, but every time you do, the enemies in it goes up a level. Then have this refresh every day or so. Then people will be playing this game constantly, and those frustrated with grinding can pay for extra orbs, extra stamina potions, extra level up materials, etc.  Just give us a way to get orbs without it being a finite resource.",tag:(p2w)
"Personally, I really enjoy this game but.. On my phone it crashes fairly often. I own a LG leon.  The stamina consumption to recovery is a bit unbalanced, it would be much better if players didn't need to wait for an hr or more to recover it, or use microtransactions either. If the recovery rate is changed, that would be great.  I also believe it would be cool to have specific maps to earn the crystals (red, green, blue etc..) for drawing out potential.   Thanks for reading, -your fire emblem fan.",tag:(p2w)
The game is wonderful but a bit confusing when it comes to summoning or what the particular points are for. Make sure that you have a guide ready for small questions. Very addicting and does not require you to spend microtransactions on extra stuff. Your patience and diligence can save you money. Enjoy every moment of this game,tag:(p2w)
"This is a great way to introduce newcomers to the Fire Emblem series! Gameplay is simplified, but that's OK for a mobile game. Microtransactions are there, but rarely intrusive. Best of all, there is not much waiting time to play again.",tag:(p2w)
Stamina and microtransactions defeat the possibility of having fun just playing a game. I would pay $20 for something from Nintendo that did not have any grinding or stamina mechanic.,tag:(p2w)
"Absolutely love the game. I've played Fire Emblem titles on various consoles, and this is a nice lite version of it. I do hope bigger maps will eventually be created, and characters can be unlocked by fulfilling specific requirements (like in the original games, standing on a certain tile or beating a character with a certain other character).  One issue: microtransactions.  $75 for a large amount of Orbs (used to RNG for more characters)? For that money, I expect to have access to everything in the game, not some dice rolls in hopes of getting a few features.",tag:(p2w)
A slimline version of Fire Emblem made perfectly for Mobile. Free to Play with plenty of content and no need for microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"A fun time-killer with chess-like gameplay (for those unfamiliar with TRPGs), collectible characters from the Fire Emblem series, and regular updates and content additions.  Microtransactions are a bit pricey, considering how central team composition is to gameplay. I've noticed a deficit of viable green characters, and certain heroes (Takumi, Lyn) are in need of rebalancing. Hopefully the devs will care about fine-tuning the multiplayer experience and not just sit on the (tempting!) microtransaction income.",tag:(p2w)
"Perfect all around. It's still a mobile game with microtransactions, but it is the best of it's kind by far!",tag:(p2w)
"Game is great, but all the monetization around it? Not so much. Would love to pay an upfront price (a la Mario Run) if that meant dodging the microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"This game is great for those who are new to FE and returning fans, but this game suffers from that old mobile curse, that of microtransactions. The game is playable without spending a dime, but it gets so incredibly grindy after a mere 3 hours as the orbs required for summoning new characters are given out rather sparcely unless you decide to shell out a few bucks. I don't think I will be playing this for very much longer as a result since I do not plan on spending a single dime on the microtransactions, but it is fun in the meantime. TL;DR: I would've much rather payed to download the app than have the game include these microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
Great game. Items needed to evolve and collect heroes are a bit hard to obtain outside of microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"The controls can be slippery for some coming in from traditional Fire Emblem titles, but that's nothing major.  For now it's not too in your face with microtransactions... You could use your default characters, but if you want a favorite or want to place in monthly events, you may have to pony up cash for orbs.  At least you get some discount for summoning five units from the same stone set.",tag:(p2w)
Very nice game! Great game to introduce new Fire Emblem players to sans the microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions and slot machine gambling. It gets an extra star only because it's Fire Emblem and fairly polished.,tag:(p2w)
"It would be an amazing game if it wasn't designed to get money out of you. Really good controls and perfectly smooth. It's cool at the beginning, but suddenly around lvl 15 or so, it grinds to a halt. Either you do a lot of grinding and waiting, or start spending money. The difficulty curve is adjusted to make you happy at the beginning and then make you pay to continue. Completely destroys the fun. And that's a shame, because I'd be happy to pay for this game if it wasn't microtransactions oriented.",tag:(p2w)
Near perfect gameplay experience. The only thing i don't really like is the quite high prices on the microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"Copying a lot of gatcha games, FE heroes fails to deliver by adding incredible grinding mechanics ( good luck getting 20k feathers) and limiting the amount of summoning orbs you can get for free to a finite amount (till you beat all chapters on all 3 difficulties) before you are forced to start paying microtransactions to get new units",tag:(p2w)
"If microtransactions HAVE to be in modern games, this is a PERFECT way to include them. The entire game is playable without spending a dollar, if this is the calibre of game Nintendo will release to mobile, sign me up for even more!",tag:(p2w)
"Amazing game, microtransactions done super well. A great game to get into the franchise with",tag:(p2w)
Super-polished and already contains so much to do. I appreciate the My Nintendo support and actually seeing Nintendo's name attached to something with achievements. The microtransactions are too steep though in my opinion.,tag:(p2w)
"This game is about as fun as the older Fire Emblems. It's a bit less tactical, but pretty good for a mobile game. The voiceovers are passable, and the graphics are pleasing. There's no permadeath, which is good because I actually didn't like that aspect about the pre-Awakening games. HOWEVER; This game is freemium. They've temporarily shortened the stamina costs to make it seem more playable without microtransactions, but after the 19th, enjoy your 4.5 HOUR waits for your stamina to regenerate after you play for 20-40 minutes. I thought I was going to like this game. It's hard to like a game you can't play.",tag:(p2w)
"Very polished, very fun.  Only downside is that it's F2P with microtransactions instead of a full entry.",tag:(p2w)
I spent $20 on microtransactions then i found out about hard resetting gg rip 20 aud.  UPDATE I ROLLED TAKUMI  YEAH THE BOYS,tag:(p2w)

"Simple, fun and doesnt shove microtransactions down my throat every chance it gets, unlike 99percent of the google play store apps.",tag:(p2w)
Sneaky move prompting me to rate the game right after I pull 5 star Camilla... You got me. It's dumbed down fire emblem with microtransactions and the usual mobile game addiction-fostering mechanics. But that's what I was expecting so I can't be mad.,tag:(p2w)
Great ftp game. Microtransactions are fair and not too abusive. Might get boring for long sessions but having fun so far!,tag:(p2w)
"It's a really solid Fire Emblem game. I wish I could just buy the game. I'm not really a fan of microtransactions, but you can pretty easily get by without paying with this game.",tag:(p2w)
"Great for a small dose of fire emblem. The game play is well designed and feels like a smaller version of the main games. The microtransactions are disgustingly overpriced, charging over $2 per hero in a game with dozens of heroes. Getting a 3* variant is worthless as well,  as 5* heroes are double or triple their strength once leveled. Stamina system is forced and pointless, simply a pain point to encourage you to waste valuable orbs. They drop heroes daily,  but they are 1* or 2* in strength and are essentially worthless,  plus it's only the same 12 in a loop,  and not everyone, so within 2 weeks you'll have all the freebies.  Overall fun for a bit, but poorly thought out micro transactions and even worse balance between a paying/soft resetting player vs an honest one in their arena mode really holds it back from what could be the perfect mini fire emblem.",tag:(p2w)
"Translates very well into mobile, the microtransactions are not that bad...",tag:(p2w)
Pocket Fire Emblem. Great time sink for fans. Microtransactions are not invasive at all so that's nice for once!,tag:(p2w)

"All your favorite Fire Emblem heroes at the palm of your hand! Just watch out for those microtransactions, the search for your favorites can be very expensive. The gameplay is a mini version of the same FE battle system we all know so it's all there.",tag:(p2w)
"The first few hours are fun,  lots of progression but it very quickly becomes a boring grind-fest with very tedious progression to persuade you to spend a bunch of money on microtransactions.  The story is almost non-existent.  Progression in story mode gets blocked by the snail's pace of your characters leveling which again pushes payment to continue.    There isnt enough map variety to keep you entertained through the grind either. My suggestion is just play the story mode till you can't continue and then uninstall it.",tag:(p2w)

"Honestly, not just because I love fire emblem, but this has gotta be one of the most well polished and amazing mobile games out there microtransactions never feel necessary and it's just honestly incredibly fun.",tag:(p2w)
"While it was expected to be simplified in some aspects like removing hits, crits, smaller teams and maps, it commendable they still managed to make a decent mobile game of a beloved franchise in a sea of trashware that drowns the mobile games industry. It has microtransactions, sure, but it doesn't feel the  paywall is a behemoth to bypass legally",tag:(p2w)
So far so good it's perfect for people who love strategy games. I have yet to see any blatant advertisements for microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
Nothing compared to a full game but a nice little game for fun built around BS tactics to encourage microtransactions. Rather buy a full game.,tag:(p2w)

It's basically a somewhat condensed Fire Emblem game with some microtransactions replacing the perma-death feature.,tag:(p2w)
"It's a really well done execution of Fire Emblem on mobile. The gatchapon elements are well-done, but the microtransactions are mega steep. Which is both discouraging from just buying a ton of heroes - a good thing, but also makes the game feel predatory. It's a weird balance, and I was very cynical of it, but as a game - and especially as a Fire Emblem game - I'm really enjoying it.",tag:(p2w)
Sooo fun. Only real complaint i have which isnt actually a complaint but the auto battle makes your heroes play super dumb. Also microtransactions are hella expensive. I wouldnt mind paying but £6 for 10 orbs? Thats £3 a hero which is just too expensive. Ofc you can earn all orbs legit but just saying how microtransactions are super expensive. Great game none the less,tag:(p2w)
I'm a big fire emblem fan and this does not disappoint.Game feels fair and microtransactions are there but it's not pay to win like some other mobile games out there.Game mechanics are the same as any other fire emblem game and it's really alot of fun,tag:(p2w)

"Nothing highlights the predatory, manipulative aspects of the freemium model quite as adeptly as Fire Emblem Heroes.  The stamina required to finish a level goes up rapidly, so you're using one-fifth of it per level by the time you get to chapter 8. Enemies also become damage sponges, so you either get lucky getting five-star heroes early on or spend a ton of time grinding (wasting even more stamina in the process). This is required because there's no actual strategy here. Units have almost no mobility, only being able to move 2 or 3 squares, so levels are just you and the enemy smashing against each other instead of maneuvering units cleverly. The color-coded weapon triangle only matters early on; by the time you get to the later chapters, your weaker units will be doing 0 damage even with that advantage, and the only ones who work are the stronger summoned heroes.  There's no strategy involved in any of this, the writing is Fates-tier garbage, and it's obviously designed to push you toward microtransactions. Awakening supposedly saved the franchise, but if this is the future of Fire Emblem, I can't help but think it would have been better to let it die.",tag:(p2w)
"Good game, hate microtransactions though. To bad its just 4v4 on 8x8",tag:(p2w)
"The game it's Allright, very addictive but I would like to pay a full game than microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"Really gorgeous game for mobile with a lot of great character art. Stages are fairly simple, but the overall character and upgrade system is fairly complex.   The limitations that would encourage microtransactions seem fairly generous, and there are bonus items and whatnot that you can earn for free to restore it. If you would complain about the mere existence of microtransactions in a free game, you're an idiot.   All in all something I need to see more of, but it's a brilliantly polished little game.",tag:(p2w)
It's the perfect Fire Emblem game for the Casual audience hardcore Gamers won't like the simplistic or should I say simplification of the gameplay and some other hardcore Fire Emblem heads would disagree this is a fire emblem game for both casual and hardcore fans blending Timeless roster of Fire Emblem characters from old to new and considering microtransactions don't nerve a PVP match I would definitely say this app is awesometacular👏,tag:(p2w)
With the exclusion of microtransactions this is a great game while I'll never pay money for progress I love fire emblem,tag:(p2w)
"Excellent game; I wasn't a fan of Fire Emblem before but I'm absolutely loving this game. The gameplay is fun and addictive, and the microtransactions are subtle and not necessary. The fact that you can't play it offline is a massive shame, but other than that it's definitely worth a try!",tag:(p2w)
"For a mobile game, this is very solid. It is more or less watered down fire emblem, with a bunch of optional microtransactions. The game runs smoothly and is overall well-polished. As with most of these types of games, obtaining the main currency without resorting to actually paying money can be fustrating. But that being said, the rates for getting a five star hero is actually quite generous, so more often than not you will be rewarded for your efforts.",tag:(p2w)
Great game so long as you don't mind microtransactions. Great game if you like fire emblem as I do but the game feels much slower than a real fire emblem title due to the stamina system which forces you to wait or buy potions. It's still a fun game so long as your patient and the summoning system is addicting as well.,tag:(p2w)
"This game has great art, very good mobile gameplay. It's simplified Fire Emblem, maps are smaller and you can only have 4 units per team but it is still quite engaging and there is a lot to do.  There is microtransactions but you can earn premium currency whilst playing, at least at the start. It's also kinda random what you will get.  There is still a weapon advantage triangle and strategy involved. The graphics are very well made and run well on mobile phones whilst staying sharp. First impressions are great!",tag:(p2w)
I love the fire emblem series.  This addition to series does not dissapoint. Well done mobile game by nintendo. My only complaints is that as with most mobile games i would have rathered payed $10-$20 dollars for this instead of having microtransactions.  You can play this game without microtransactions since unlocking a hero is not terribly exspensive.  Only 5 ingame currency which isnt hard to gain at first as long as you progress through the story. First hero i unlocked was a 5 star so lucky me but the ratio for the heros is okay. 58% to unlock teir 3 heros.,tag:(p2w)
"It's a phone game through and through, it is all fun and games at the start but then you notice how much stamina you burn through how that replaying missions is never worth it how like all phone games it tries it's best to make you buy into microtransactions, overall this game is a fanservice disservice of the real games. It would be nice if people stopped rewarding this nonsense with auto 5 stars this is no where near a 4 star game. Another negative there is no dual audio too which is annoying to not have.",tag:(p2w)
Fire Emblem meets microtransactions but done well. You can get a lot done without ever spending a single real dollar.,tag:(p2w)
"A true Fire Emblem game, expansive and entertaining. The only negative aspect about the game is the steep price of the microtransactions, the prices on offer are much steeper than a usual online transaction based RPG. 4/5 it is still very fun.",tag:(p2w)
"Fantastic so far. Short and addictive battles, really smooth game play and I've been playing for hours without a single need or even a prompt for any microtransactions! Really impressed.",tag:(p2w)
One word. Microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"Great game, doesn't cram microtransactions down your throat.",tag:(p2w)
"A nice game. The microtransactions are expensive, but overall a solid game.",tag:(p2w)
Really great adaptation of the original game for mobile. Very beginner friendly. Although it's a freemium game microtransactions are definitely not needed to complete the story.,tag:(p2w)
"Jeez, it's no true Fire Emblem, but even for a free to play with microtransactions, it's more than fair and the stamina system is very forgiving thus far. I haven't had to take a break after an hour of gameplay, so that's a pretty big deal. Nintendo did a wonderful job with this little gem.",tag:(p2w)
"It's decent for a mobile game. It has microtransactions, which is something I never want in my fire emblem. The sprites are SUPER low quality for a fire emblem game, and the ""combat scenes"" use the bad sprites instead of the better looking animations common to fire emblem. Instead we get art of the characters sliding against eachother. All in all it's a solid mobile game, but just get a proper fire emblem game it's so much better.",tag:(p2w)
"Thanks for not going down the evil path of microtransactions, Nintendo. This is very fun.",tag:(p2w)
"This game is a huge improvement over Miitomo. It leaves you coming back for more without scamming you into buying more microtransactions, even though that is an option.",tag:(p2w)
"Suprised me, a lot of fun to be had with this Mobil versión. Let's hope the microtransactions stay fair.",tag:(p2w)
"Addicting, fun, and it doesn't force the microtransactions on you like other game. A nice way to play a small round of Fire Emblem without the large amount of time needed in the main series of games. I love it.",tag:(p2w)
"Although I was skeptical at first, because, well, microtransactions, this game has done service to those, me included, who loved the old games",tag:(p2w)
"Fire emblem fan, pleasantly surprised how well this game has been treating me so far. Artwork is refreshing and varied, music is great and has some well remixed classics. Easy to pick up, easy to put down, easy to come back too. Microtransactions are very reasonable in that the game supplies you with a reasonable amount of freemium currency just by playing the game.",tag:(p2w)
"Totally blew me out of the water. Amazing graphics with the classic fire emblem gameplay. There are microtransactions but they are not needed to play the game even on the high levels. Everything is obtainable for free through quests, missions and daily logins, but more slowly of course. Love it!",tag:(p2w)
"The game is amazing and very well made. I didn't encounter any bugs or connection errors. It's a shame it's energy/stamina based and there are obviously quite a lot of microtransactions, but it's still playable (at least for now) and lots of fun.  Edit: Lowered my score by two stars because the stamina cost really is too high for later missions. Makes it impossible to play longer than 15-20 minutes at a time unless you're willing to spend money on it, which is ridiculous.",tag:(p2w)
A great mini-fire emblem game. Microtransactions do not seem intrusive (currently at a few hours of play) and the actual battles are fun 4V4 FE missions.,tag:(p2w)
"Pretty cool. Disappointed that the game is present with microtransactions and stamina (yuck). However, it's a great game, nevertheless.",tag:(p2w)
"Fun game so far, classic Fire Emblem feel and not pushing microtransactions in your face like most mobile games. Definitely looking forward to how this game updates.",tag:(p2w)
"Ive only had the pleasure of playing Fire Emblem Awakening in the series, and couldn't flaw that game. For a free mobile game, this title is an essential for anyone remotely into FE. From what I can see too, there is no pressure on microtransactions, which is awesome!",tag:(p2w)
A little too aggressive with the microtransactions. But a great game!,tag:(p2w)
too many microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
Full of microtransactions. Which get annoying pretty easily,tag:(p2w)
Too many requests for microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"Fun, frustrating, addictive. My only grief is with the constant pushing of microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"The earlier levels are a fun time-waster, but the later ones become nearly impossible without boosters. I'd rather play a game that isn't constantly breathing down my neck about microtransactions, thanks.",tag:(p2w)
Some of the levels are clearly designed by a mentally challenged person. Either that or to milk you for microtransactions. Shameful display either way.,tag:(p2w)
The game tells me that I have no more moves left. Yet I can see on my screen that I have multiple moves still left to use. The game also does not like it when you move the balls that are not lighting up. If you are smart and do the opposite what the game wants you to do you get punished. Not impressed one bit. Edit: Uninstalled. This game is complete garbage. When Devs stop cheating the players for microtransactions then maybe I'll reconsider reinstalling it.,tag:(p2w)
"Like all games these days its all about microtransactions and gambling. All games like this should be banned and developers should be fined millions for fraud. It is not free if you have or the option to spend real money on something that gives nothing back in return that benifits the player permanently for the rest of the duriation of the game, even if its endless. You could still make all your money by making the game $0.99 and having you earn in game money, that will never ask for real money.",tag:(p2w)
"Controls do not always work if you move all the way left or right. The end of level slides for the multiplier works sometimes but for the most part it will bounce you off for no reason. And finally the ads in this game are out of control. An ad for starting the level, finishing the level, and ads for nothing. TLDR: Garbage that barely works and will drive you insane with ads.",tag:(ads)

To many ads my kids get scared of some of these ads,tag:(ads)
I give this game a 2 Star because first it is SUPER laggy and there was ads after you complete a stage and my phone is never laggy and I think you should put ads after every 10 to 11 stage so there not to many ads,tag:(ads)

Pretty simple game but the mindless fun is really broken by the amount of ads. In general if I like a game I will pay to remove ads but with this one i probably ended up watching more ads in the first half dozen levels than actually playing the game so the $3.49 was a tough sell,tag:(ads)
It's sooooo laggy and there are soooo many ads!! Other than that... It is a fun game... But I did unfortunately uninstall this app. Try it... You may love it 🤗,tag:(ads)

This game was so laggy and too many ads it also made my phone freeze this doesn't happen to me with other apps I suggest that you make changes immediately because this game was horrible and made my phone have problems I would give this 0 stars but I can't so I gave it 1 I'm dissatisfied this app is a mistake!,tag:(ads)

"2. Because when I played the game it was all going good, overall there WAS a lot of ads and when I started to get to a far into the game I got stuck on this one level NOT BECAUSE I WAS TRASH. Because every time I hit that one spot my game would automatically crash And lag causing my phone to freeze. I don't have this problem with any other game. Also there's also problem with the ads There is WAY to much ads. Such a shame I had to give this game a 2 rating it was a pretty good game at first.",tag:(ads)

"I want to like this. The concept is fun and simple. But my good god the ADS you will be hit with an ad after EVERY level, your screen is SWAMPED with buy gems stuff, and if you hit an ad mid level that means you auto get a x20 but it doesnt stop you from getting YET ANOTHER DAMN AD at the end of the level.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone you are forced to have a kind of WiFi connection or data so you can be bombarded with ads and it's too repetitive and I got bored in 5 minutes of playing this is the worst game I have ever played,tag:(ads)

"Pointless. There's essentially no way to fail, no real challenging gameplay, and HOLY ADS. Ridiculous.

If you want a challenging game with little to no ads... try Odd Bot Out. Great puzzle game.",tag:(ads)
I usually never rate any app but this game made me do it.So basically the game is garbage and it makes you watch ads more than it lets you play the actual game.I strongly recommend you not to install it. You literally cant play the game if you disable internet it forces you to enable it just so it can spam ads again.I hope this game dies soon and its developers aswell.thank you goodbye,tag:(ads)

I don't like Because ads😡😡,tag:(ads)

"The game gets boring kinda quick but is fun most of the time, if you dont want ads you can just turn your mobile data or wifi off so it's easier to get no ads",tag:(ads)
Ads literally block game play.,tag:(ads)
"More ads than gameplay. You can't play this game with out Internet, so there's no way of avoiding the ads unless you pay a fee. You play for maybe 10 secs than have to watch a 30 sec ad before playing again. Crazy.",tag:(ads)
Eh its ok the amount of ads is pathetic its ridiculous but over all good game. Possibly make the levels longer though,tag:(ads)
Who's giving this garbage app 5 stars it shouldn't cross 1 star it is like downloading a virus onto your phone no thanks uninstalled after 2 minutes when it refused to run off its ads but wanted to charge me.,tag:(ads)
Too much of ads. Dint knew ki ad dek raha hu ya khel raha hu frankly!,tag:(ads)

Game is the word how do people play this like it is so hard and it has super hard levels the horrible part is that it has so so so many ads like they take forever to be done so if I would give it five star if you people would fix it.😡😤😾💔TO MANY ADDS!,tag:(ads)
This game is really cool but that is automatically return to home screen. I don't know why? to play this game u have to connect to internet ... And lots of ads in there.... And i am really border at waiting 😑😑 to load this thing.. So I only give it 2 stars ⭐⭐..,tag:(ads)
I hate this game there is way to many ads I hate it delete it now,tag:(ads)
Too much ads,tag:(ads)
You pass 1 level and there is an ad. So many ads. Already deleted it,tag:(ads)
Awfull. Sorry. It's a game made for ads. The gameplay is everytime identical. Just the ads are changing.,tag:(ads)
I really like it. Here arnt a lot of ads.,tag:(ads)
"Ads, ads, ads, everywhere ads. I get it that you need to make money, but ads after everything you do?! For this I uninstalled the game",tag:(ads)

Too many ads . I cant enjoy the game so i unstalled it.,tag:(ads)
"Voodoo strikes again - nonstop ads, horrible app experience. Voodoo is THE WORST game developer on the Play store, and that's saying something. Two thumbs WAY down.",tag:(ads)
"If you want an easy game full of adds spread over the screen and in between levels, this is the game for you. The worst part? You have to be connected to the internet in order to play. You could pay $6 to remove the ads, but why? The levels offer no climb in difficulty, you need 5000 gems in order to randomly customise your little character, and getting those gems are easy as you always land on the 20x multiplier at the end.",tag:(ads)
There is an ad after EVERY LEVEL. I try turning off my WiFi but you babies scream and cry because you can't make money. I bought the no ads TWICE and got nothing!,tag:(ads)
The games has potential. But I spend way more time viewing ads than I do actually playing out. I'm going to keep playing Clash Royale👍🏾,tag:(ads)

Zero star. It has lots of ads.,tag:(ads)
All about the ads,tag:(ads)
"Pretty standard game with no actual level of difficulty, fun to play in the beginning but after like a few levels you realize that they are the same level over and over again. Although it could be avoided, you are demanded to have WiFi or data open during playing so that you can be spammed with ads after each level and even during playing a single level at some occasions. Would not suggest.",tag:(ads)
Only contains ads,tag:(ads)

"Too many ads, ruins the fun.",tag:(ads)
"I'm sick and tired of this app appearing as an ad on youtube on almost every video, and in the ad they have the balls to claim that a mobile game that will take about a day for a mid-tier game dev to make (probably only made to make money) filled to the brim with ads and microtransactions to maximize profits should even be compared with console games that cost millions of dollars to make , multiple years to develop, and hundreds of game devs putting passion into every little detail of the game.",tag:(ads)
Ads make it unbearable to play,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
"There are many things wrong with this game, and only one thing that I can think of that is kind of good. The one alright part of the games is that is a good/fun thing to do for a couple minutes when you are bored. However overall the game is pretty terrible, first there are ads basically constantly, and the expirience between them isn't even that enjoyable. Also for such a simple game it runs terrible and I don't really understand why. I think that it is clear that this is just to make money.",tag:(ads)
Great game I like the game because it's fun and has not so many ads like the other games a have but there is only 1 problem when I'm playing the game and having fun some times my screen glitches and it freezes but that happens like 6-7 time when I'm playing the ge but other all it's a great game and it's super fun! 10/10 great work 😁👍🏽,tag:(ads)
An ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL is so stupid. Plus on screen ads at the bottom. Game monetization has gotten worse and worse. And the game is not even worth the $3.50 to skip ads.,tag:(ads)
nice game there is no ads i like it thats why i give it 5 stars😍😍😍😍😍😍,tag:(ads)
"Like any game from VOODOO; Very easy, not impossible. The ads on Instagram make it look difficult but once you play it, you understand it's easiness. Another thing with VOODOO, a lot of ads. Banners when playing, ads in between levels, and rewards. ""Remove ads"" is always a scam when it comes to games, and this game isn't very entertaining. It's simplicity of design makes it run smooth, but it is just not good of a game. ~Foxx",tag:(ads)
"Worst game filled with tonned of ads, after every level they show the ad. Even we cant play without internet and this is not even online game. Ads are really frustrating.",tag:(ads)
"Too many ads,",tag:(ads)

"Game doesn't allow you to play if you don't have an internet connection. This is so they can show you their ads, which ads are constant and scammy.",tag:(ads)

Hey developers.This game is although fun but the ads are super annoying.I knew there was going to be ads when I completed like 3 or 2 levels in.Butttt.... when I cometed on level IT GAVE ME AN AD.Are you out of your mind? I went to install your game to play! NOT to watch your stupid ads. The reason the name is called GAME is to let people play it .But it's not called AD-Watcher Simulator. I understand you need to make money. But at least don't put a million ads. Please Read this.,tag:(ads)

It's pretty neat though $3 for ad removal might turn me off it later on. If only there was like a progression to ad removal factor that made it cheaper the farther you get because by that point you've watched x amount of ads,tag:(ads)

"the ads are somewhere between 2-3 longer than the levels and show after each level. if that wasn't enough, there's banner ads and window-in-window ads during gameplay as well. the gameplay itself is boring, unengaging, and doesn't change or evolve for at least the first 20 levels. it has the bones of a fun game, but it hasn't even constructed them into a skeleton",tag:(ads)
Please dont waste your time *this game is only made for watching add *all stages are like same *the game is only for age below 5 *watch ads more than playing a game * first is intresting then we can delete it. *nobody plays more than 20 stages * i think begging is better for this game creator... He is only make a ad app,tag:(ads)

Way too many ads after every level and they are 30 seconds long its quicker to turn the game of and start it again than it is to watch an ad I understand that this is the business model but after every level is a bit excessive. And you want 3.50 to disable ads that is just a game for when your bored no thanks.,tag:(ads)
TOO MANY ADS,tag:(ads)
just another pointless under programmed game by voodoo. This game has no sound and you spend more time watching ads than anything. They even stole doppelgangers of Rick and Morty to advertise this game which I can almost guarantee they didn't pay for,tag:(ads)
No more ads,tag:(ads)

"Its ok for about 30 combined minutes of playing it, afterwards there's no further progression and the levels don't increase in any difficulty. Once you've unlocked the ""skins"" there's nothing else to do. Unless they plan on actually improving the game I probably wouldn't waste my time on it. It's a shame to, I paid to remove the ads in hopes that the game would be better, I know better for next time I guess.",tag:(ads)

To many ads im done with with game ... smh!,tag:(ads)

This game only exists for ads. After the first 20 levels it just repeats and is very boring.,tag:(ads)
Great not too many ads,tag:(ads)

Too many ads and repeat levels.,tag:(ads)
"The free version is absolutely unplayable - just far too many ads. This is an interesting concept spoiled with boring ads for other games after just a few seconds of play. In fact, it feels like this is an ad machine with a game wrapped around it as an after thought. Guys, I get you need to make money for all your work, but the play: ad ratio is totally wrong and you've lost this customer as a result.",tag:(ads)
But the ads are to much,tag:(ads)
Ads after ads after ads. Don't wanna share your data. Banner telling you to share your data. Ads. Not worth it.,tag:(ads)

"Super buggy and Laggy. Predatory ads gear toward gullible children and women. I know, super redundant but I have to be detailed",tag:(ads)
While I'm all for ads in games to help support developers. Putting an ad after every single freaking level is just plain stupid. This game would easily get 4-5 Stars if the ads were spaced out every 15-20 minutes. Such garbage to do our after every level.,tag:(ads)
This game is nice to pass time it would be higher stars if there was less ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads. Game gets boring.,tag:(ads)

Lots of ads,tag:(ads)
Pretty good app i would recommend but one criticism:theres too many ads i know people use ads to make money but maybe a little less ads wouldn't hurt just a suggestion thank you.,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Ridiculous, ads after every level they're taking the piss",tag:(ads)

It has a lot of ads but the game is amazing :) You should download it,tag:(ads)
Too many ads. 2 ads in a row and a pop up literally in game. Ridiculous.,tag:(ads)

Too many ads and each level is same. Gets boring in just 10 minutes of game play.,tag:(ads)
"I've never seen a game with more ads. Ads in-game, ads just before you start playing the current level, ads after completing every level... But oh, the ads won't run when I want to open the treasure chests? The game would be fine if it wasn't for all these ads, all the time!",tag:(ads)
"Simple yet great concept. Too many ads. What would make this game a totally awesome one is instead of a level/stage base game, make it to an infinite game like everwing. The levels becomes boring overtime note really making a difficulty curve. Sometimes it becomes harder on a nudge sometimes it becomes easier than the previous stage.",tag:(ads)
Gameplay is a solid meh and the number of ads is ridiculous,tag:(ads)
I think it's awsomeee bc it's like SOO easy but much ads but idc bc this is fun but I wish it was hard cuz it's solo easyyyy so play it bc it's fun and not much ads and I have a channel so yea this game is awsome so play it and I love the skins check it out if you play this game and I DIED all the time but that's ok it's easy at the same time Play it for not free.,tag:(ads)

The amount of ads are insane. No thank you,tag:(ads)
"This is a cool game, definetly reccommend it... If you like the same thing over and over. Not a lot of ads but still not too little but not decent. I dont really like the game generally since not much changes each level. Atleast add modes, or online gameplays that would be cool.",tag:(ads)

I describe this as a five star game because it is fun and it has not a lot of ads and I just love this game. I have absolutely NO recommendations for this game. (Edit) I changed this rating to a 4 star because it just keeps doing the same level over. It is easy. I wish the game had harder levels. Still a good game though.,tag:(ads)
The Ads for this game are cancer,tag:(ads)

"App didn't work, tons of ads",tag:(ads)
"Nice game concept, uninstalled after a couple of minutes and an ad after every level for 5 levels in a row.

"To be honest, the concept is great. You will find it interesting for the first few levels (Remember to switch off network when playing to avoid those annoying ads). After playing over 100 levels, I am sure that levels are simply repeated without any new things. One star is because I hate games with that many ads without actually very good content.",tag:(ads)

It's a nice game. Tho I found it quite annoying that there's an ad after every game. Make it at least after 5 games when you put ads on. It makes the game less enjoyable when you have to wait a lot.,tag:(ads)

This game is really fun all though I bought the no ads gamepads and it's a RIP off when you can simply turn your wi-fi off.Id ont think its right to charge someone 3 bucks when they can do something else for free also the rounds are a little way more easier so I would recommend adding an easy mode and a hard mode just for the people who wanna play harder games or easier games and I LOVE THE SKINS!!You should add more skins and hats and clothes and change your avatar like roblox.But good game.,tag:(ads)

"Game has repetitive levels, not many skins and is impossible to get 20x diamonds are easy to get and they try to rack up ad revenue. Do not play any games from VOODOO anymore they are a money hungry company and makes a lot of money by ads because of there ad packed games. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Edit: the game has no point of being on the app store I'm tired of seeing the devs not replying to reviews. This game has appeared in ads, all over Facebook, and Instagram. Game is rubbish",tag:(ads)

"I played this game without Ads (Payed to remove them) It's a simple game, level's are not Very challenging and every character can be unlocked by level 50 or so. Mindless fun that doesn't last after level 100 due to repetitiveness and lack of content. The game could extend it's life if Ad revenue is used wisely to further develop content for the game, though i don't see this happening. (Prove me wrong Devs!)",tag:(ads)
Game is not really fun or challenging and to top it off the amount of ads is ridiculous. I spend more time forced to watch ads then actually playing the game.,tag:(ads)
There is just to many ads so 2 stars this gsme is fun its just so many ads,tag:(ads)
Very nice game just too many ads.sometimes u have to repeat levels I recommend playing offline like airplane mode,tag:(ads)
"This game is fun but then you get bored of it because of all the levels repeating. The ads are managable Because you can just turn your wifi off. No music or sound effects at all in this entire game so you have to listen to music while playing this. To change my opinion of this game, you will have to make more levels, add music or sound effects, and put less ads.",tag:(ads)
I can't play a game with ads after every level. More time on ads than playing the game is pathetic.,tag:(ads)

"Most unexpired game I've ever played. Legit every level feels the same level over and over in loop. With the bonus level in each 5 levels, its the same one each time making it rigged so you can't get that times 20 so they'll try and make you play longer for more ad revenue. They're just trying to make it drag even more so you can just watch ads over and over. Had it offline just to see if it's a decent game without ads popping up every second and I was bored like hell",tag:(ads)

I love this app VOODOO is being creative to make a game and also they make every game offline and free sometimes I really hate ads but I just ignore them then continue to play this game.

Honestly not a bad game. Good concept just not very welly executed with some of the levels. It's good for when you're bored out your mind and or in the bathroom. The ads are the worst thing of this game but that's it really. Even for that if you wanna go for a long session put on airplane mode.,tag:(ads)

"Voodoo seems to be an expert at creating fun games with nice concepts but that lack depth and so I end up uninstalling after a while, and that is okay because there are a lot of gaming options out there and I watched a good deal of ads for them. Short ads unless you go for the bonus. Not quite challenging enough and once you get all the characters the gems become useless, which affects gameplay. No sound unfortunately. Level 56 finally got too repetitive, but fun for a bit.",tag:(ads)

I like it but you might have to add like what y'all getting dressed up yes yeah so maybe you should probably just got us in there and then tell us the money when I had an update so that way we can have our at new obstacles like no boring off to goes there.

At first i thought givng them a chance play until 35 level but...i found out actually all level difficulties are same!so dont waste your time.. go find other exciting game.chao",tag:(ads)
Ads after every level. Deleted after the 4th ad. Why do developers do this to themselves. It's kinda sad,tag:(ads)
Just another mindless ad trap. The game is literally so easy there is no challenge and you just get bombarded with ads the whole time. I can't believe this is what phone games have come to.,tag:(ads)

The amount of ads is sick a imediatly deleted it,tag:(ads)
I enjoy the game. Its definitely a great time killed. Biggest issue is the amount of ads in the game. Be better to have one after every couple rounds instead of almost every round. Otherwise an overall fun game.,tag:(ads)

Another potential sale or at least a purchase of some power ups or something in a game that is loaded to a disgusting level with advertising . It never ceases to amaze me what money has done to the human race. You want people to try something out you have to make it difficult for him /her to perform well enough to form an honest opinion by bombarding them with ads and then Rate us Rate us .... Very little actual gameplay without the goddamn ads .,tag:(ads)
"Same as every other game on here. You get a 30 second ad every time you do anything. For every minute you play the game, you're watching 3 minutes of ads, not worth the time.",tag:(ads)

And if im going to be honest, its the ad for me, there are too much. After every level theres an ad. After i do the gift level, ANOTHER ADDDDD. Eould give a 5/5 but sorry...maybe if you changed this bug it could maybe be a 5/5. So for now, its a 3/5. I also uninstalled but i will be coming back to this game if the bug is fixed",tag:(ads)

Very good game since you turn off wifi for no ads in every round. Thw only problem is in every bonus round when your about to go to the last rail on the bonus round the cllouds block the way and you cant see the rail. And most likely you wont get 20x only 15x.

Way to many ads every level i complete ads shows up. Even though the game itself is fun. But the ads makes it lose your fun,tag:(ads)
The game is fine but when with or with out my Naruto mini play it pauses everytime you pass a level not even pass but everytime you start one. I like the game but the ads being there breathing down your neck like L investigating is annoying,tag:(ads)
Fun for the first few seconds. Too many ads.,tag:(ads)
Death by ads. No skill runner with limited creativity,tag:(ads)
Its a good agmeplay. Tho I do t like the controls on mobile and plus lower the ads of the app.,tag:(ads)
The pole at the end of a level no matter what you do will always be too small and the ads are everywhere and the gameplay is boring and repetitive,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
There are so many ads I can't get a break from it,tag:(ads)
Gets you hooked then plays ads every level,tag:(ads)
"Bad optimized, full of Unskipable ADS, boring",tag:(ads)
The game is a little boring because of how the game works along with ads and there is to many,tag:(ads)
Too many ads not fun to play,tag:(ads)
Fun game but no sound and ads after every level are annoying as hell. Ga-bye!,tag:(ads)
"The game is full of ads and the game experience sucks. There are some levels tjat prevent you from getting a full x20 multiplier like the placing a saw before a level ends that can't be avoided so instead of challenging yourself to get a high score on all levels, you just get frustrated.",tag:(ads)
"Could be good but contains tones of ads, have to wait for 29 seconds every time you fail a level",tag:(ads)
It's is a good game but it is way to many ads. When you try to press collect it takes you to an ad so this is a 3-5.,tag:(ads)
Way to many ads uninstalled more ads than game play,tag:(ads)
Nice game I have ever seen no ads,tag:(ads)
I loved to play this game but one thing.when I played sound gone I don't know how?another thing ads are removed.I played it for long time.I am bored of this game but also I gave it 4 stars.,tag:(ads)
To many ads,tag:(ads)
the multiple ads are unbearable,tag:(ads)
Too much ads don't install,tag:(ads)
Ads ads ads and more ads.,tag:(ads)

Too many ads,tag:(ads)
It's a time killer. But the ads after every game gets old really quick.,tag:(ads)
"Cool game, ads really killed it though",tag:(ads)
I really like the game i dont think it really has many ads but it really fun on the other hand.😁😄,tag:(ads)
"Terrible Ads ruin the game, there's too many good games with no Ads to be playing this junk",tag:(ads)
Got boring fasts and adverts after every round. You'll spend more time watching ads than you will playing.,tag:(ads)
It's pretty good for time wasting but the price for the ads is ridiculous $5 no way am I going to spend that when all I need to do is turn the internet off to stop the ads,tag:(ads)
"Extremely repetitive gameplay. I played through 50 levels and there were only 2 new gameplay elements added, one of which rarely ever appeared while the other one was in every level. This game is clearly just made for ad revenue, as ads pop up as soon as you beat a level. You can also watch ads to increase the amount of diamonds you get. I think the developers could have a pretty fun game if expanded upon, but it's obvious they won't. Very boring game.",tag:(ads)
Controls suck and too many ads,tag:(ads)
Way to many ads,tag:(ads)
Way too many ads.,tag:(ads)
The game was ok but the amount of ads to watch after each game ruins the fun,tag:(ads)
Only ads no game,tag:(ads)
Nice but ads,tag:(ads)
ADS ADS ADS...AND U GUESSED IT...MORE ADS,tag:(ads)
"It's a voodoo game they love ads, I left as the second ad started. Because it's too much.",tag:(ads)
ONLY PLAYED 4 ROUND and got VERY SICK AND TIRED OF THE ADS. Game concept is good but no one will play this game when there is 1 ad in EVERY LEVEL,tag:(ads)
The game has lots of ads but the worst part was that it popped an ad during the middle of a level.,tag:(ads)
You eventually get to levels that force you to fail to make you watch ads to skip them,tag:(ads)
This app is ads with a little bit of gaming.,tag:(ads)
Pretty cute. The ads are very small and get removed as soon as you begin playing. This is a poopie time game kind of app. LOL,tag:(ads)
It's made by voodoo so little fun all ads thay usewel for the there games,tag:(ads)
Too many ads,tag:(ads)
"Good game, but too many ads has ruined the total gaming experience.",tag:(ads)
"30s ads per round, worst game i have ever saw, thats too much",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
To many ads and doesn't actually allow you to be better or worse based on skill. Complete waste of time,tag:(ads)
"Legit ads are longer than each level and some levels the ""snow/clouds"" cover the end of the level so you can't maximize your score.",tag:(ads)
Wayy too many ads and also the app was not designed for galaxy S10E. The amount of diamonds are right under the camera. Its funny cause the ads are designed for the galaxy.,tag:(ads)
Great game hate the constant ads,tag:(ads)
Too many ads and diamond are uselesss,tag:(ads)
Many ads,tag:(ads)
Kinda fun but pointless you win gems but have nothing to buy with them.. also a lot of ads.,tag:(ads)
Ads ads ads,tag:(ads)
"Lots of ads but we're used to that with the rest of this developer's,concept is nice and similar to other games,but whats the point of collecting the rubies/gems if we cant do anything with them? A great concept ruined",tag:(ads)
Worst game so many ads dosent make sence lose so easy and laggy,tag:(ads)
Simple game with no way to spend rewards. Has ads to get gems you can't use.,tag:(ads)
"Lots of ads, zero enjoyment. If you play the first level you played the whole game. Skip all Voodoo Games",tag:(ads)
Ads are too much,tag:(ads)
too much ads,tag:(ads)
"Too many ads, just like every other game.",tag:(ads)
Ad base game. (A ad base game is where a game is made with in 20 minutes and they load it with ads.) Voodoo is the company who made this game all of their games are ad base. I recommend going and getting happy mod it allows for ads to be removed and for u to play the game with out ads :).,tag:(ads)
You will watch ads more than you play the game. Lose a level after 15 seconds? 30 second ad. Win a level after 30 seconds? 30 second ad.,tag:(ads)
"Terrible. Too many ads. They give you gems in each game but there's nowhere to spend them, they're just pictures.",tag:(ads)
"All the Ads, terrible controls, and underwhelming amount of actual game play to ad ratio. Truly another terrible mobile game.",tag:(ads)
Way to glitchy and the ads are too long for like every action?? Idk just something I would enjoy for very long,tag:(ads)
"The game is so laggy the controls suck, how can you mess up moving a character moving left to right? And too many ads 👎🏼 dont waste time you can't get back!",tag:(ads)
"Controls are too glitchy and the ads are extremely excessive. 30 second ads(unskippable) for every single action? Wish I could rate ""0"" stars.",tag:(ads)
Way too many ads,tag:(ads)
Just another excuse of a game just to watch ads and there is a ad every level or when you die and the controls are way to sensitive,tag:(ads)
Yeah its good. Ads after each level but levels fun. Don't know how people find this game hars,tag:(ads)
"To many ads, fine with airplane mode. Its just a boring repetitive game.",tag:(ads)
Ads after every level suck.,tag:(ads)
I think there's a game in your ads,tag:(ads)
Ads are so long,tag:(ads)
"Another Voodoo game, another insane overabundance of ads. Don't bother.",tag:(ads)
"The controls are so loose that by the 3rd level it has already become too difficult to be considered a casual game, sucking most of the fun out of it. Also there are too many ads and nothing to spend the diamonds on.",tag:(ads)
"Upon seeing the name of the game, I became excited beyond belief. This was short lived when I quickly learned that the game doesn't at all play like the originals, it feels like just another mobile game (microtransactions, boosts, construction queues etc) with the theme of something that used to be popular. Very disappointed, I should have known. If this was more like the original, pay to own and with no ads, no patches in disguise of DLC and no microtransactions, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",tag:(p2w)
"Not bad gameplay... buuuuttttt... it has egregious and aggressive Microtransactions, thus becoming a pay to win, pay to move on, seriously you can wait days for 1 block... ONE. I admit I spent a couple dollars on this, but it just wasn't worth it. If this was a full focused dungeon keeper experience, like the old games, but you can pay like $3 and play without problems and on the go, instead of f2p garbage, I could recommend it",tag:(p2w)
I'D RATE LOWER IF POSSIBLE. please note..I gave this game a solid chance. I would've paid 100 bucks or more for a great part 3 stand alone game. Microtransactions have utterly ruined this once epic franchise. Sad. .. actually.. it's heartbreaking and soul crushing what the focus on microtransactions have done to much of the industry. ... Just read this (years later now) I feel more strongly than ever. I wish I just lost interest.. but I actually feel spite towards EA. Any loyalty I had is gone.,tag:(p2w)
Get the real dungeon keeper on GOG with no microtransactions...,tag:(p2w)
MICROTRANSACTIONS.....MONETIZATION....That's all this game is and EA had GOOGLE take off all NEGATIVE REVIEWS. So I'm just here to remind everyone. Dont waste your time. Just go download jumper. You'll have way more fun anyways,tag:(p2w)
"This app sucks! I am not a hypocrite. The beginning is pretty fun but after a while the gameplay gets boring and the dungeon building... The dungeon building sucks, when you remove tiles it takes forever. And the rooms are overpriced and the microtransactions get crazy. A tile took 24 hours to remove it took 246 gems to remove. I would write more but you get the gyst",tag:(p2w)
"when this first came out the microtransactions made this seem like the devils anus of mobile games, but now that every mobile game manipulates you for your cold hard cash, its not as bad :/ (then again, ive never played the original dungeon keeper, so i might play that and then come back later to hate on this game)",tag:(p2w)
Its an EA product... what do you expect? Of course its going to be pay 2 win and full of microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
As someone from awhile back who played the old Dungeon Keeper Games and after playing more of the game... it is just a cash grab that ruins the series microtransactions so bad that it is unplayable don't get this game... get war for the overworld on pc instead it is closer to the game we know and love,tag:(p2w)
"Too Slow. I want to play a game. Most of this game is not playing a game. Unless you are rich and have stupid money to pay for microtransactions, it is unplayable. Good concept though.",tag:(p2w)
Don't bother installing this it's microtransactions to its worst conclusion,tag:(p2w)
"Wrong game. Clash of Clans clone using Dungeon Keeper universe. Microtransactions or suffer. Also, devs cheated to inflate Google Play rating: give less than 5 stars (in game) and instead of Google Play you will be forwarded to email developer",tag:(p2w)
"It's so heavy handed with the microtransactions just in the first 5 minutes, it's insane.",tag:(p2w)
"I forgot to update my review of this game years ago, so I'm sorry if my 
previous positive feedback mislead people. But i can't possibly support 
this game. EA took a franchise that I loved and filled it with time locks 
and agregious microtransactions that were intentionally designed to suck 
your wallet dry for the sake of turning a profit. I'm not okay with this 
design and I'm not okay with this game.",tag:(p2w)
"Used to like this game until I tried it again and it's nothing but 
microtransactions now. EA turned a decent game into a turd sandwich",tag:(p2w)
"Horrible game. Filled to the brim with microtransactions, and not enjoyable 
at all. Disgusting.",tag:(p2w)
Don't download this please! The game is long so you can cash in for speed! EA is forcing you to buy microtransactions by testing you patience!,tag:(p2w)
"Worst ""remake"" ever produced. Everything fun about the original has been replaced by microtransactions and bs grinding. Not fun at all, none of the charm of the original. Just awful",tag:(p2w)
This actually made it to Game informer as the most outrageous microtransactions...,tag:(p2w)
"Long time fan of DK, this one is built around microtransactions, but is still fun without spending anything.",tag:(p2w)
"Don't waste your time, unless you want to fork over tons of cash this game is all about waiting, I would pay for a game without microtransactions and constantly having to wait unless you pay money, and I wouldn't mind waiting if we were talking minutes and not days. I wish people would stop feeding games like this so they would starve and die. Big fan of the originals btw. Plenty of games on the play store that are way better and you only have to pay once.",tag:(p2w)
Fell far from The Mark with ridiculous microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"The game is enjoyable, but the microtransactions make it a little less so. All the free to play stuff is enough to stay interested and helpful however.",tag:(p2w)
Too many microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"Overall not a bad game. Has the downfall of all such games that are designed around addiction fueled microtransactions... Unless you are paying large amounts of cash to buy their in-game currency to speed things up, it gets slow and boring way too fast. Overall the idea is great, but I would much rather have an android port of the classic Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2. I give it three stars and a solid meh. If I had tons of liquid currency to dump into the game or it were easier to earn gems, it might have been more fun.",tag:(p2w)
"Oldskool DK fan here.. heard all the negativity so I had to see for myself.. got to say I actually like it. Seems like most of the criticisms are of the f2p model & microtransactions rather than the game itself. Which is  a blast! So you have to wait for stuff... yeah welcome to f2p mobile games, get a life or just play a few others so you aren't left staring at the screen waiting or tempted to buy gems. And for a true successor there's War For The Overworld.. if this didn't carry the DK name it would be rated a high 4, really is a good game in its own right.",tag:(p2w)
"Just charge us for the game, guys. I would rather pay up front for a real game instead of getting a ""free"" game that costs me way too much in microtransactions to be enjoyable.",tag:(p2w)
Can't type in my dungeon name also microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
This is so dumb play the originals way better then the microtransactions in this pile of crap.,tag:(p2w)
I can't stand the constant demand for microtransactions. It's to the point of asking oneself why even play. It's too bad to see what EA has done to a classic Bullfrog game..,tag:(p2w)
"Unlike some others here, i dont mind the microtransactions. They arent required, they just make things faster and, also unlike others, i am a patient man.",tag:(p2w)
"I never played the original dungeon keeper, So this is all based on this game. This game is really fun. Besides the microtransactions it somewhat forces you to do, the gameplay itself is great. But today I log in to find out that my dungeon was gone and I had to restart. But I'm not. I'm done with this game. The disconnecting from servers is one thing but restarting, Yeah I'm good.        TL;DR game is fun but long load times and ea crave for money.",tag:(p2w)
"The game is nearly unplayable due to the extreme delays to simple things such as the number of imps you have or the generation of gems etc. EA has taken away the heart and soul of this game and turned it into a gigantic series of  microtransactions. There is no shame in waiting for items to generate or build rooms etc, but when a single tile of gems takes 4 hours to dig out, and your are offered the option of rushing the order for 49 green gems and your return is only 3 to 4 gems, it is very frustrating. Also when raiding other dungeons, even if my minions are not harmed I am still forced to pay 1 to 2 gems to resupply, otherwise if I return to the (my) dungeon I lose my minions and am forced to resummon (ie pay gold) to bring the minions back into my domain.   Sadly I will be uninstalling, and I am very disappointed in the revival of this game.",tag:(p2w)
Only after 4 hours into the game do you realize opening gold mines and quarries creates an irreversible weaknes... also employs very aggressive microtransactions for real money.  Destroys the game.,tag:(p2w)
Drowning in bullshit microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
Lots of microtransactions but the concept and playabillity are there if you can deal with the waiting (hence the microtransactions)it is entertaining.,tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions you say? If paying to win is your thing then have I got a game for you. This could've been really great. The graphics are great and the vibe is dead on, but having to spend money to do anything is wrong in every way.",tag:(p2w)
Not even touching this one. Just played to see how bad it was with the time and microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"This game would be fantastic except for microtransactions.  I would buy this for a one time price in a heartbeat, but I'm not going to sink any kind of recurring funds into it",tag:(p2w)
Free to play? What EA really means is you have to pay to play and pay to win. This game is nothing but a clever way to rob you with its microtransactions. Don't want to buy them? Then good luck doing even the most basic actions in the game. EA is nothing but a money-grubbing disgrace of a company. Totally deserving of the title of Worst Company in America.,tag:(p2w)
The microtransactions actions make this game torture. The original creator has even called this game ridiculous. Boo on you EA for skewing  your Google Play ratings by not logging reviews from customers that give this less than 5 stars from within the game.,tag:(p2w)
"It's such a shame.  If EA had just charged money up front to buy the game, I would probably give it 4-5 stars.  Instead, the microtransactions ruin what could have been a cool game.  If you don't pay, be prepared to wait longer and longer for each dungeon upgrade until you're waiting multiple days for each thing.  Playing 5 minutes at a time with hours or days in between does not make for a fun game.",tag:(p2w)
"Nearly impossible to play without spending hundreds of dollars, the microtransactions make this game atrocious",tag:(p2w)
"That's all this game is, microtransactions. You can't do anything without paying and the prices are outrageous.",tag:(p2w)
Unbalanced gameplay. Game will nickel and die u to death with its microtransactions. Gems are too few and take forever to mine. Minions will not defend your dungeon when getting attacked. This is just a money grab for EA. I would play the original pc game anyday over this version.,tag:(p2w)
"Love the game, hate microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
Addictively fun even without succumbing to the Gems microtransactions.(EA would have your soul as well if they could.).  I see progressive improvement with each update.  Better minion inventory/micromanagement tools would enhance this game greatly.  Fingers are crossed.,tag:(p2w)
This is riddled with ton of microtransactions hindering me playing the game for more than a couple minutes. Why oh why cant I just pay 5 or 10 for it and unlock everything. People who pay these rediculous prices are killing the game industy.,tag:(p2w)
"The game is entertaining, but it's hard at times to ignore the ever present microtransactions that the game doesn't even try to dress up. I don't mind IAPs, but doing it in this game makes you feel like you threw the money out of a moving car.",tag:(p2w)
"Yet another ""game"" where the primary dynamics are Microtransactions and waiting... but it is fun for the 6 minutes a day you get to use your imps.",tag:(p2w)
"Leave it to EA to take a great classic game and turn it into a vapid lumbering husk that screams Feed Me Microtransactions!  Not only did I uninstall the game, I'm also steering clear of owning their stock.  They're doing it wrong.  Very wrong.",tag:(p2w)
"The folks upset with the microtransactions are not playing the game at the intended free to play pacing. It is slow, not intended for extended game play. A few minutes here or there to win.",tag:(p2w)
Most appalling use of IAP cancer I've ever seen. This game is seriously worse than candy crush. You developers building a game from the ground up with microtransactions in mind are killing gaming. As a huge fan of the original dungeon keeper series I was more than disappointed by this garbage. Pass this one up everyone.,tag:(p2w)
"Brings back memories of the old days of pc gaming! It's a bit demanding on your time and the microtransactions are too expensive, but it's a lot of fun for the patient.",tag:(p2w)
"Along with the horrifying microtransactions, it runs poorly and sucks the battery out of your phone at an alarming rate. EA ruins another IP.",tag:(p2w)
Too many microtransactions to do anything,tag:(p2w)
"I had to see for myself if it was as bad as they say, and I can confirm that I spent the past week just watching timers. There is no fun to be had here. Only microtransactions. Or months of patience before seeing gameplay. Shame that this was my first introduction to the dungeon keeper series...the originals seemed ahead of their time. This game is a travesty and a shining example of greed. Stay far away.",tag:(p2w)
"Also, too many microtransactions",tag:(p2w)
"This game has a great idea behind it, but the execution leave much to be desired.  I understand the idea of a free-to-play game having microtransactions, but this takes it to a whole new, dark level.  When it takes hours to perform basic functions, it's no longer a microtransaction, it becomes paygating. For example: Expanding your Dungeon; what genius thought 4 to 24 hours to clear one space was a good idea?  Take out the paygating, and this game becomes infinitely more playable; maybe even a 4-5 star app.",tag:(p2w)
Terrible water downed greedy grab for cash through microtransactions. EA needs to stop ruining everything they touch and just die already. EA greedy corporates execs are ruining games.,tag:(p2w)
This game really should have just cost some money upfront rather than the outrageously expensive microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
Far too many microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
This is a shoddy ripoff of the old school Snes game and everything about it is shady from the microtransactions to the in game rating trying to force you to give it a 5 star review.,tag:(p2w)
"Don't let their review control tactics work.  Review the game from the Play store, NOT FROM WITHIN THE GAME.  This is the exact same game as Battle Dragons and Clash of Clans.  It is also ruined by microtransactions.  You can only play in very short bursts and progress is VERY slow unless you pay an arm and a leg.  This would probably be a lot better than Battle Dragons and Clash of Clans if it weren't for the paywall.",tag:(p2w)
"Even with the microtransactions from hell, I was still enjoying the game, but lately my imps seem frozen in the heart and won't do tasks assigned to them. Sometimes I have to cancel an assignment, which causes me to lose resources and then start it back up again to get them to work. Now 5 of the six are just standing around in the heart. Very annoying. EA seems to not care either about fixing problems, just adjusting things in the game to make it more frustrating to play.",tag:(p2w)
This game exists solely to steal your money.  Its gameplay is designed 100% around microtransactions.  It's a racket and a sham and Electronic Arts should be shut down.  They bring shame to all developers and gamers alike.,tag:(p2w)
Too many microtransactions. Not the game we used to play.,tag:(p2w)
This game used to be really fun on PC. But EA has removed anything fun from it in order to push microtransactions way beyond what is reasonable. If they want more people to play it they need to stop affecting the central gameplay in order to nickel and dime everyone.,tag:(p2w)
Unfortunately with this game is way too many microtransactions to fully enjoy this game ea has done a pitiful job in recreating this Android port,tag:(p2w)
"EA's greedy money scams all over again. They take something you love from childhood and turn it into a CoC remake that falls flat on it's face, then require microtransactions to get -anything- done. 24 hours to mine a single wall? Don't worry, you can spend gems to speed it up! Want more imps? Here, buy our 99$ dollar pack of gems and spend them all in two days then be stuck again! But seriously, EA has thrown a wonderful franchise in the mud.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions make this unplayable,tag:(p2w)
Commonly lose connection in middle of raid which results in loss of resources spent on raid and no rewards given.   Seems like microtransactions are necessary to progress in game at a certain point. No possible way to earn enough gems to progress without paying.   $99 is best value?  Ridiculous.,tag:(p2w)
"I get F2P and microtransactions as a revenue model. The game does evoke bit of the original Dungeon Keeper Franchise, but man does it fall short as soon as you see something will take HOURS unless of your want to spend some of the in game currency to speed things up. It's just horribly unbalanced and really takes out the ability and desire to want to sit down and ""play"" I can log in, do a few tasks but them i'm all done and out of time unless I want to sink money into the game, and even then it means that once i'm out of virtual currency again i'm all done playing. Let me pay 10-20 dollars for a complete game, heck if its a polished and full 30+hours of play I would pay more. Play by timer\calendar though not gonna happen.",tag:(p2w)
"In order to do ANYTHING in this game at a decent rate, you are going to have to pay money. Lots of it. It could be fun, potentially, but the only real point is to build up a dungeon in limited space. So I can see very little to keep me coming back. It isn't complex enough or dynamic enough - EA is just back to their old tricks with microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"The microtransactions and pay to play aspects have completely ruined what I've long considered to be a classic game. If this was new IP, hey, EA can do what they want, but given the lineage of this title, anyone familiar with the original will be disappointed.",tag:(p2w)
EA is using questionable tactics to trick users into leaving 5-star reviews. Also the game is just not fun if you don't pay an absurd amount of money on microtransactions and can only be played with an active internet connection.,tag:(p2w)
"Revised Review. As a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, this version of the game had me excited to try it. Unfortunately all of the freedom and fun of the original has been replaced by time restrictions and microtransactions. 24 hours to mine one square, or you can rush it for about $2.50. Ridiculous! If you are a fan of the original,  skip this version,  or you memories will be tainted.",tag:(p2w)
Would be willing to pay a few bucks up front instead of the microtransactions...if the game were actually worth playing.  There are way better strategy games out there.,tag:(p2w)
"EA now a days is known as the worst company in America..while i believe that to not be true, they are without a doubt the worst ""gaming"" company ever, they keep making shady stuff like this and ruin every great title they get their filthy hands on, this one is now ruined by overly expensive microtransactions and wait time beyond the originals so if you were a long time fan..well EA now screwed you, and they will not let you rate below 5 stars through the app! AVOID.",tag:(p2w)
"I feel odd leaving a 3 star rating for a game I enjoy. Maybe I'm just too fond of the original. The time to accrue resources in this game is staggering. I can understand the need to monetize games, but perhaps have something like a one - time purchased gem doublet lot something for those of us who would like to support a game but not fork over a hundred freaking dollars in microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"The game has a ridiculous set of microtransactions, making it a very expensive  game that is very cheap. You may like it, until you realize you are throwing money at it just for a basic experience. Pass on it.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions.. SO MANY MICROTRANSACTIONS.,tag:(p2w)
I haven't spent a dime and I'm enjoying the temporal diversion of creating a solid defense dungeon.  I don't undetstand why people download free to play apps then complain about microtransactions.  It'd be like downloading Xcom Enemy Unknown and complaing about how you hate turn based strategy games.  The game mechanics for DK on mobile are basically a clone of Clash. I like how the game seems more accessible since the userbase isn't awash with overpowered players so newbies can be competitive.,tag:(p2w)
"First off, the microtransactions in this game are outrageous. Second I had to restart the game 3 times because my phone locks after a certain amount of down time, like all phones, and the game decided it didn't like that very much. Also note there is a ton of downtime in this game. A lot.",tag:(p2w)
Deceptive ratings manipulation and really badly implemented free to play. Can't do anything without microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"When your microtransactions get so bad that they've clearly ruined the fundamental fun of the game play of a classic franchise, it's probably time to stop.",tag:(p2w)
Remembered playing the pc version of this game and enjoying it. My only nitpick is the microtransactions which I avoid just to play. I'll keep playing the pc versions,tag:(p2w)
"In addition to this being the ""gold""-soaked (all-new in-game DK humor preview!) desecration of an IP belonging to one of the first to fall victim to EA's dev hitlist, the game practically holds a gun up to your head in order to get a 5-star review. The reason this has so many glowing ones is because a positive review nets you free gems, and anything less just redirects you to EA's trusted support service, the only way you review as usual is to come back to the Play page. Anyway, that's kinda waaaaaaaaaay against the TOS last time I checked, so, uh, I recommend doing something about it. Another alternative to spending real-word 3D money towards microtransactions is to grab the OG DK/DK2 off of GOG as a form of rebellion, or something, you'll stare in awe as the measurement for mining stone is measured in microseconds instead of days",tag:(p2w)
Abusive microtransactions make this game completely unplayable. Shame on you EA,tag:(p2w)
Screw u microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
We should not allow games that exploit excellent names thrive in this industry. EA has made a mockery of the Dungeon Keeper franchise and I'm not the only one who thinks that. The sheer requirement of microtransactions is sickening.,tag:(p2w)
"Abusive use of microtransactions. It's hardly F2P, but rather PayToPlay. Your time better spent elsewhere.",tag:(p2w)
I would happily pay 2 dollars for this game with out it  any Microtransactions and no annoying waiting but unfortunately they ruin what was at one point a fantastic game,tag:(p2w)
"This game embodies everything that is wrong with microtransactions. It barely qualifies as a game. Stay clear. Instead, try playing a game like Dungelot.",tag:(p2w)
"EA is shooting for more ""Worst Company"" awards with this one. Microtransactions are all but forced upon the player as without them the game plays at an unbearably slow pace (DAYS to accomplish minor tasks). What's more, when asked by the game to rate the app, if you select anything other than 5 stars, you're sent to an EA feedback page rather than the app store review page. There's no doubt that a lot of low-star reviews are missing because of this disgusting deception. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions galore.,tag:(p2w)
This is a soulless cash in on a beloved game that captures none of the magic of the originals. Full of pay to play bullshit microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"I would actually like to play this game if it wasn't all about microtransactions and waiting hours for things to finish. Remove that make, it a normal paid game and it would be a game I'd buy.",tag:(p2w)
EA clearly doesn't care nearly as much about making a playable game as they do about making money in microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
Either this is a blatant way to take advantage of original DK enthusiasm or someone royally screwed up some basic algorithms. Free to play games are generally still fun while progressing is still possible... microtransactions are in place to enrich the experience...  BUT THIS GAME IS OPPOSITE OF THAT. without some very expensive microtransactions it's nearly impossible  to advance. Even digging out your own dungeon is ridiculously slow...  Unless you want to pay of course.,tag:(p2w)
I would have loved to have paid 5$ for a great game instead of getting a game loaded with microtransactions I will never pay for. EA I joke you're happy from today on I will never download a game from you if it has microtransactions in it.,tag:(p2w)
A poor use of the IP that is riddled with microtransactions that slow the game down artificially and frustrate the player.,tag:(p2w)
Too many microtransactions to adequately enjoy the game.,tag:(p2w)
You can only play this game with the microtransactions and they are ludicrously pricey,tag:(p2w)
"This game brought back fine memories of playing the original game from the nineties. Unfortunately, microtransactions are necessary to get anything done practically. Actions that used to take seconds in thr old game instead take hours, unless you pay with gems bought with real money. This game broke my heart.",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions are rarely good, but at least the ones in Clash of Clans are low cost, this is just a bad, more expensive clone. Doesn't help that EA is blocking undesirable ratings to inflate the score",tag:(p2w)
Bombarded with microtransactions. Everything in the game quickly progresses to taking hours to complete tasks ... gets very boring very quick when you can't do anything until your upgrades complete and they take 4+ hours.,tag:(p2w)
"If you really want to try this game, do yourself a favor and buy 25$ in ""gems"" to unlock extra workers from the beginning. Earning them in game is weeks of grinding.  95% of this is a very slow base-building game, shamelessly powered by microtransactions. The attack and defense sections are better, but you are still at the mercy of players willing to pay more to win. Worst of all, the pay to play model only gets more expensive as you level up.",tag:(p2w)
"Supposed to be a spiritual successor, but what it is really is taking an old game they knew people would want to play, add microtransactions, and use it as a cash grab. I hope nobody buys into this.",tag:(p2w)
"The microtransactions turns a wonderful remake of a classic, into a horrible pile of steaming crap.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions suck. Down with EA!,tag:(p2w)
This isn't even a game. It's just a means for EA to take your money while they try the worst implementation of microtransactions I have ever witnessed in a video game. I'm done with giving this company my time and my money,tag:(p2w)
The microtransactions are ridiculous,tag:(p2w)
It's just a clone of your typical mobile free to play city builder with a ton of microtransactions thrown in.   There's nothing here to keep you coming back,tag:(p2w)
"This game is nothing more than microtransactions and pay walls. Don't waste your time downloading it, let alone 'playing' it. Unless you enjoy paying money to speed up a count down timer.   Shame on you EA.",tag:(p2w)
Way to many microtransactions. Tutorial is wayyyy too long. Time limits everywhere.,tag:(p2w)
"Designed to wring microtransactions out of as many people as possible, not designed to be a fun game. Don't waste your time.",tag:(p2w)
Too many overpriced microtransactions. I'd rather pay a flat fee for the game and enjoy the game rather than constantly having to pay.,tag:(p2w)
The microtransactions are ridiculous. You could either wait 24 hours for a single tile to be cleared or spend a couple of dollars to get it cleared instantly. This inhibits gameplay horribly. It'd be much worthier of your time to simply find a game that you pay five bucks for once rather than a hundred dollars for over the course of a few weeks.,tag:(p2w)
"While it is certainly a graphical upgrade of the original, the microtransactions are pushed so heavily that this game is entirely unplayable without forking over way too much cash. Honestly, this game is sad.",tag:(p2w)
Not pay to play or free to play. You pretty much are playing just to give them money. Great game turned into garbage by microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"This game is the worst of gaming, creating $100 microtransactions. This is not ok.",tag:(p2w)
"If you've played the DK series for PC at all, avoid this like the plague. Horrible excuse for DK series game, but I should've seen it coming with the EA branding. I took a chance despite reviews and to my disappointment,  they were accurate. This game screams microtransactions.  STEER CLEAR!",tag:(p2w)
I can't support this game has to many microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"I expected some microtransactions,  but really EA, REALLY? If you want to have 'fun' on this app have fun spending $100 at least. I played the original DK 1&2 and they are way better, and DK 2 only costs $5 for 10000% improvement on gameplay. If you rate this more than one star you are an idiot who supports filthy microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
A soulless remake of a great game littered with microtransactions and insane wait times. Almost unplayable.  Fans of the original should avoid.,tag:(p2w)
"It's a f2p game, so there are microtransactions. But demanding that I pay money in order to finish digging out a single block of dirt inside of 24 hours is just ridiculous.  On top of that is the ""Slap your imps to double their speed for 30 minutes"". This is designed to bring a player back every half hour and eventually wear the person down to spend real money to just finish a single order.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions destroy this game 's playability.,tag:(p2w)
4 hours to break a rock? 24 hours to break a rock?  Microtransactions fuel the game so that you aren't waiting a week to build out a 3x3 square. Stay far away.,tag:(p2w)
"While I wanted to like this game I just can't.  You can't get beyond level 3 without paying.  Now, I understand this is a freemuim game, but pay to win is different than pay to play.  I would rather pay $5 than have the required microtransactions.  The gameplay is good, just as it was in the 1997 game this was ported from, but the restrictive model is just a deal breaker.  Sorry DK.",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions abound in this otherwise entertaining game.  I'd gladly buy it for a flat $10, but I'll never pay a dime for this.",tag:(p2w)
"Wow this game would be so amazing without all the microtransactions.  But no, this is a streaming pile of greed from EA.  I feel sorry for you folks that actually pay for gems.  Uninstalled.",tag:(p2w)
Game ruined by microtransactions.... Shame on u ea,tag:(p2w)
"Loved the old one, and this one is nice so far. I haven't felt pressured to buy anything yet, so I don't get why people are so negative about the microtransactions, but it would've been nice just to have a full game at a flat price.",tag:(p2w)
"This game is pretty good, or at least it has the potential to be. However, the microtransactions, and the game mechanics related to them (long building/mining time) kill a lot of the fun.",tag:(p2w)
"Waaay too many microtransactions.  I'd be more than happy to pay one lump sum for a game with no time limits, and normal xp progression. I'm really disappointed in EA right now. They ruined one of my favorite games ever. The graphics, while not what I was expecting, based on the original, were okay. -sighs- And I was so excited too.",tag:(p2w)
"""Hurry up and wait"" is the real name of this game.  Ridiculous amounts of microtransactions or tons of waiting around ruin what was once a great title.",tag:(p2w)
They have taken an originally fantastic game and ruined it with microtransactions. Id rather pay $9.99 for the REAL game and not this BS.,tag:(p2w)
"As the title says, it's free to pay, not free to play. Would rather pay a one time fee than pay for microtransactions. And don't say this is like arcade games. At least back then if you were skilled enough you could get through a game with a single quarter.",tag:(p2w)
"MICROTRANSACTIONS. seriously, to make any progress, be prepared to spend ALOT of cash for this so-called ""free"" game",tag:(p2w)
"EA have taken another great franchise of yesteryear and completely corrupted it for the sake of a parasitic business model. I don't have a problem with f2p per se, but as with plants vs zombies, EA have made this game essentially unplayable without forking out for repeated microtransactions.",tag:(p2w)
"Not only is it a disapointment when I was hoping for a mobile original dungeon keeper, but it also is filled up to the tip of collapse with microtransactions, and even thought I like the ""2x build speed"", it does not make up for the grummy, money wanting theifs that is EA. I would rather pay $10 on Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 than pay $10 for 1200 gems.Thanks for ruining Dungeon Keeper. If you think this is a good idea to download this ""game"", then go download Clash Of Clans. It's better than this atrocity",tag:(p2w)
The gameplay is fun and reminds me of the original to an extent. The microtransactions are way overboard though. Save all gems you get to buy imps because imps are just way overpriced and are too integral to the game itself. And as with many free to play games - pay to win is the order of the day. You will have trouble getting into the top 10 unless you are willing to shell out tons of cash.  As a casual game this isn't too bad. Just don't go in expecting Dungeon Keeper.,tag:(p2w)
"This game has, bar none, the worst microtransactions I have ever seen.  It is a horribly dumbed down version of DK which keeps reminding you that you could do everything the same speed you can in the original (cheap to buy on GOG these days) if you keep paying. It would only take about a day to spend more in this game than it would cost to buy a new PC and the original, far better game.  Avoid at all costs.",tag:(p2w)
This is a completely awful port of a once great game. Whoever had the idea of changing the dynamic of the game and adding microtransactions is a complete idiot. I was very excited about this game because I used to play it all the time. Upon downloading it and realizing that EA has destroyed yet another once great franchise with its ridiculous business practices a small part of me and my childhood died. Sincerely disappointed!,tag:(p2w)
The game is incredibly dull unless you are willing to pay out big $$ in microtransactions.  Buy the original for your PC if you want to play dungeon keeper.  It is much cheaper and a far better game.,tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions bring the game to a dead stop, and make the game unplayable unless you are willing to shell out a fortune to continue. It's such a shame too, the underlying gameplay showed signs of being great fun before it was ruined with pay-to-win garbage.",tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions ruined this game. Don't spend a cent on this nonsense.,tag:(p2w)
It's exactly what I expected from EA. DK with microtransactions. If you've played Castle Clash then you're familiar with the concept. So as far as these kinds of games go the cost and wait times are pretty bad. You'll wait a long time for anything to complete and there's no easy/quick way to get the uber currency via special offers (though special events allow you to win a few every now and again. I think for what you get there are better and more generous games than this.,tag:(p2w)
"Do you like waiting 24 hours for your imps to dig out a 1X1 square?  Do you like playing a short battle/defense sequence where you are mostly a spectator?  Do you like spending gobs of money on microtransactions?  Then this game is for you!  This game is the epitome of what is wrong with ""free to play"" gaming.  Don't waist your time with this...go buy the original on Good Old Games for a few bucks.",tag:(p2w)
"This game is a horror. Microtransactions are the only way to progress, unless you want to wait a infuriating amount of time. Ruined the feel of the series altogether.",tag:(p2w)
EA sucks. Yay microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"This game comes from one of the greatest old PC games to ever exist. Unfortunately, EA picked up the game and made it unplayable without the microtransactions. The tutorial literally tells you that you have to spend money to get things done. Trying to do things without feeding EA money is impossible. The game is fun, but it's agonizingly slow, so it's absolutely unplayable.",tag:(p2w)
"Microtransactions run this game into the ground. It is not only an insult to the consumer, but a pure example of how little EA actually cares about the people who buy their games. The absurd microtransactions associated with this game are an embarrassment to the industry. EA should be ashamed.",tag:(p2w)
It takes an entire day to dig out one tiny block of land? Microtransactions are beyond reason.,tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions ruined it,tag:(p2w)
"I have been waiting for a game like this! I don't have time to play games lately, and with this game, I don't need time. I can pay real money and win without playing! I wish all games had this option! When I am not winning I just pay more money than my opponent, and I win! I would much rather pay real money repeatedly than play a game and possibly lose. Why play when you can pay? I couldn't win games without microtransactions. They are the answer to every lazy gamer's prayers! Welcome to the future!",tag:(p2w)
The entire game is microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"I played the first dungeon keeper game when I was a kid. It was great and I love the franchise. This game could have been great but microtransactions completely killed any chance of that happening. Lets make this clear if you haven't played the original (which you can find online for ~5$), it should take you about 2 minutes to dig out a huge room. Not the 2+ hours EA is trying to sell you. Make the game the way it was meant to be and I would happily pay 10$ for it, but not like this, not ever.",tag:(p2w)
The microtransactions are terrible and the grind is the worst I've ever seen in a microtransaction based game,tag:(p2w)
I loved the original Dungeon Keepers and I was stoked to see this in the play store! I downloaded and played it only to realized that it was horribly ruined by the mobile freemium model. That's EA for ya. I would have paid up to $10 if this was based on microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
Microtransactions galore. Do not get this game.,tag:(p2w)
Great concept for a game  ruined by ea's need to alter games to force microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
I hate microtransactions..,tag:(p2w)
Except all of the microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
Some many microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"Possibly ""smart"" move of EA to force people into paying for the gems.  Nut sure.  But without the microtransactions (which are not really micro,  but quite contrary quite expensive) you will wait one day to remove one square of stone.  Started to be bored after 6 hours.  I want a game that is fun to play as the original DK used to be! Uninstalling...",tag:(p2w)
"The type of people who design a game that locks you out of playing unless you pay, have a special level of hell carved out just for them. Microtransactions are fine, but should only be used to enhance the game play, not be an integral part that ALLOWS you to play a game. Dont bother with this BS. DON'T give these crooks your money to keep funding this type of robbery.",tag:(p2w)
A potentially fun game absolutely ruined by expensive microtransactions.,tag:(p2w)
"This game requires a lot of microtransactions to play, and it really has no reason to be called Dungeon Keeper. Avoid avoid avoid.",tag:(p2w)
f****** microtransactions,tag:(p2w)
"Controls are glitchy, takes a long time to load. Game play is slowed to a crawl mostly waiting for resources to load in order to convince you to buy gems. Storyline asks you to buy gems constantly. Unless you'd like to spend enough money to buy a dozen other games on microtransactions, don't bother downloading.",tag:(p2w)
Just make us pay for a good gane instead of designing a crappy game purely based on microtransactions... ea sucks so bad,tag:(p2w)
"A good mobile gaming interpretation of one of my favourite series, but the microtransactions kill the mood.",tag:(p2w)
"I played the pc games to death growing up and to see this game available as a phone app is really awesome. And I like that all microtransactions are there for ease, not for winning. More games like this please... And make DK3 for pc!",tag:(p2w)
