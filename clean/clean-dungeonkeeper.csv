"It's a 220% Pay to Play Ripoff of a once popular P.C. games, DO NOT waste your time!!!!",1
Its...great,5
I was having alot of fun with this game until I pressed a button that said share and now the game won't load anymore. I try to launch it and it immediately crashes. I'm sad now. I really liked this game... Ok figured out how to get it to load again. Uninstall the game and reinstall it.,4
Not ready for a review but I do have a question. Is there a way to restart your dungeon? I made many unfixable mistakes and I was hoping I could begin a new dungeon. Thank you!!!!,3
"Awful design. You have to intentionally lose 90% of your games otherwise youre forced into matches you have zero chances of winning. Terrible mechanics. Poor programming, cant function on less than 1gig fibre optic internet speed otherwise you get loading errors and constant refreshes",2
"Upon seeing the name of the game, I became excited beyond belief. This was short lived when I quickly learned that the game doesn't at all play like the originals, it feels like just another mobile game (microtransactions, boosts, construction queues etc) with the theme of something that used to be popular. Very disappointed, I should have known. If this was more like the original, pay to own and with no ads, no patches in disguise of DLC and no microtransactions, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",1
Great game,5
"As the game is EA, you can buy more stars with in-app purchase (only $4.99 per star!)",1
Love,5
I love this game üòç,5
"Scratched the nostalgia itch for about a week, and then faded. Can't stand the micro transactions and time/energy based play. Port the originals to mobile please!",1
"Fun game, good for a Folks",5
I really love this game its fun challenging and a great way to kill time this is a very fun game,4
"You can't delete a room! Right now you can't click on imps, it crashes!",3
Its fun. More involved than others,5
"Support is non existent. I am level 64 being put against level 500s in what way is that fair. I spent money on this app only to be bent over. Support will not reply. If you download this app be ready to be frustrated. Another thing, you'll constantly get ""error server7"" which force closes the game.",1
Great castle defense style game must play!,5
"Absolutely love this game, you need to reboot it, at least let us transfer our dungeons over. But seriously this game needs to continue living. This is the best ever. I do have a problem with how the game crashes whenever I finish a raid or something, but other than that I find the game to be absolutely f****** awesome.",4
Like clash of clans but better and clans that actually work with you to help you improve and twerk yer skills,4
"Really enjoying the game play. I remember spending days on end playing the original so, this really makes me happy. Just be careful while building. It is far to easy to set minions digging the walls you want to keep.",4
Sooper fun to play have no problems,5
It's okay but not what I was thinking it would be. I loved playing the original game and I still have the original game on disc. It's close and some what as fun to play but not as fun as the original.,3
Live it man.,4
Fun so far...,5
"Love the original game. Was super excited to see the mobile game version. Cash features and build time could be adjusted. Im having issues clicking on buttons, somehow I have to press a bit left to anything I want to select. Can't wait for developers to fix quirks.",3
Can't play because it won't load.,1
Always a favorite of mine slapping the imps around is fun,5
Super fun! Great humor and a cool spin on tower defense base building games!,5
Garbage.,1
"Such a shame that EA took an excellent property like dungeon keeper and turned it into another pay to win, microtransaction filed mobile game. Taking Dungeon Keeper II and adapting it to mobile controls would have been perfect, instead we get this. Save your time.",1
"The game crashes after the first dungeon defense in the tutorial, and you have to start over. It reduces the game to laying a single spike trap as the total gameplay. Disappointing experience, as a fan of the original pc games.",1
It likes to reset my dungeon. Finally got it back it was away from the U.S. for so long finally got my dungeon back just forgot how to play.,5
"Another great game franchise, gutted and neutered to try to squeeze every possible dollar out of the user. Good job, EA! Once again, they buy a beloved license from a company that's actually competent, and piledrive it straight into the ground. Pathetic bone-picking buzzards. Get out of the industry, you useless, avaricious ghouls.",1
Great game when it works. Please fix your game so I can make it mine.,5
"Great so far, reminds me of the old PC version of this game that I just loved as a kid.",5
I'm just writing this so the 0op up goes away anyways fun game,5
Decent.,4
Killed a classic,1
Love this game and love the entire series. Played them growing up and glad to have a mobile version everywhere I go. A sandbox style mode would be nice.,5
No sirve,1
Absolutely love it!üëç,5
My game will not open now. Such a waist of time and now I can't even get in the game very disappointed,1
"Slow, pay to play game. I'd have paid a one time $5 for a mobile version of the original, but not this micro transaction hell.",2
too many connection errors or telling me connection failed but awesome game otherwise,4
Fun TD,5
"Horrible game. Now you can have monsters that can just float from the portal to you're dungeon heart, what?¬ø, What is the point then if you can avoid all cannons and traps, and then go right for the heart of you're dungeon, you ruined this game devs!",1
"I'm a fan of the original PC games, and this is more insulting than anything. They could've remastered the originals, they could've updated the graphics. This app is proof. But of course they had to go for the lazy micro transaction cash grab. Free progress is slow and you've constantly got other players attacking you, setting back what little progress you've made. Ignore this app and just wait for Evil Genius 2.",1
The only real problem is that imps are way too expensive. Since imps are your only means of getting things done this means either spending 40 bucks on them or lots of waiting. Discount the imps and I'd be very happy.,4
Nicely done,5
"Poor adaptation of a classic. At the very least should've been given a PC version. Horribly long wait times that kill the gameplay, and total lack of balancing between players. Nothing but a cash grab. Do NOT waste money on this!",1
"Love it, just as much as the original. Customised for mobile play. Thx for developing it.",5
Game is totally unbalanced in favour of the attacker.,1
Great for nostalgia. Fun good graphics a little tedious at times worth my time,5
Its been a long time since I had played this game on pc. Its just as phone on a mobile phone.,5
"It's a base building game where you can can play for free if you're willing to wait days for buildings to finish or you can rush the building with gems. It's that simple. I don't mind waiting, I use the time to save up for the next upgrades. The gameplay loop is pretty fun. Just got my 4th imp builder after two or three weeks. That's what you should save your gems for. Help, I can't log into the game now for some reason I tried restarting my phone but for some reason it's not working.",1
Fun in dark places.,5
Wow EA really did ruin my favorite series. I love Richard Riding outright telling me to waste my money on the game. Very charming,1
I love this game years ago on the pc.. I cant believe i found it for mobile... I love it,5
Yayyyy yayy,5
This is a great game similar to the one that I used to play back in 2000 somewhere in that time frame,5
Nothig new for years.,1
Used to play when I was younger has a lot of similarities as the original 1999 version but this would do just to get my gaming on,5
I love this game so much :D thanks ea for this great game,5
"Hey team, why the server is down. Cannot connect for a second day. So far it's great. Did love the PC version long long time ago. Will see how it will go.",5
Cool,4
Nostalgia,5
Doesn't work,1
"I like the game, but its been over a year since we had an update and there are lots of bugs to fix. Sadly, it seems no one wants to bring it up to speed.",4
"6 years later and this is still a predatory, manipulative pile of cynical trash that completely neuters EVERYTHING that made the original games beloved classics. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY! Screw you, EA.",1
"Not bad gameplay... buuuuttttt... it has egregious and aggressive Microtransactions, thus becoming a pay to win, pay to move on, seriously you can wait days for 1 block... ONE. I admit I spent a couple dollars on this, but it just wasn't worth it. If this was a full focused dungeon keeper experience, like the old games, but you can pay like $3 and play without problems and on the go, instead of f2p garbage, I could recommend it",1
"Every time I try to load the game up to play, the screen options glitch & it freezes up. Please fix this A-SAP.",1
Fun game. The wait sucks between upgrades,5
Has alot of bugs freezes on training if you upgrade while trading is comencing im curretly having a bug where i cannot slap my minion for the effiency boost the game say cannot connect to server resets deleted and redownloaded the game still happening reset my phone and all its fun for the most part but the bugs are annoying to co ti ue further in the game,1
Clash of Clans clone that destroys a great original IP for a cash grab.,1
Nastagic. Pun-y. Nice,5
Its okay,4
Great game better then Clash of Clans due to the less stuff and it's fun forcing goblin slaves to do stuff.,5
Way to ruin one of the most fun and innovative games of it time. It's a Half A@$ pay to play clash of clans. I hope you realized you destroyed something beautiful!,1
So far pretty good game.,4
FANTASTIC GAME,5
Absolutely love it! I played the original PC game when I was a kid. I had high hopes for this and was not disappointed.,5
"Sad reboot. Miss Bullfrog. Scrit on the Pay to play, over priced for what you get. Going back to My 90s CD versions.",2
One of my favorite PC games available on my phone.,5
Great,5
But PvP is fun,2
"I was able to earn a 3rd builder on the second day of playing. This game has no ads, and is *actually* possible to play for free. I spent 5 bucks on it because it's a good game - not because I felt pressured to. Really good, especially from E.A. It's not the original dungeon keeper, but for what it is, it's very good.",5
Wickedly wonderfully fun!,5
Great game. Fun and moves quick,5
"Explain how ""air units"" make any damn sense in a dungeon. Let alone the fact this is clearly a clash ripoff. Yall basically just gave it a new skin. This is terrible. I hope every developer and executive gets fired and fills bags at Walmart for the rest of their lives. #uninstall #asap",1
so far so good!!! update!!! i love the game. Awesome!!!!.........!!!,4
"Game is beta quality and they have not bothered to fix even the most basic bugs or make things consistent. Last update was over a year ago. but they will change the promotions every week to get you to use up and need more resources. Expensive if you want to keep playing without resting between attacks. Basically another money hungry game that developers don't care enough about the actual game, only the money. very dissappointed. wish they had come out with DK 3 instead of this watered down app.",2
Great job,5
Love this game ..just like the older one,5
Best game,5
Awsome game,5
"My game keeps crashing, please help, I would have 5 starred you but this isn't cool. Help me please.",1
"I put $40 into starting this game, then played this game for months, once you get decently far into the game it gets super laggy when you summon monsters and there is a glitch that will not allow to smack your imps while doing door construction. The trophy system is the only thing judging who you get paired up to fight against. It is super lazy and easy to break.",1
I like the app but I had the original DK1 and. Dk2. This app is app is much more confusing than either of those. I do realize the times are different but the added functionality has taken much of the fun out of the game.,4
"Dungeon Keeper mobile is delightfully familiar and genuine to the past series titles while integrating progressive base crafting and experience leveling. Many classic minions and builds live on, with hybrid tower defense strategy involved. A passive multiplayer pvp defender as well, DK mobile is a successful addition to the previous Dungeon Keeper battle simulation versions.",5
"I loved this game on pc, the few times i have played this new version i have enjoyed it. I would rate it 5 stars except that the game will not connect to the server very often, leaving me unable to play. I made it through the tutorial which was fun but it crashed after.",3
"By Lucifer's beard, EA! What were you thinking?",2
Seems to be a nice way to spend a hr of time a day,5
Doesn't even load,1
"I was really excited to see a dungeon keeper mobile game, but am fairly disappointed. I love the PC games. This game is missing a lot of that magic. Unfortunately, this game is plagued with many of the downfalls of typical mobile games. It moves very slow, and requires you to constantly come back after an hour or two. I get on, click a couple buttons, and then get off. There's not enough engagement with the actual game for me to even remember that I have it.",3
"Overall, really nice games, although i think its a bit unfair that your dugeon gets attacked and your offline and prepared so you fail and have no notice this happend.",5
Very unfair from beginning. Been playing for 2 days and was already raided multiple times by extremely high level players. I've uninstalled the game and don't recommend it to anyone.,1
Garbage cash grab on a good game there's other games out there that capture the feel of the dungeon keeper games. Like war for the overworld.,1
"I REALLY liked the original games put out by BullFrog (R.I.P.).Have tried to get into this reworking of the fun game, it has elements that are still ok.But it really detracts from the fun when trying to find friends via Google, breaks the app. I'm going on my third time to uninstall and reinstall, and will avoid adding friends until a stable bug fix is deployed. Now it will no longer open. Tried contacting the developers, but was pointed to the community forums at EA which did not have DKforum.",1
Update or you can't compete. Its not a fair game at this point.,1
"This is still a good game. It's not the real dungeon keeper. But for mobile it's pretty good. C.o.c. lite done right.! It does take 24 hours to get a gem block, But who plays a mobile game for a day straight? Reading so many dungeons I've seen some pretty good defenses. It's not as in-depth as the real dungeon keeper but it is a good diversion.",5
Buggy sometimes,3
Smooth gameplay! Love it!,5
Cool,5
Love this game been playing for years.,5
"This is a poor CoC remake based on a once great game franchise, the game is buggy ass all hell, it has the stereo typical EA in game ""dlc"" packs and if I could rate lower I would. Tried giving it a whole hearted change hoping for the game I grew up with. I got retextured clash of clans and stolen voice files.",1
Best game ever so addictive!!!,5
Where is my dungeon gone üò≠üò≠üò≠ I had everything maxxed out and now it's all gone when I went to show my friend this game I thought was really cool but üò≠,1
You made me sit there for a full minute.....every time i went to do anything. *deleted*,1
"When the game forces you into a loading screen that says. Pls wait while imps get your dungeon ready. But you were in the middle of attacking some one else, and not loading into ur dungeon.",1
Excellent,5
Boring not a DK game at all,1
Love this game,5
"Much like the classic, brings back great game play.....",5
Reminds me of d&d when i was a kid,5
"There are many dead guilds, meaning inactive teams. It can be hard to find a good open one. In addition you cannot see any stats on keepers(such as their inactivity timer) until you join them, you can only apply to one at a time.the guild system is kinda broken, please make it easier to find active guilds.",4
Money grab,1
Very interesting game to play,5
i used to play the old dungeon keepers as a kid! when i found out there was a mobile version i about fainted lol. i do wish there was a function in it tho that acted alittle more like the older styles. maybe a skirmish dungeon feature?,5
Game was fun to play but unless you are willing to spend money on gems you have to wait froever for things to upgrade or to just build them,2
good gome,5
"not as good as dungeon keeper, still better than the clones, just wish the mmo would release in america",4
So challenging,5
Was fun while it worked..the whole thing crashed doesnt work anymore. Time and money lost and wated,1
Creative and easy to enjoy. Kills my time pain free.,5
Love it,5
"Really enjoyed the game, but after a recent update, i cant even get the app to open. Would have rated 1 star if i had dropped any real money on it",2
"Not as good as the original, but decent game",4
"Used to love the game, but as others have commented you hit a ceiling without buying at excessive cost enough gems to buy gold and/or stone to upgrade your dungeon beyond what is possible with the built in mines. Game is heavily weighted in favor of the attacker once he upgrades his spells...bomb wall and trap and room disable in particular. Contrary to what the game recommends, it is safer to leave your gold and stone in the mines until you can use it. Traps are costly to repair after raided",3
Pay to play,1
"Not a bad game. Although it isn't right that your being attacked by dungeons 1000s of levels above yours, and cleaning your coffers out. Can never get ahead without spending real money to by gold and stone. Make it more fair, level 17000 shouldn't be attacking level 3000 players. I'm willing to bet many players would pay for a 1 time purchase, but this constant having to buy to get ahead kills anything this game once had.",2
Attacked too often. Not fun.,3
I know you really want a dungeon game where you make your dungeon but this is not the game The greed attached to this game is beyond ridiculous,1
"A really good game. With patience, no money required.",5
Ea needs to stop,1
"I use to play a similar game on Facebook, glad I found this for my tablet",5
Waste of time,1
I'D RATE LOWER IF POSSIBLE. please note..I gave this game a solid chance. I would've paid 100 bucks or more for a great part 3 stand alone game. Microtransactions have utterly ruined this once epic franchise. Sad. .. actually.. it's heartbreaking and soul crushing what the focus on microtransactions have done to much of the industry. ... Just read this (years later now) I feel more strongly than ever. I wish I just lost interest.. but I actually feel spite towards EA. Any loyalty I had is gone.,1
"I once loved this game but at some point you hit a glass ceiling that you'll never get through without paying cash. I get raided 3 times/day and it costs 500k to reset my traps. I top out at 800k and it takes more than a day to even earn that amount. I can't leave any money in the bank or it gets stolen when I get raided, so I can't save up to upgrade any of my rooms which are all over 800k now and I can't win any more of the campaign battles. Deleting. I refuse to P2W.",1
Every game as the pay to continue to have fun wall. The game is fun till you reach that moment,3
"Zero notifications until I open it, and then I get all of them at once, and then the game immediately clears them all.",2
Loved it.. very slow progress but great blast from the past conversion,5
It's fun at first lots of options for upgrading but you hit a brick wall soon as you mine out all the squairs no portal to a new mineing area nothing. The best part of the old game was mineing with your imps n you werent limited to just a few always hunting for the unlimited gold and hopeing you didant bust into another dungon ... I mined the whole thing and have pretty much lost intrist as it's just pointless upgrading from here on out ....hopefully they will fix this and make it fun again...,3
It was horrible played for 2 weeks the pay to play players are gods flying units and wizard attack over walls. But wht do you expect its a EA,1
"Delightful reminder of the old games, except I'm not interested in PvP. Might be back when PvE provides the needed bonuses.",3
I love this game. Had the original CP game. The biggest problem is game freezes and won't load. I have to uninstall then reinstall. So far have had to do three times. Getting annoying üò°üò°üò°üò°,3
"Cash grab, p2w, pay to not wait weeks to break a wall. EA's worst money grab that has ruined another good franchise.",1
We all need to pay cash to move forward in real time if not play at a slow slow grind to move on,1
Oldie but a goodie,4
Compared to the original PC game this one stinks. They took what was an intuitive easy to play game and turned it into an overly complicated mess. Too bad so many will never get to play the game the way it was meant to be played.,1
A fun take on the original PC game.,5
"Fun, casual...sorta...and takes forever to dig and upgrade.",2
Love it upgrade times are a little long but its good,4
Awesome,5
"Dead game, if you're new or haven't played in a long time you're screwed, basically you're gonna be attacking and be attacked by OP players who can just fly straight to your ‚ù§Ô∏è and win, or can kill your 40 minions with 3-4 traps. After the 2nd upgrade the wait time goes from 2 hours to 12, in some cases it immediately goes from a couple of hours to a day wait, making the game pay to advance, even simple things like repairing 5 traps is insanely expensive, you have to pay over 50000 gold.",2
"Good game, when it is working .... unfortunately latest update killed it :(",1
Fun,5
It's a shame that this game does not get more attention. It's really amazing and fun with a lot of humor. Download it so that we can all play!,5
Disappointed... you turned an old pc classic into a microtransaction based slog...,1
Good. Fun does not force you in a position to spend money,4
Meh avarge clash of clans rip off,3
EA ruins everything it touches,1
Too bad this isn't the original.,2
Overall it's a poor imitation of a better game. Strictly a pay-to-play cash grab. Not particularly user friendly and glitchy like you wouldn't believe. EA really should just invest in rebooting the series as a whole.,1
"Hands Down , my Opinion , one the Best App Games Ever Created. All Time Fav of My Son and I. Playing Since the Original on PC. Jr.",5
Love old school classics,5
This is the glitchiest game I've ever played! I can't even finish a raid on a dungeon without the game throwing me back to my own dungeon a few seconds in and taking points from me because I didn't have a chance to finish. I can't upgrade anything in my dungeon because people on level 400 keep attacking my level 70 dungeon and stealing all my gold and stone. I can't even play this game! I have never had to give such a bad review for any app I've downloaded.,1
Great easy to play,5
It's good and that only,4
"Constantly restarts, can't get past the intro. On galaxy z flip.",3
"Really fun, just like old game with new things. Just no good heroes to kill, instead you fight off other players",5
"It's not too much like the original, but I like it. It still has that dark humor and the dungeon like feel to it. It can't beat the original (obviously), but for a phone version, it is pretty decent. Nice job.",3
"I thought I was jumping in to a remake of the classic game. It's another clash of clans. I also don't get how wizards can attack over the walls when they're in under ground tunnels. Graphics are good, game narrator is hilarious, but you'll never beat those who are paying to play if you try to play free.",2
A fun and addictive game,5
Fun cartoony strategy game with humor. The problem with this game is that it requires High internet speed for constant connectivity. I have a 18 megabit per second download and 2.5 megabit per second upload and if I hesitate or pop out of a screen or try to come back it will disconnect me. No other game I play has this kind of issue.,4
"Thank you. It's a very fun and fair game. Even without spending money it is very playable. I like that it I have the ability to change my dungeon how I like and that I don't have to conform to certain set templates. Overall, it's a pretty good game. Enjoy!",5
Slow tedious tutorial set the tone for the game,1
"EA F*** you, are you not satisfied with f***ing over people on pc, xbox, and Playstation? you've already lost about 5% of you're stock if not more due to pay walls on console games, we don't need nor want you f***ing up good classics like these! SO F*** OFF AND GET YOUR S*** TOGETHER!!",1
"Was just kicked from the game for telling the truth about it; that it is dominated by players who a) pay-to-win, b) have been playing it FOREEEEVER, or c) use the cheats (yes, there are cheats out there) to give themselves unlimited gold or stone. Definitely not a game for new players. I am giving up on this game altogether. A microtransaction nightmare.",1
"Its a good game, if i remember correctly. Not sure anymore, as it crashes trying to download ten updates at once right after you download the game.",1
"Almost like the old school dungeon keeper, video game still fun .",4
Dungeon keeper in name only,1
Good game,5
Would be good if it wasn't another money sink...,1
Looking for a game like this for a long time.,5
Great time consuming game.,4
One it is lagy two it is a knockoff of the dungeon series made by kalypso but it is some what enjoyable,3
"Uninstalled it after the terrible tutorial. This is a horrible cash grab and a bad version of the classic we all loved. It's plagued with play walls and gems, yuck! EA screwed another game and more gamers. What's new? And why is there a cookie agreement and terms of service after the tutorial? Just hit no and delete the game. 0/5 stars. Go play the original on PC.",1
i can't play the game beyond the tutorial,1
We want a remake the old pc game !!,2
"Not bad, but the version for the computer is better.",3
App no longer opens.. also paid to win... what a joke. DK by bullfrog was such an amazing game... way to ruin a classic.,1
"Loved it at first, but it lags and crashes so much it's hard to play sometimes and leaves me frustrated. I still like the game but it needs work with universal compatibility. I have a Samsung J7.",3
okay it's basically a tower attack and defense game that was built on the dungeon keeper games back from like 96 98 and I guess 2013 or 2015.,2
Game is currently not loading or working. Otherwise this would be 5 stars,1
Love this game.. Been playing dk since first pc game came out years ago,5
"Lovely game. I wish it wasn't so focused on PvP and provided more single-player options. The matchmaking algorithm seems to be a little unbalanced as well. Still, very enjoyable!",4
"I played this back in the 90s and was excited to see it was available on my tablet. I was tolerating how slow it was to make progress without throwing money at it until all the sudden I got error patch code 1 and nothing i did would clear the problem. I was at dungeon heart level 8 and put a lot, lot, lot of time to get there. Very disappointed. Don't waste you time",2
"Good game, reminds me of the old one but I just got were I was able to unlock the first extra gold mine and clicked on a button that said fb game invite and then the game crashed and I was not able to re open it. Re downloading now hopefully I'm not bugged out of the game",4
"Will take years to make any progress, after a few hours into it the games advancement stops unless you buy coins.",2
"Old school game, this is an intense trap game if you have the time and brain to invest into it... But if you're looking for graphics go take a picture of your mom because all Our Evils are waiting till your dad leavesüòà",5
"Wow EA... Just...Wow....One massive slog or you can burn money to make this run at a playable rate.... Sure, it takes time for minions to dig out a large wall... But I can't queue up jobs. No. You click 1 by 1 per minion. Slow enough that its painful, fast enough that there's no point in closing the app and coming back later. Honestly, this is a seemingly small thing but it's enough for me. Can't plan out what to dig out and then look at something else. You need to micromanage every single cube",1
"A loyal recreation of the original, heavily reminiscent of CoC. Lack of sound controls is annoying.",4
Not very impressed so far. Thought this was a dungeon game but get wrecked by flying units and yet to unlock air defenses. Currently in Bronze I and have been attacked twice by the same guy who is in Dread 3. Didn't think that type of spread was going to happen.,2
"This game is great but my only two problems are the progression and how it doesn't entirely play like the original, like most other games like this the progression eventually gets really slow but this is a new kind of slow, even at low level it takes a long time to save up to get a new building, and my other problem is how it doesn't play like the original, with some of the mechanics taken out like rooms for the monsters or having custom building sizes. Other than those things it's a great game.",4
Good game,5
"Was a good game until a couple days ago when it refuses to open. It trys to load then it just closes, it doesnt get past the EA load screen. I better get my money back if the game isnt going to work. They dont seem to care to fix the problem, they just take your money. 5 months later and still does not open and of course didnt get my money back from in-app purchases...",1
Slap them Imps! Who doesn't love to play an Anti-Hero now and then!?,4
Really fun,4
This game should not have a microtransaction method of funding it. Full released game on PC/Consoles. I really wanted to play this game but why bother since it kept resetting my progress? Way to crash the series into the ground.,1
Awesome game. Always been a fan.,5
"So far it's ok obviously been revised since the old one , I'm still getting used to the newer version but am having fun.",3
Best strategy game Ive played,5
Id give more but app just crashes now. Fix it please,1
"great game, i really love the fighting. its fun to use my battle strategy in this game, because it actually is affective and very interesting",4
Get the real dungeon keeper on GOG with no microtransactions...,1
It's nothing close to what I've come to know and love about this franchise :`[,1
Packers game for the PC,5
First Day Playing And So Far I'm Like It A Lot,4
"Game is funnier than hell. All the sarcastic things the Crypt Keeper says. The watching grass grow pace, well I was hooked. Can't tell you how many times I played it. You ever watch a stupid movie and crack up the whole time? This is one of those. Well good luck on it, kick back n get a chuckle.",4
Pretty lit so far,3
"I would really like to play this game, it seems like a lot of fun, but the connection is so unstable I get disconnected every 10 seconds and I dont have that issue on any other game on my phone, so yeah, bummer",2
Very micro pay dependent.,4
Berry neat,4
Best game ever,5
Exactly like I remember. Lots of problem solving,5
Right now it's not working and I did everything I could to git it dack up,3
So much fun while in quarantine thanks Lot I use to love the PC version,5
Love it. Very much like the old PC game. Nicely done.,5
It's a dungeon clone,1
Great game... if server connections were stable enough to play it.,1
Very fun,5
"Would have been a really great game probably even a 5 star if it weren't for the fact that they insisted on making it PVP, Like so many phone games insist on adding PVP to the game which I can't stand. Would have been nice to have the option to opt out of PVP.",1
"Still Wont let me open the app, just sit on a screen that never does anything",5
"Game was good in the beginning but, once you make gold level anyone can attack you regardless of their level. So your 24th level getting attacked ""randomly"" by people 4 times your ranking.",3
Best strategy out there !,5
I love this game üòä,5
Unexpectedly Fun,4
I've been looking for a game that was like Facebook's Backyard Monsters for years cuz it won't run on a phone. This game should show up in search results for that. Completely different but the closest thing I found awesome game,5
Don't waste your time with this travesty of a game. Once you are finished with the tutorial you'll need to drop an ass load of cash to play. Unless you don't mind taking more then a day to have an imp dig ONE square!,1
I like the game but hate the fact that theres no way to turn off the music and sound effects like the voice. At least I cant find one and I've been looking. You cant even move the screen around without the voice making fun of you.,3
New update is awesome,5
Almost as good as the original game!,5
"I cant wait for this company to collapse under its own weight. The shills out there may praise this game, bc thats pretty much ALL they do. Mindless drones that care more about flash and shine than any degree of substance. This game is a disgusting cash grab, and thats actually putting it lightly. We were supposed to see a Dungeon Keeper 3, but instead we got...this. A barely playable game. Heres some news to shills that defend insanely long wait times: Games are mean to actually be played!!",1
If it werent pay to win this would be a great game. But i cant compete in that market so im out,3
"Seems fun, but it randomly forgot my upgrades but still charged me to do them twice in a row. At that point I dropped the game. Fun for a day or two, but I dont want to be doing the same unlocking missions over and over while losing my progress.",2
Not bad game. Sound is very chopy. But fun. Occasionally disconnects from the server. Just redownloaded... Crashed 4x in less minutes...,1
not an exact duplicate of the original. still dig it,4
"Just started, so far pretty good",3
I missed this game! So happy to be playing again,5
"Kinda corny at times, but a very fun to play game. Glad I found this one.",4
"it takes me back to the old pc games and for a free app it does deserve 5, i do wish i could make my god dungeons like in the pc with all. the fun. of sacrifice and torture but i will submit to the rating gods on that.....unless its added by paid content then it is now age verified =) as of months ago no longer works... hoped for a fix they never responded to email.",1
Loved it on the PC,5
Keeps shutting down. Won't load. Won't go past first Mystic screen.,1
"This game was great for pc, currently downloading now, will post more soon",5
Kills time well,5
Game wont open. Insta crashing. Too many people saying tbe same thing in a game with in game purchases for the devs to be ignoring this for this long....,1
Not exactly the pc game(odviously) but still good. Even though there are in app purchases you can still play without having to use them. For me that is a huge plus!!,5
Best,5
"Great game, loads of fun. My only complaint is the game doesnt direct you to the campaign. It took me awhile before i realized it was a thing.",5
You all ruined a fantastic game serious by doing what you did here and it pains me to think that you all buried this as it's last moment before it died,1
Very cartoony and not true to the original. Not sure if im going to continue playing.,1
"This was my absolute favorite computer game ever made in all I'm so excited that it didn't get forgotten!! Thank you for bringing this game back from the depths !! Wicked as it always was , I'm hoping you can still cast a possession spell to walk & battle through the dungeons like the original computer game!! Very nice graphics on this too!! Will it have the casino with disco inferno sound track , ohhh!! Possessed.. please, say yes!!üòàüòòI love this game!!",5
JoJo reference,5
Used to love DK on PC loving the app as well,5
It keeps on crashing,2
I have bad news and good news a good news is I have a good traps but the bad news is there are very strong players and very tougher traps they have üò¨üò¨üò¨,5
Build times could be shorter. Fun overall.,4
"I was enjoying the game, however as of 9:00am 3/5/2020 my game doesnt open anymore. It just keeps closing right away. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the app cache, I cant figure out what happened.",1
"I love the game, it has connection problem's but otherwise a good game, I rated it a two out of five, because I just went through and did a huge remodel on my dungeon, to then get attacked, and load back in, to see my dungeon was reset to what it was before I changed anything...",2
This game isnt anything spectacurily original but its defintely a fun one with some nice graphics and a good sense of humor,4
"Crashes constantly, cant connect to servers",1
Disgusting EA practices. Cant progress unless you pay. Hope they go bankrupt.,1
3 words. Pay to win,1
Can not load the game since last update.,1
It gets harder but you get to have a brake after you been raided once not 12 times a day,5
I used to play the originals back on the PC back n the day lol,5
I wish you gained power faster.,4
Good game hard to put down,5
"So, this seems to be the only place i can actually type and have someone else read it. as the forums don't get any response and the website tells you to go to the forums. I have been trying to contact people since before december. i bought 2 different gems packages and received neither of them nor the promised free imp with first gem purchase. please someone get back to me that can help.",3
Love the game since DK 1.,5
Im Goddd,5
Fun game.,4
I played this game as a teen on PC. I think it's great that it's back ....now only 3* because of the extreme time windows .....such long wait. Cool little animations and fun battle game,3
I love this game though it is dificult later on and I know I misspelled the 7th word I'm tired cut me some slack,5
Classic game loved it then love it now but.... they need to look into there loading.... kills the mood....,4
Interesting,4
Decent mobile game by itself w/out comparing it to its far better PC predecessor. Time periods to accomplish things suck like most mobile games but is fun to play,4
"I tried this game a few years ago when it first came out, wasn't impressed back then. Been playing a couple of weeks now and I've got to say it has improved a great deal. Great job.",5
"This game is a cash grab! Real time waits (up to 24 hours) for some tasks...unless you want to pay real money! Do not waste your time with this one, it sucks!",1
Won't launch,1
"So far so good,",5
Cash grab,1
Needs more minions. Otherwise great game.,4
Awsome,5
Fun game! Just wish regen times were shorter! Still a fun game with lots of upgrades 4 years later!,4
It would be allot better if this could be played offline also. Connection issues make it unplayable. But otherwise it's okay accept for all the attempts to get you to spend money.,3
Cant turn the sound off. Cant actually customize much. Nothing really unique about the game.,1
It's really fun easy to play but the PC version is so much better it's still really fun,4
"This is a fortress building game where you can pit your own strategies against others. Also, in-app purchases exist, but not essential to have fun... That's getting more and more rare nowadays. Awesome game =D",5
"Great tutorial. Easy to learn, lots of fun to play. Recommended.",4
Interesting game play and lay out.,4
"It's a great game, but the matchups suck. It kind of ruins the game when you are to protect your dungeon from players that are of a way higher level and when you have to attack much higher level players.",3
Awsomeness!!! Played this game since I was 10 on pc.,5
It's just doesn't compete with the original pc version.,2
Super fun game!!,5
Reminds me of the older computer version of this classic game!!!,4
"From what I can see, this is the most in-depth tutorial I've ever seen in a game that actually teaches you. They make sure that even kids know how to play, and there are subtle adult jokes everywhere fitting with the theme. Probably my favorite game for tutorial characters as well, considering how it plays out. Simple, easy, quick, but also informative!",5
It ok slow,3
"So much money needed to play. Now that I've played it a little longer, it's downright awful.",1
It's clash of clans,1
"Designed to be a money sink, not a good game.",1
Won't load anymore. I want a refund for all the money I spent on this game. NOW.,1
The game doesnt even open. Its trash,1
"I prefer the original, but this is a better option than digging out a Pentium 3.",4
DUNGEON KEEPERS GOLD GOBLINS MORE GOLD UNLIMITED FUN,5
It's fun and additive. Played this when it was on pc,5
Hell ya,5
Good game,5
Game will no longer start,1
"I like this game, so far so good.",5
"This app is way better than it was when it first came out. It's actually playable without hitting the ""pay wall"" in first hour. Enjoying it slot so far!",5
Only similar to the original PC game. The game strings you along until you almost have enough gems and then almost doubles the required amount. This is to push you into making in app purchases. Pretty crappy!,1
Good stuff,4
I love it,5
Would be 5 stars but only being able to play when on WiFi sucks. I am barely home. F*** I pay for unlimited data on my phone for a reason. What's wrong with using cellular signal too??????,4
Underrated strategy and is f2p friendly despite some reviews. Needs a global chat though.,5
For the best and the rest,5
Crashes upon launching,1
"Fun! Seem to have worked out previous bugs, fun to play and kill some time",5
Closest to the original we're probably gonna get,5
Cool game,5
Lack of any instruction kind of a let down,1
"Has the feel of the old pc game. Matchmaking is horrible and broken. First hour of playing I got attacked by someone 33k more points, used 1 monster and wiped me out. Only way to grow dungeon is through PVP. Fun for a few days at best. Depends how fast and how often the big spenders find you. EA please fix match making raids, based off medals or dungeon heart level or something!!!!",3
Love this game,5
"Ok, soo i played this when it was on pc. Now its an app. Wicked good fun with Horny cauzein mayhem and destruction. Defi,ige money eater if you play that way. But for these guys....Hell yes ill support them and the game. Takes time and patience. Just give it a shot.",5
Fun and amusing,3
Keeps stopping. Can not play any more. Reinstalling dose not work.,1
"Kinda hard to get started, heavy on the pay to win",2
Not the same as the original wish it was more like it,3
Seems good,4
Game crashes to much would be more fun if it that problem was fixed,2
Can we just pay for games and stop all this in games purchases. I know u guys are trying to make money but can I just pay for the game and enjoy. I miss bull frog,2
"the nostalgia of the game its self is great, i love it. the only issue i have is how heavily pay-to-win it is.... to all original DK's out there i say get it just cause you can.. to people who dont know what im talking about... dont worry about it your dungeon was bound to fail anyways",4
App is broken,1
"Played it for years, and had some fun. Unfortunately the clan flag stopped working after the last update. Tried to uninstall and re-install, but the game will no longer start. :(",1
"Very much like the original, lots of fun so far...",5
Game won't load at all,1
Awesome! Haven't played in years and love this new version,5
keeps stopping,1
You really should make it that only people in your rank can attack you or for you to attack. Also your defend event sucks. Wave 5 has dragons n i barely have anything to defend against those you really dont give us enough anti stuff. Plus for wave 5 i got 1k as a prize but it cost me 65 k for all the traps n troops to replace how is that even worth doing. Your event needs fixing.,3
Nice,5
"Played on my phone for months then just crashed ended up deleting cause it never worked again. Now have on daughters tablet, we will see??",3
Loved the original DK. Happy to play it again.,5
great game love the old dungeon keeper,4
"I like how simple it is to play, but upgrading the Dungeon Heart is difficult. I am new to this version, having been a long-time fan of the original PC version. Would give five stars if there was an indicator of how long the protection from attacks lasts. As I need to increase my Heart level raiding. Or campaigning, which would be better. But that's just my opinion.",4
You got to get this game,5
So are the servers down Game will stay in a continuous load,5
It's silly... and suprisingly addictive,4
Great game,5
How is this game rated so highly. I call shenanigans. 24 hours to break one block? Pay real money to reduce timers? Absolutely a cash grab game. It's sad DK has been reduced to this garbage.,1
"Very cool, addictive game.",5
Super fun until money or extreme time are the only things that can move you forward.,4
Fun and reminds me of the old games,4
I loved this game and had given it a 4 star but now it's a 1 because I can't load the game. Nothing was updated the game just crashes on load. I've read the help faq which are no help... this exact thing happened before when I had this game I'd hoped they'd have fixed it. I have played hours and am at lvl 7 dungeon but it now won't even load far enough to submit a help ticket. Sad :(,1
"This game was extremely fun. Now, it has developed an error at the EA game screen on loading. Would love to be able to play my game again",1
Great throw back game with a guild system added,5
"I grew up on DK and DK2. This game is great! If you liked DK before, you'll like this!",5
"Within hours of posting my negative review the app will not start. Never had a problem before. Guess EA can't handle the truth. Do you like to waste time? Do you Love to pay for the privilege of winning? Are games that force you to pay if you want any hope of winning your thing, then this is the game for you! It is simple, don't pay and try to save resources, you will be raided mercilessly and matched against impossible odds. Fun at first, then the cheating begins. you pay or give up.",1
This app does the original game justice just wish I could play offline,5
So far lots o fun!,5
Almost as good as the original,4
Has ludicrous amount of micro transactions that make it practically unplayable,1
It's a great game. However currently unplayable. Everytime it logs into Google play it crashes. I can't find a way to troubleshoot other than give a comment. Gameplay is fun. Controls are well explained. Graphics range from fun to cute to simple.,2
A bad Clash clone. No Dungeon Keeper soul,2
I wasnt't expecting this to be so interesting. I think I'll enjoy it a good bit more.,5
The game won't open... Been a few days now so unistalled it and loaded it again... Still don't work?,1
It wasn't the original one,1
Fun classic game,5
Still can't sign in with Google play games. Crashes on launch. No replies from Devs at Google play games. Missing out on another tournament because of this. Any fix in sight?,4
"Most recent update broke game, now it crashes immediately after launching. Wasted a few dollars on a now inaccessible game. Poor showing EA",1
"I loved the original on PC. Been playing this one for years off and on... it's okay. If you're new, expect that it will take a long time to get a decent dungeon. Of course you can go faster by spending tons of money... it's basically Clash of Clans that's skinned for DK. Most recently it stopped working on my Samsung Galaxy S9 plus. (Dec 2019) For the last couple of weeks it crashes on opening. I rebooted the phone, wiped the cache, even un/reinstalled. Frustrating.",2
"Glitchy as hell, but I do like the take from an old game on my phone as opposed to PC.",3
Was 5 stars up until the game no long works. I spent money on this and time. Not cool EA. Cant get past the loading screen before it crashes. If not resolved I want a refund.,1
Ezcellent game wish traps reset automatically other than that very fun game,4
"Just crashes on trying to open and EA doesn't seem to care. Been doing this for days now. Really I preferred the original ones anyway. Some plots you can dig instantly, but then there are the 2 hours and 6 hours ones. This one's a money grabber.",1
Love this game. I got it working.,5
New update broke the app. As soon as the update logged into the Google account the game crashes to the desktop. Since the new update it crashes as it launched. Reinstalled it and logs in then crashes the app when starting see the first screen only,4
"Was a good game until it crashed and became unopenable. And just after I bought gems. Sent feedback reports and an email, zero response. Sort it out EA!",1
Tons of code 7 lost making the game unpleasant. Also goes to suspend mode way to fast then the fame has to reload. And reconnect to the server witch gives another code 7,2
This app was great but now crashes at start everytime I open.. I cleared the memory and still it crashes. Must be the update to app.,1
EA is EAing out in this one bro,1
Unbelievably additive,4
"Good graphics, smooth gameplay and brings bacj memories",5
"The peak of EA's anti-consumer behavior. Buy a beloved game franchise. Fire everyone who made it great. Replace with grred, manipulation, and complete disregard for fans of the source. Can't rate below five stars too.",1
Fun so far been playing about 2 days. Good humor fun gameplay. Will update later.,5
I love this game Ty for fixing this problem I had with it,5
Sound is a little off,3
"We loves it my We loves it my preshous... just started, and I am intrigued already.",5
Was great until it kept crashing. Deleted it over the frustration.,2
"If it's ever updated, so it'll actually launch on a Pixel 3, like every other game, I'll update the review.",1
Wow that tutorial is ridiculous. Why the hell dont you let us skip that. We get it weve all played games before. I cannot rate any game highly when they assume you are stupid,1
"I thought this was the classic Dungeon Keeper game when I downloaded it, but it's not. It's a poor, mobile knockoff version of it. This Dungeon Keeper is your standard pay-to-win, PvP (to get you competitive so you spend more money) town maker/raider game with a dungeon theme. Save yourself time and money; pass on this.",1
"Very fun, i wish you dont have to spend alot of money to get big.",4
So rn im only having issues with the game because it signed me out of the profile i was using and used a differebt one and will not switch back if i am able to correct this i will change my reveiw to five stars the game play is nice but this issue is infuriating,1
I love the game but plz make imps cheaper,5
Fun Like building castles in sand,5
An excellent game.,5
"EA making crappy multiplayer games as always. This time they have gone to far ! By screwing up a classic game I happened to love on pc. This is not dungeon keeper not Evan close. The main thing that ruined it for me is the shity graphics for the troops, they look like papar cut outs. This is nothing like dungeon keeper. This pissed me off so much I will never buy anything EA games ever .",1
Awesome üëç,5
Meh... I hate EA,4
Another pay2win game. You don't have a chance against those who have $$$ to burn on pixels.,1
Fun,4
I love this game. Kills time and is super fun.,5
Pretty smooth and nice mobile port,5
Basically a cheap iOS remake of the original dungeon keeper with pay to win bonuses.,2
Very close to the original!,5
Loved the pc games so glad to see it back,5
It's cool,5
"Fun game. However I can't give you more than three stars because I feel that there is a serious issue with match making. How am I able to be raided by a player with 16,818 trophies and I only have 883 trophies? There is a clear issue with this. People should only be able to raid those in the same tier.",3
"too slow, this was a real fun game before time base turns",2
I got excited and really wanted to play this game because I grew up playing the original 2 on my laptop. This game wont even unpack the software and i have an LG Stylo 5. That is shameful. Please fix this Dungeon Keeper belongs on mobile.,1
The game doesnt work it wont open at all,1
An insult,1
I was saving up the gems to buy another imp. I got past halfway from my goal and the price jumped by nearly 500 gems. Since EA decided to give me the finger let this 1 star review represent me returning the gesture.,1
"Developers clearly don't want you to play this game unless you spend money every day. Also, there are a lot off missed opportunities. The original games were enjoyable in part because you could interact with minions and watch them interact with each other. This was also part of managing the dungeon. The devs should look to that style of game play, especially considering the wait times for upgrades. It would give players something to do while we wait and maybe I wouldn't mind as much.",3
Cool game üòâ,5
Game Effin Rocks,4
"This is an old one that I'm thankful has been reproduced for mobile. I've actually not seen an ad yet, and I've only spent $4.99 for a free builder. They give you enough for the third. It's way more fun (so far) than the GoW clones.",5
Sux,1
Cant get by lots of quests. Stuck where im at. Cant raid for defeat. I get raided and defeated.,1
Money hungry. Bad gameplay. Not like older game. EA i think you have enough cash. Once again a ruined franchise that will never see the light of day. Pathetic. You know life isnt just about money.,1
Thank you for bringing one of my all time favorite games to mobile. Great job,5
"Power balance is completely unbalanced. Many of the traps do little at higher levels and you just end up being attacked by only those who can bust your walls making the traps null anyway. Perhaps there's a different stragegy, but the meta was very frustrating to deal with.",2
Ok,1
AWSOME GAME!,5
Great game...tower defense + town building + classic pc game. Rating downgraded from 5/5 to 2/5 due to frequent connection issues making it almost unplayable,2
Love it!,5
it's a very entertaining game..,5
Pretty good,4
Crashes everytime I leave the screen even if just for 1 second. It even while leaving this review,3
Not quite the same as on the PC but enjoyable.,4
"Set this game on fire. If you like addictive gambling elements and instant gratification via purchasing premium currency to rush the elements of this game which force it into a boring slog, then This game is for you... I need an editor.",1
"I love the creative dungeon building, but I can't attack other people because it just decides to reload and I lose it",2
This is just a money hungry game and whoever made it should be a shamed for ruining the dungeon keeper I loved as a kid. This isn't even close. They could have done better and still kept it free to play. I'm a shamed of myslef for wanting to be a game dev and you should know that it's people like you killing the fun of games.,1
This game it's by far the most garbage I've ever played and have ever seen thank you EA but Bethesda did it better better meaning making a game that sucks,1
"Dont spend money on this,.battles disconnect randomly and you lose your winning streak , which is important in this game. Fun for time waste but not a serious game to invest money in due to lack of stability. Wish i knew that before I spent $40",1
"Surprisingly better than I expected from EA. The dungeon design aspect is there! Still has lots of stupid faults. ""Do you want to reconnect to the server"" ""Yes."" Seriously. Why ask that? The core of good UD design is to not make the user jump through hoops unless the hoops are fun.The user implicitly wants the game to reconnect - don't ask, just do it! Same for the rest of the obvious error messages. Just log it and move on! Also lacking a watch ad for gems. Look into rare resource allocation",3
Yay,5
Fun to play reminds me of clash of clans.,5
It's a good time killer,4
This is one of the best games ever!! Almost exactly like when I played it on PC so many years ago. Would love to see it continued and easier to find. I never knew it was here on the store. Very happy to have this gem!,5
MICROTRANSACTIONS.....MONETIZATION....That's all this game is and EA had GOOGLE take off all NEGATIVE REVIEWS. So I'm just here to remind everyone. Dont waste your time. Just go download jumper. You'll have way more fun anyways,1
A little slow execution,4
It ok. Not as good as the originals but it ok.,3
EA can spend 29.99 to buy 1000 Emotion Gems from me and for a mere 750 Emotion Gems I will change this rating to 5 stars for 7 days!,1
"This game has a lot of problems, the first being it has bugs including crashing mid raid, and crashing when you try to boost your imps, and the second one is if you're dungeon is under attack you can't do anything till it's done.",1
Excellent,5
They let much higher levels attack lower level dungeons. Then you run out of gold to arm your traps. It's an annoying spiral of despair,1
"Ok, but it's not the original and basically is a pay to play if you want more than 3 minutes at a time",4
"It meh, very watered down from the original. Bruins back some memories bigger it's $4.99 for this boost driven. Just sad if you played the original it kinda ruins it.",2
Excellent,5
"Fun, not pay to play, money just makes you go faster",5
this is about the 3rd release of Dungeon Keeper,4
A blast from the past. I played the original on PC back in the 90's. So far this adaptation is pretty good. I'd love to see another PC version.,5
Love Dungeon Keeper 2 and this. Wishing for the end of the trilogy,5
"Not as good as the original game but still entertaining. This game is more challenging tho, which is good for some, not for others. I love they kept the same overlord's voice! I prefer certain aspects of the original over this version; there was more freedom to explore, more characters and rooms but this does the job for now.",4
"Not quite the Dungeon Keeper I remember, but they did keep a lot of it, including the crude humor. They've done a pretty good job.",4
I love playing this game so much I'm going to read download it onto my laptop the real full game.,5
Reminds me of the old days when I was playing this on the PC,4
"A fun time killer. Micro transactions suck, but that's the way it goes.",4
It is so so,3
"This app sucks! I am not a hypocrite. The beginning is pretty fun but after a while the gameplay gets boring and the dungeon building... The dungeon building sucks, when you remove tiles it takes forever. And the rooms are overpriced and the microtransactions get crazy. A tile took 24 hours to remove it took 246 gems to remove. I would write more but you get the gyst",2
Good,4
"It's a great game, but it's hard to get gems",4
P2W. Bullfrog would be so disappointed.,2
Super fun and funny,4
I played dungeon keeper 2 extensively when it came out new so when I saw this I absolutely had to get it and am enjoying it as much as I did dungeon keeper 2 all those years ago. Thank you so much for releasing this updated version!!,5
"I enjoy it a lot, getting your hands on gems is fairly easy.",4
"Been looking for this game for years, thanks and great job",5
Super fun to play as an overlord. Mwahahaha.,5
Boring slow.,1
Good game,5
This game is really fun at first but it becomes borring and expensive really fast.... I wish it was more like the original dungeon keeper games because those are so much more fun...,2
 ï‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢ î  ï‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢ î  ï‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢ î,3
Its cool,5
Very close to the old pc game we know and loved.,5
This game is so fun!!! It brings back memories from the original DK2,5
Awesome,5
"Good game and I love everything you've done with it so far, it does cost alot of gems to upgrade things but I expected that in this type of game, the gameplay is good and I love the idea for the dungeon heart, the only way to upgrade it is win in PvP base battles and that's the first time I've ever seen a game have that feature, overall good game and by far one of the best I've played, keep up the good work and I'll be looking forward to more updates and features to come",5
Seems like the game is not supported anymore.,2
Awesome,5
This is not dungon keeper. So very very wrong. I feel lied to,1
Awesome,5
Amazing!!Brings back tons of memories.,5
"A lot of work went into this game, the graphics and the interface. But i haven't played it on years because it takes to long to accumulate materials. Tried to play but soon remembered why i deleted this app.",2
"During battles, Raids, and even sitting on my dungeon the game crashes every few minutes. It tells me the imps need to get my dungeon in order. I realize that this typically means a disconnect from the internet however it happens everywhere. I've tried playing at home, work, college, and even parks and this happens. I really enjoy the game when it allows me to play but now I'm getting tired of it. I'll try downloading this in a month to try again. Until then I'm afraid this stays at 2 stars.",2
Actually tried to play this. Made it through the tutorial levels. Discover that the game is ome of the worst money grabs available. EA should lose the rights to the IP for this crapware. Uninstalled.,1
Fun game but geta real tedious trying to gather gems to buy more imps. Outside of that fun concept good controls and lots of fun when you actually get imps to feel like your making progress,4
Brings me back to its pc origins..overall great experience..build/upgrade times could be slightly lowered but not bad,4
Is great,5
Blatant cash grab based on a beloved franchise.,2
1st amendment allows me to provide negative feedback against EA. Putin de mere EA.,1
Wish it was more like the pc version where you build rooms the way you used to be able to.,5
Wayyyyy!!!! Awesome!!!!! Don't be a goblin...join in and spread the evil fun.,4
When i was 11I loved this game so much. I'm 13 now. I forgot the name but i suddenly remembered the name,5
By far addictive,4
Fun fun its an upgrade to the orignal,5
"I was so excited to have this game back. I played with some rose tinted glasses at first, but I eventually realized how neutered the game is under EA. Do yourselves a favor and try to find the original PC versions somewhere and play those instead.",1
Loved this on the pc... Now i can play it again!,5
Fun,4
Dead app. No longer being supported. No updates in over a year.,1
Scummy freeyoplay model,1
Like old times,5
fun game,5
Excellent game.,5
"Typical ""pay to not wait"" kind of game. Pretty much Clash of Clans in a dungeon setting, except worse. The first time you log out your dungeon will be immediately raided by higher level players. Be prepared to drop a lot of money into this game if you want to be ""good"" at it.",1
I love it it's excellent,5
Perfect,5
"This game is just confusing to me, why turn Dungeon Keeper, arguably the least known franchise that EA owns, and make it into this weird Clash Of Clans type of game. Just stay away from this game, its really not worth your time, just play Clash Of Clans.",1
Throwback game. Love it,5
Pay-to-win Microtransaction Garbage,1
It's fun,4
shameless cash grab,1
Keepers keep on keeping!! BAD ASS!!,5
so far good game not a lot of adds,4
i hate it it would not load 1 star,1
money grab,1
"I played dungeon keeper 1 and 2 this is just a mockery of those great games. EA should make a proper game but, that is doubtful as they would try and put up pay walls and DLC to make an extra buck. Then they wonder why gamers hate them.",1
what can i say its a classic,5
"Way too many ""disconnected from server"" and ""please wait while your imps get dungeon in order"". If this happens during a raid, instant loss for you!! Glad I didn't pay money for this. Not worth one cent with these obnoxious glitches!!!! Update: over the years problem hasnt been fixed. In fact it has gotten so bad devs seem to have stopped accepting feedback!!!",1
it is good but everyting takes so long after a while,4
never found a dungeon/defence game I've enjoyed as much as this. as a D&D nerd this really does it for me.,5
They turned dungeon keeper into clash of clans. Bastards.,1
Try this game on a moto g lite. After a wile It does a load loop and never let's you finish combat... Ever!,5
money app,1
"Fun in the begining, but the build timers start getting ridiculously long after a few days of building. On top of that, your dungeon can be raided by way way higher level guys, basically making it pointless to try to build a challenging dungeon. I wouldn't mind paying a bit to invest, but these blights would need to change first. I'll probably uninstall soon.",2
EA strikes again with Pay to Win. Tournament rewards are a joke. Match making for raids is horribly unbalanced. Not at all like the original version on PC. Shameful.,1
I've played this game for 6 years it's one of my favorites ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,5
"I played this game when I was 7 and I've just found it again, love playing it even if i had to start over",5
11/10 gamer moment generator,5
it's awesome but I wish the imps could work faster taking solid wall.,5
good game,5
"Not as fun as classic dungeon keeper, but fun none the less.",4
Sad that the dungeon keeper series ends in micro transactions!,2
loved DK you should play this its great,5
"Won't load up, stuck in the connecting buffer, after several attempts all I got was a pop up box asking for my phone number or email but I'm not giving up either one for just a game that's probably going to spam me....uninstalled and it's still trying to connect lmao",1
awesome,5
"100$= roughly 50 blocks... in the original it was 15$= all the blocks exept the unbreakable ones. this game isn't ""dungeon keeper"", its ""microtransaction, the game"".",1
"the game would let me play, I was unable to leave tutorial",1
i used to play this game on the computer when i was younger. This is still just as fun then as it is now. Great game I love it,5
This is NOT Dugeon Keeper... Its just styled to look like Dungeon Keeper.,1
"when this first came out the microtransactions made this seem like the devils anus of mobile games, but now that every mobile game manipulates you for your cold hard cash, its not as bad :/ (then again, ive never played the original dungeon keeper, so i might play that and then come back later to hate on this game)",3
ok so far but it appears to be building to a point that buying in game money will not be avoidable. too bad freemium rarely works well and i would gladly pay for version without the gem nonsense.,2
This games 4.0 rating proves that game reviews on here are rigged.,1
Not Like the Original Classic,3
fairly good game mechanics reasonable gameplay could probably easily be entertained for hours a good way to kill time I would say,3
great nostalgia from the old computer classic,5
horrible game don't try nothing like original or 2 even,1
I think this is a fun time waster.,4
love it really fun.,5
"need new demons,traps other than a upgrade awesome",5
"absolutely love this game, so much fun and I always lose track of time when I'm planning it!",5
unique game and gameplay!,4
This game sucks donkey balls. It's an insult to the original Dungeon Keeper franchise.,1
great game!! brings back memories from the originals,5
best fun ever had playing a game,5
cool,4
Don't like his shotgun chin,1
so far sogood,5
good game,5
Big fan of the first two games but this one here had me quitting in less then thirty minutes. Does not do the series any justice.,1
"I really liked this game. I played basically non-stop for a week, and it's super addictive. But it's also pointless. What is the goal? To build an unbeatable dungeon? If you don't pay to win, that could take months, maybe years. Development is well paced early on, but once you have wait times past 8 hours and you only have 4 imps, you can't really do much. Plus, the constant loading is ridiculous.",2
Just more freemium trash. Don't waste your time.,1
solid,5
bloody amazing,5
a cash grab.,1
very disappointed makes me wish bullfrog was still around making games because this is horrible it's like a clash of clans clone and nothing like DK from back in the day I was hoping this would bring me back to when I was younger but sadly its nothing like the originals its very disappointing,1
my mother just poured a pan of hot grease down my back,5
great game,5
very fun,5
never got to play because it keeps kicking me off the game,1
I use to play dungeon keeper. this app was disappointment on a grand scale,1
the game is very fun and dungeon building is addictive,5
"Its like clash of clans, but as if u were a villian! It has a whole, rpg vibe to it, mainly cause of the artstyle. clash of clans was a little, boring. honestly, this game is way more my style!",5
Cash grab app soiling the dk name.,2
I like this game it feels sort of like dungeon keeper 2 but just the building and working with imps not as fast but I understand that it's for mobile and you cant have that much AI in a mobile game otherwise I say you did perfect with what you had,5
sucks,1
It's made by EA so it is obviously good.,5
personaly you should have stuck ith the beta a friend of mine sad this is dungeon overlord yall just changed the name however after playing its more like castleclash...,1
I'm surprised this abomination still exist. Just another EA attempt to get all the money by using the Play2Wait freemium model as well as Pay2Win transaction for PvP. This game is a slap to the face of the originals and those who played the originals. EatAss ruins another beloved franchise.,1
not quite like the original but still a fun supplement,4
this game is in a very enjoyable fun and if you have free time this game will keep you occupied,3
"this is just a clash of the clans clone, does not have any of the heart and sole of the original bullfrog game. so sad. also it's fake. I just raided 3 dungeons all exactly the same layout, gold amounts and level, different names... looks like nobody Is actually playing this pile of trash.",1
A lot of pay to win. The game turned out to be with a pay wall and will push for their gems as often as they can.,1
only 8 minuets were needed for me to realise that this app is a waste of storage. EA should be ashamed!,1
great,5
Just as fun as I remember on the PC. Great rendition of a classic.,5
not taking my money with a pay wall nice try.,1
"The only walls this app erects is PAY WALLS. It comes complete with money-pit, and cask traps.",1
fun!!! different what's been missing,5
alot of fun,5
"I first downloaded this app back when I was like 13, thought it was the greatest app I've played. I still do to this day. The only app that seconds it is Fallout Shelter. I redownloaded it today. And I am still just as amazed today as I was 5 years ago.",5
sucks,1
its not bad for a typical mobile game but its a mobile game made by ea,3
So boring it is equivalent to turning pages in a book with no story line. More like a toy than a game. Gives you just enough control to put you in a position to require spending money on things that should be free. Ultra lame.,2
the graphics are beautiful and it is way more fun than clash of clans and boom beach.,5
love the game,5
I would pay for a dungeon keeper style game that didnt have this stupid rush what you are trying to do button that eventually you would have to pay for. design a decent game and people will pay for it. stop the cash grab that just piggybacks on the title of a decent game/movie,1
"I missed this game, thanks for bringing it up to mobile apps üëç",5
great game,5
it is very fun and i really enjoy the game,5
"The cash shop is comparatively over priced, which is GOOD because I would spend even more on this application for an expierance that would actually feel rewarding because the game itself is a surprisingly interesting adaptation on an personal favorite.",4
"I had initially given this game 5 stars but had to reduce it. Fun game however, when it glitches or you get a call while you are attacking a dungeon it will reload you at the beginning and lose your winning streak and what ever Immortal you have captured. This is provided you have used an Immortal and not gain a star. I have lost several Immortals this way; more so with glitches.",3
"who ever pushed the dragon immortal through quality control was a moron. Pay to win as you can buy a flying immortal early and the game has no answer for it until late game. either buy the dragon or dont play, simple.",1
"The original PC version of the game was WAY better than this. They took a very playable game and over complicated it. EA, you spoiled a good thing.",1
"The original game was great. This version is a blatant money grab, and has taken what should have been a pleasant nostalgic experience and turned it into another example of what is wrong with freemium games. No one will continue to play a game that has something to click once every day or two, so this game is clearly meant to exploit young people and anyone with impulse control issues, and not meant to actually be played in a ""free"" or even limited cost fashion.",1
I loved the original dungeon keeper. This one wants you to sink money into it to enjoy more game play time unlike it's predecessor. Will continue playing....for now.,3
awsome,5
Every time i get halfway through an event raid it feels the need to get my dungeon in order... game is garbage. One of the worst games ive plaid on a droid... n its EA. Go figure,4
good,3
cool,4
"the original is 1000 times better, that is all.",1
brings back the old thats for sure i love it i really liked dk2,5
it could've gotten higher rating but it was extremely glitchy and restarted my dungeon twice,3
"Really cool dungeon keep game that helps u in the beginning, then sets u free to do as u wish. awesome graphics and gameplay make this a must have!!",5
Disappointingly pay to win. Excessive wait times extend gameplay with uninteresting mechanics.,1
awesome,5
it's fun!,5
brings back memories of the original with upgrades and improvements.,5
Great game! Reminds me of PC version immensely.,5
"I beat Dungeon Keeper 2 back in the day. This is missing some of my favorite features, but that's understandable considering it's a mobile app and not a traditional computer platform. Bonus points that I can play it with my son without worrying about some of the more... graphic aspects of DK2? I'm enjoying the *$!@ out of this game! :D",4
"Decent overall. Seems to be a little pay to win, but otherwise great gameplay and concepts.",4
"great strategy game, takes a bit to get into but really good.",5
All Keepers are not equal. Content is heavy time-gated/pay-walled. Don't claim your West most gold mine if you decide to play.,1
"love this game, and hate slotomania",5
joke of a game,1
reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper which I like,5
"Great game ,unfortunately 30 days ago it's interface with Google play got broken, I now have to uninstal, and reinstall to log into Google play.",4
lol nuff seid,5
some days you just need to slap someone imps are a safe alternative to step children call me slap happy . and the game is always good to fill in your lunch break,4
"interesting strategy game with dark humor. Both attack, and defend component. currently has a major bug logging into Google play with note 4.",4
First of all its not Dungeon Keeper. Its closer to an expaned tower defense game. Second of all it sucks because the totality of the game play is now bases around buying gems and stupid challenges.,2
Fun but extremely frustrating. I am finally quitting because I cannot keep up with the needed upkeep of my dungeon. 1) The upkeep price for resetting traps forces you to raid other dungeons multiple times during the day. 2) the game keeps crashing/displaying loading dungeon screen which causes me to lose the raid and any resources spent. Summary: Need to raid to survive but cannot complete a raid due to app bugs. The game is now unplayable and Uninstalling.,2
Love it,5
"meh, i like it",4
awesome,5
This cost you your series of victories which is a significant factor in the game.,1
terrible microtransaction,1
"it would have gotten five stars, but the lack of gems without a purchase make the game slower going!!!...... plus it gets a bit twitchy at times...... other than that...... i love it!!!.......",4
ti is graet,5
"unplayable, the server disconnects mid mission and then you lose. can't reconnect or login. EA is the worst company for support. no response for their failure.",1
I like the dungeon master theme to this game.,5
ditto,5
"I really like this game, it's wait times are a bit long an I never pay money for games but lol I just did on this one, 4 stars",4
"Loved the original old school PC game. Close to the original PC game, totally give it a 5star if it wasn't for how long an the cost of upgrades, an leveling.. an constant crashes. I've uninstalled, never ever any good updates either I've dropped my star rating to a 1.. I don't think you guys actually read or take our advice anyway..",1
"why do i NEED internet to play a single player game.. this reason alone gets 1 star. the orginal was 10x beter. custom room sizes beats these 2x2 3x3 rooms. lame money grabbing tactics in every game gets old quick. i have played some amazing games from 1 person indie developers so there is no real need to have wait times in hopes of people buying gems to bypas wait times. just add some custom units only cash can get you , a donations link or some other way that doesnt make games pointless.",1
"awesome game. no bugs, no issues. easy controls. well thought out gameplay",5
Good to see Dungeon Keeper back!,5
good,5
Its pretty good of dungeons and monsters,5
"I fondly remember this game from years ago. Sadly it failed to run on my phone. It installed the latest patch and sat there... loading... after 10 minutes, I gave up. Forced closed it, and re-opened. Same thing, wouldn't run. Uninstalled.",1
very different from the original in terms of free play..building time...and of course the cost....a little disappointed. was expecting it to play like original..but didnt.,2
don't like games where you lose resources simply by not playing them. why can some one attack me when i'm not even playing?,1
"could be bettet without the micro transaction. i loved the old dungeon hunter, this is good to but could be much better off without the micro transactions... I hate devs charging you for every little thing they can, why do mocro transactions exist niw?! Dont you get enough from us already by buying the games?!?!? I do not mind supporting devs if its somthibg like map packs or exapnsion DLCs but micro transactions and cosmetics is where i draw the line!!",3
"I'm tired of idler games. I'm sure this is fine but i was looking for warcraft. This is yet another ""pay real money or go away and come back in an hour"" game.",2
It's pretty fun.,4
dirt patches not removable!!! this game is nothing like the old school keeper game don't waste you time just go out and buy the original,1
pay to do stuff evey time with gem why ea why?,1
go away ea we all hate you,1
You should be able to skip the stupid tutorials. my account got erased. been playing for years. wasted all my time for nothing. thanks ea.,1
I love this game..used to play on my PC with my dad when i was younger...wish it didn't take so long to dig up gems though..still love the game,4
sweet,5
I loved the pc version of this game. so far it's about the same so I hope to love this version.,5
a very good tribute to the old game. made me extremely happy to find it and the game itself doesn't disappoint. keep it up guys!! 5 stars!,5
still new to the game so far so good... 3 day in,4
Fun Strategy Game as an üî•Evil Incarnationüî• creating your own little Slice of Hell in your Filthy Demonic Dungeon with help of a few Spawns of Hell. Than Pillage your Demented black chard heart out with immortal champions at your side! Has a bit of an OverLord feel to it. All the way down to beating your Imps to Remind the to work harder haha Well worth it üëçTons of Laughs Highly Recommended! Ya Filthy Animals,5
It's a overall fun game and it is a bit nostalgic. Still was hoping for the original more so. Fingers are crossed ey!,4
Love this game,5
( it's very fun and strategic when it wants to work and wants to load it's been a while since I've played but brings back old memories just wish you would reload again and let me play,3
Terrible. Not a game. Nothing but microtransaction filled corpse of a beloved game series.,1
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,2
To Rule !! Ic 4 Pone,5
"The game keeps on disconnecting me from the internet in the middle of battles! I lose all of my creatures that were used, and even if I am at 90 percent destruction, the game counts it as a loss!!!!!",2
"money grubby, takes forever to get things done",1
I enjoyed playing Dungeon Keeper 2 on the PC and I did enjoy this,4
Very cool game.,5
Slow at start u have to pay to get anything done in a decent anount of time. update this review is from 2014 and still stands just opened it up after downloading it and i don't understand how this piece of garbage has 4 stars,1
"It was five star fun to play game a couple of years ago ,but now its boring no Major events, updates, or specials to keep seasoned players interested. Seems like the games on Auto Pilot.",2
fantastic game needs more starting imps,5
YA JUST GOTA KNOW HOW 2 TREAT YER SLAVES!!!üòàüëÅÔ∏èü¶ç,5
"very addictive, very fun!",5
"With the latest update, I love it even more. Now to be fair I think the time scale is idiotic and suppresses the game tremendously. I am ok with only playing for a few minutes a couple of times a day. But it could be so much more. I'm not going to spend much money on it the way it is now though.",5
You can't spell healthcare without EA.,1
"Well Done, Richard. Your voice puts the vil in villany.",5
"Total pay to win dreck. A good rendition of the classic dungeon keeper, but ruined by micro-transactions and timer based events.",2
Reminds me of the good old days when I sat in front of a computer playing the original DK. Just wish that you can pick who you can raid instead of it being random.,4
so its asome,5
Its an EA product... what do you expect? Of course its going to be pay 2 win and full of microtransactions.,1
"Riding the success of old. filled with micro-transactions, not enjoyable like the pc games.....bad bad",1
it's impossible to win without spending real-world money.,1
just like the old game. love it. wish I could play on my computer though....,5
this is really close to the original computer game...so happy I found it!!,5
The game aint nothing like the real one so yal better focus on that,1
The only prob I have is how long it takes to load at start but its better than other similar games Ive played,4
The green gems are too hard to get. maybe video rewards offering 1 or 2?,3
great game 10/10,5
Modern DK is just as great as the old game! Soooo happy i found this.,5
As someone from awhile back who played the old Dungeon Keeper Games and after playing more of the game... it is just a cash grab that ruins the series microtransactions so bad that it is unplayable don't get this game... get war for the overworld on pc instead it is closer to the game we know and love,1
"While moderately sorta entertaining, NOT the experience of the original game. Very much pay to advance. :-( the good news is it has made me hunt the original for the PC or try one of its decendants. Why is it soooo hard to find a truly entertaining not pay to win for a phone game?",2
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,5
00.o,5
Pretty sweet almost just like the old school PC version keep up the good work,5
If your looking for the original game. Thus isn't it. They want you to pay money to do anything that will progress you through the game,3
"This game has no shame in manipulating the player and hiding aspects that are pu nishing to even the most thorough, but the premise is unique enough for it to stand out from other idle mobile games. I would give the game a 5 star rating but I hate wall bombs and cheap immortal wins, so it gets a 1 star instead.",1
"tons of fun, but so hard to lvl up! Definitely a challenge.",5
Ok,5
Fun and adventure the way it should be with a bit of dark humor üëπ muhahaha,5
Cute little homage to the classic game. Wish it had the dialog from the original,3
"Try it, it'll creep on you.",5
Nice game,5
Die hard fan of DK since the beginning. The gameplay and style is definitely different but still keeps the essence of The Dungeon Keeper.,5
It's good till you put your name in the it stops working,3
"Too Slow. I want to play a game. Most of this game is not playing a game. Unless you are rich and have stupid money to pay for microtransactions, it is unplayable. Good concept though.",1
This is an amazing game. Unfortunately in their quest to make everything about money and nothing about quality it falls short. Too much reliance on gems which you get with money. Yes you can get some through gameplay but not enough quick enough. Way to ruin another franchise.,1
"I hate this and I hate you, this is a disgrace to the old dungeon keeper games which were perfect in every way, I had hope, and you people stomped on my heart.",1
Loved old PC game. this one is ok,4
Had it for cpu it's awesome,5
"Honestly, this game would be so much better with a title screen so you could log on to a different account from there. Otherwise, great game",4
Micro transaction hot garbage. Don't touch with a 100ft pole,1
Awesome game and I recommend you get it,5
As a player of the original dungeon keeper games i was expecting a lot more from this than having to wait on upgrades and such,1
It needs a way to earn gems,3
This is the absolute worst game by nothing but money grubbing EA. Don't waste ur time unless u r willing to Shell out hundred of dollars. Because if u don't u are going to get attacked and destroyed by people that do oh and don't try to fix ur dungeon up because u will just get destroyed while u r in the process by someone much higher than u,1
"Meh, it's alright.",3
Yeet,5
Fun game a little like the O.G.,5
"Well... Brings back memories i would recommend checking out Dungeon village lite @EA to give you a idea how DK was... Only difference is dungeon village was a village and not a underground dungeon, i would if i was you (but i am not EA) too extend players map as well have humans and elves as well dwarves and halflings (as NPC Adventures get stronger with in a time limit) raid players dungeons and a campaign mode would be nice as well (Whip them players to build their dungeons) give players something to do besides jacking off to The Mistress Lol jk but thanks for the updated look of Dk ""if only Bullfrog did not drop out""",5
When it comes to name your dungeon.... it says the game failed and has stopped working...this is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING! I remember growing up playing this on PC...so PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE....I've Uninstaller and redownloaded it to see if that would help....but NOPE,1
EA pls stop ruining amazing games,1
Don't bother installing this it's microtransactions to its worst conclusion,1
"It has its bugs from time to time, but it's a great game. Just wish they would fix the purchasing issue on Amazon fire devices.",5
Haha Haha the demons inside us all,5
Learn how to play and then plunder away.,5
Takes too long to do anything. 2 hours to dig 1 stone tile... dirt tiles are quick to dig though. Descent game other than that so far.,3
I played the PC version back in the day and this is just as great,5
Sometimes it steals my money when I'm raiding enemies,3
Hated it,1
"Need more permissions to start building before fighting, but love the game always have. üòé",4
Cash grab unless you have days to wait,1
"Yes, there are micro transaction (like most mobile games), and yes they do speed things along. But no, they're not necessary to play, and enjoy the game. If you're looking for a fun game to kill a few minutes here and there, Dungeon Keeper serves that purpose. The mechanics are interesting, and enjoyable. I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a shot. I get it, it's cool to hate EA, they've ruined a lot of franchises, but this game is still pretty neat.",1
Don't like it won't let me log in to my Google account,1
Good game,4
Good game,4
Don't know if other people are having a problem with updates like I am (I'm always having to update) but other then that great game. I loved playing the game on the PC. It's really fun and addictive.,5
"Just like the old school dungeon keeper game, except worse. In every possible way. Ridiculous MTX costs that block your access to critical pieces in the game and awkward battle/raid/quest system. Probably the worst update of a legacy game I have ever played. Seriously just bad.",1
B.S get kicked out of game in the middle of building and the game keeps crashing.,2
Definitely hate pay to play games it's all over Android I don't get it that's why games on phones won't go anywhere I can't just make regular games,1
"At first I was confused about all the micro transactions then I was like, oh EA made this lol",2
So many pay walls,1
This is the spit in the face of every Dungeon Keeper fan on the face of the planet this game should be taken down and should be deleted from everywhere and should no longer be allowed to be published.,1
nice game,5
"When it works it's great. But when you get attacked, lose resources, try to attach to get some back, this opening yourself back up, then lag out 5x, restart your phone, and you've been attacked again, so you try to attach again and open yourself up for attack and you lag out again and never get to make an attack because apparently 4g isn't fast enough... Edit: lagged at the end of a raid. Replay says 100% damage. 3 stars. Defeat with 0 resources gained. Seriously?",2
"I like the original better, you know, where you could follow your creatures around your dungeon and you didn't need money or have wait times....",4
I had this game way back when it first came out.,5
Could even play the game I had it installed about a year ago and now when I try to open the app it keeps having to reload or says no connection,1
It's pay-to-play unless you have near limitless patience.,2
"Completely set up to make you pay to do anything after a certain point in game. 2 hours to mine out a single block or pay 14 gems to rush it ( which cost real money to purchase more of), want to upgrade it will be 200000+ resources, which you can mine only so many an hour or Purchase using gems!!!!!. Want more minions but them with gems, want to get things done in a reasonable amount of time, but the things with gems. A trend use the gems for everything and pay ea all the money's you earn.",1
It's so much fun I just don't like that if you don't finish the Tutorial in one go you have to start from the beginning of the Tutorial.,5
Impossible to like a game if you cannot get past loading screen to actually play it.,1
Loved the original but don't really like it that people can destroy your stuff. People have lives and jobs. Again loved the original.,3
"Dont even start, cause very soon U will end up with wait times like 5days to upgrade anything. In app purchases are too expensive relative to what U can spent it on. And the worst thing is that this all glitches.",1
Its the chesse and the humiliation I like.,5
"I may not be able to try the original due to tech limitations, but I trust this version stays pretty faithful to what was cool about it back then.",5
"""These shards are very rare. Use your shards now to speed up production of these units that will die instantly and this building you'll use once.""",1
It's a really fun game to customize your own dungeon and progress through ranks,5
A shamelessly over-monetized insult to the Dungeon Keeper legacy.,1
Love it so far,5
I loved Dungeon Keeper when it came out on PC years ago and now I have it in the palm of my hand! So happy.,5
Was hoping for a game more like the classic dungeon keeper. This is More like a tower defense/clash of clans game. I honestly enjoy it,5
"Wrong game. Clash of Clans clone using Dungeon Keeper universe. Microtransactions or suffer. Also, devs cheated to inflate Google Play rating: give less than 5 stars (in game) and instead of Google Play you will be forwarded to email developer",1
It keeps me occupied. Which with me is quite hard to do. Especially over extended periods of time. Its not so much a time killer but a wonderful concept for a game. It challenges you to think creatively amd strategically. Not many games offer that while also being fun. 5 stars in all areas.,5
It's fun.,4
Great game play,5
Pay for more play. All upgrades are timed and bypassed with mtx. Complete slap in the face for dungeon keeper fans. Bullfrog did not deserve this. Much better games than this over produced money grab.,1
It's a good games,4
I love it when horny says I'm the keeper,5
Want a game where cheating is the norm and people could not have spent real money buying gems because that would bankrupt them? Look no further EA has the game for you. Want in-app purchases that cripple game play unless you get them to compete with the cheaters? Look no further then EA games.,1
Nice,5
Oldschool but Sadly u reach a point that you are force to buy gems in other to do stuff advance etc etc...,1
tROUBLE cONNECTING tO sERVER..,4
Good version of an old school PC title.,4
Crashes when backgrounded. Doesn't save after completing or starting task in opening tutorial. Will not continue playing after seeing these issues so early into the game.,1
What is my goal? It lacks direction other than build for no reason. No narrative at all. It is dull.,1
Awesome!,5
Liked it on pc great on phone,5
Awesome,5
Lacks a 99¬¢ purchase option. The load screen between things is kind of slow. Great puns and play on words. 6/3 would play again.,4
Pretty fun like the old one but updated,5
Cool,5
I had the original PC game and I loved that game....so far this game captures the spirit of the original.....awesome!!!,5
"Fun game, can get a little impatient at time because of how long it takes to build stuff and I don't like buying gems to make things go faster for everything LOL otherwise pretty good game if you have patience",4
"It's so heavy handed with the microtransactions just in the first 5 minutes, it's insane.",1
Love this gameüòéüòé,5
Pretty cool,5
I LOVE IT,5
Old school fun,5
Reminds me of the game from long ago,5
"Crappy new games me me realize how much I missed playing this one, so I'm black",5
Love it,5
Love it just wish there were more options and characters,5
"Fun until you reach a point in the game where you are matched with opponents you have no chance of beating unless you make in app purchases. You are basically forced to conquer opponents weaker than yourself to survive, but that's all you're doing at this point surviving while never accumulating enough gold or stone to advance. I will probably uninstall this.",2
"I'm updating my review. This game should be retitled Cash Grab Dungeon. Aside from an error every time I try to log in, i spent several days mining rock for gems to purchase another imp. The fourth imp was on sale for 720 gems. Each square only yielded 3 gems, and took 2 hours to dig, so you can imagine how long that took. The MOMENT (literally the moment, I logged out with 10 minutes left to mine 6 gems and i already had 716) I saved up the 720 gems, the sale was over and the imp went up to 1200 gems. That's how they try and get you to buy gems. I was thinking of buying a gem package to support the game, and purchase my fifth imp and get my sixth one as the free one, but dirty tricks like this turned me off to the game. Instead of me buying a gem package, I've uninstalled this app.",1
Great tribute to the original on PC loved it then love it now this game will never get old. Simply amazing,5
All my nostalgia.,5
Way to go on destroying a good game,1
Hey I got an idea let's take an old game that everyone loved and let's cram it full of predatory in app purchases that'll make it better,1
It bogs down after a while if you are a free to play player. Otherwise a good time,3
un game to pass loose time.,4
"I've been playing for year, on and off. What kills my drive to play are the 
updates. They bloat the game which causes lagging and problems with 
starting. Updates should be made to overwrite existing files to control 
bloat and program bugs. Ever since the last update I've struggled with 
logging into the game. I get a black screen that does nothing, just sits 
there. I've even waited for over 5 minutes to see if it'll start loading 
with no result. I've tried to log in at least 40 times today with nothing 
but a black screen. I've restarted my tablet numerous times with no login. 
I'm not sure what types of updates were done, but I am sure it hasn't made 
game play better on my end. Can these issues be resolved? Will my complaint 
be addressed? Or will I just stop playing again?",4
Pretty cool,5
I love this game very fun,5
"Pretty good dungeon game from EA. Something different. Worth a try if you 
are bored.",4
So awesome,5
"Connection has significantly improved. Game play still the same. Game on 
Keepers.....",5
Fix the problems,2
Good time killer and fun to play,5
Wish we could shut the music off.,2
Great game.,5
"Big fan of the original. Nice redux. Wish I could micromanage but this is 
okay too. Happy to roll with it as is.",5
"I like it a lot it just needs more customization and an endless wave 
survival mode to replay daily, just for fun andna few gems",4
Fav,5
Love the game but too much focus on spending gems,4
"Very fun! No problems thus far. Love building, defending, upgrading, and 
attacking. A game I've been looking for for a while.",5
hellishly awesome,5
"This has to be one of THE WORST games I have ever played. It's nothing like 
the original Dungeon Keeper. Not only does it take literally a day to mine 
out a single block but the game consistently shoves it in your face that 
you can pay to speed up the process. EA tries its best to make you give 
them money but as long as you're smart you won't have to give then any. 
Save up $10 and go buy the original DK.",1
This good for talking ur time and killing it,4
"This is nothing like the original Dungeon Keeper games. It plays like a pay 
to win clash of clans game. I don't recommend playing this. There are 
other, better games out there",1
Decent,4
"Honestly, people criticize this game for its ""terrible pay-to-win"" policy 
with its gems for speedups and such, but honestly, what game isn't? The 
game is fair in my opinion and doesn't force you to do anything. Sure some 
things take a few hours later on but when you're working at a job most of 
the time those hours fly by. And while the gems do make it easier and all, 
you can still obtain them through events and such, and I never felt like I 
actually needed to buy stuff to win, unlike games like clash of clans or 
lords mobile where I ALWAYS felt like I needed to pay to win. Take it for 
what it's worth, but for a legit dungeon making game, I think it's great 
fun!",5
who likes the 1996 version of dungeon keeper! good! because this isn't that. that being said if i take the game as what it is... its a decent monster vs land game. but i cant say i like it because of the title itself. it made a concept  that it would be like the old dungeon keeper games... and was not.,3
Yus,5
"Loved the old computer games and love that I found this app. So happy that 
it didn't fall short of what I wanted. ahh missed smacking my imps.",5
So pay to win.,1
THIS GAME HAS TOO MUCH MICRO TRANSACTIONS. GREEDY EA,1
"Best game ever no need to by things and adding a test your own dungin buton 
was smart",5
I love it I've played the Origanal dk games and this does then justice,5
It's a wonderful game,5
Ruined a good IP,1
Yeeet,5
Newer version of DK but loved it. Brings back memories,5
Love a game where you can be the bad guy.,5
"This game is so awesome, love the darkness of it :) the deviousness is cool 
and the sentences that Horny says are funny haha :)",5
"Great game. But its not loading pass the main screen now. Shouldn't have to 
uninstall and reinstall just to play every single time.",3
Great game,5
Fun and dark,5
Loved computer version this one not so much,2
It is as I remembered computer version. Funny and entertaining.,5
"Typical city builder. Only you spend all these resources building up 
defenses only to have your opponent knock a hole in the wall and walk right 
past them. This is NOT DK of old.",1
"Keeps stopping during game, lags alot.",2
"I forgot to update my review of this game years ago, so I'm sorry if my 
previous positive feedback mislead people. But i can't possibly support 
this game. EA took a franchise that I loved and filled it with time locks 
and agregious microtransactions that were intentionally designed to suck 
your wallet dry for the sake of turning a profit. I'm not okay with this 
design and I'm not okay with this game.",1
"If you are playing this because you are a fan of the original DK don't 
waste your time! This is nothing like that!",3
THIS IS NOT A GAME! JUST A PAY = WIN GAME!,1
Fun,5
Great game! Very fun and addictive,5
"There's not enough to do without paying, and even if I were to do that, 
paying substantial amounts of money ($100) wouldn't make the game more 
playable for more than a day or two. Like most FTP games, it's fun for a 
day or two, then it breaks due to arbitrary wait times built to bleed you 
of money. Moreover, combat favors zerging, so defense (the whole point of 
the dungeon) is moot if someone hucks 40 mobs at you. Of course, if you 
pay, you can build a decent defense, but without paying it will take 
months, literally.",1
A perfect example of EA making pay to win games,2
"Requires WiFi, can't keep a server running for anything, microtransaction 
filled. Typical for money grubbing EA, where they can't even imagine making 
a game that can be played offline anymore.",1
"I'd give it a five star if there wasn't so much trying to get you to spend 
money.",4
Personally I loved it,5
"Its so fun you can raid other people and take their items and you can build 
your own dungeon bigger and bigger people can also raid you but you can 
summon minions and build traps to defend your dungeon.",5
I love it,5
Wow.,5
"I loved the old DK on the pc, so happy i found this game again. Looking 
forward to updates :))))",5
Love it and hope more games look like this,5
Great App!,4
It's fun I love Tower Defense games. that's what this one pretty much is,5
"Loved this game when it was on pc back in the day. ..happy to see its still 
fun and challenging",4
Cool,5
Good,5
Best game if u don't like it I hate u,5
Nostalgia/10,5
So glad its back!!,5
"Used to like this game until I tried it again and it's nothing but 
microtransactions now. EA turned a decent game into a turd sandwich",1
Much fun.,5
I like it so far,5
Love this game,5
"It's an okay game to start off with get old really fast their help 
department is really of no help at all",2
Very good time killer wish i had the original 2 dungeon keepers,5
Trash,1
Cool,5
I use to play this on PC and I love it,5
Fun Love the notifications,5
Reminds me of the 90s when I begged my parents for Dungeon Keeper 2.,5
Pay to win,1
100 over 100 very good game app.,5
Played both comp versions 1 and 2 and gold. Love this game.,5
The insistence on using gems at the beginning made me uninstall the game.,1
Wish I could do more,4
Love it! Used to play on PC and found it for my phoneüòçA++,5
Slow and a micro-transaction hell,4
"Game is great but you can't start a new dungeon over so don't mess up or 
your stuck with the consequences later",2
"I love this game and horny you are the best immortal. The flames of hell 
burst forth in fiery glory to honey you my grate demon.",5
"I loved this game, then my kindle messed up and i had to erase everything 
on it. When I went to reinstall this game, it magically disappeared from 
the amazon store along with all the time and money I put into it. Support 
is non existent as I contacted them many times with no answer trying to get 
help with transferring my account to my phone. It's a fun game just don't 
waste real money on it because you'll never get help from support. Quite 
honestly i advise not playing it at all because no one is ever online. It's 
easier to play when you're part of a guild and building goes faster but 
like I said no one is ever on",1
"They do not have sufficient servers. The game is great when you can get 
connected, but that connection is a major obstacle.",3
"Horrible game. Filled to the brim with microtransactions, and not enjoyable 
at all. Disgusting.",1
"Updated review; Going on 3 days now; the game is stuck on the ""Checking for 
Update"" screen. I have attempted to sign in at least 4-5 times per day. I 
have terminated any processes and restarted, ran RAM optimizers, nothing 
helps. My App Manager shows no processes relating to DK running ( no hidden 
either ) , yet if you exit it says "" Download in Progress"" . This is 
unacceptable PERIOD. let alone from a company of the size of EA.",3
Not as good as the originals,3
Â•ΩÁé©Â∞±ÊòØÂ•ΩËä±Êó∂Èó¥,5
"It'd be better if the wait times weren't so long and you could spawn imps 
for gold the same way you summon other creatures...",4
Great game,4
Error Code 7 comes up far more often than successful connections. This code means that EA's tech people are incompetent and unable to maintain a usable server.,1
Made me very nostalgic,4
Destroy the other realms! Killing enemy's really gets Horny hard!,5
Good is dumb,1
"Love this game. I was addicted to the PC version and am so excited that 
they have an android app of it.",5
Woot!,5
Great time killer and homage to the original,5
PAY TO WINüí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞,1
"Lately the app hangs ""Checking for Updates"".",3
Yes,5
"This is the most anti consumer product I have seen in a long time!! The pay 
to win wall that EA has constructed is so massive it should be called the 
8th wonder of the world; as in I wonder who but Eltronic Arts would think 
this is okay??",1
"A. Constant crashes when it's not even on screen. B. They turned it into a 
cheap clone of Clash of Clans, but with grubbier monetization.",1
"Some things wrong with this app. Does not show it was down loaded in 
googple play had start reinstall to leave this post. Keep crashing saying 
contection issues which is not the case. Keep receiving message that the 
app crashed and had to force close when not playing all day.",1
"I... I can't even describe how awful this game is... Okay. I have some 
very, very simple instructions for you. I want you, to watch these three 
videos, in order. If you don't have much time, then just watch the first 
and third. Okay? If you don't have any time, then just watch them when you 
have at least 20 minutes. Just type these into youtube. Nerd¬≥ plays dungeon 
keeper Nerd¬≥ plays dungeon keeper - part 2 Nerd¬≥ 101 - Dungeon keeper 
(mobile)",1
"Hands down one of my favorite pc games, then I saw it for the phone and 
couldn't be more excited. This game is definitely holding true to the 
originals for pc",5
"I enjoy the game, a little strategic. Fun and casual game.",5
Good design,5
Stop spamming review requests. Now you got one.,1
"I enjoy the game. However the support is none existent. I had purchased a 
small amount of gems that included a free imp. The gems never appeared and 
I never got the imp. I submitted three support tickets and have never heard 
back from them.",3
You can play without paying... But game play is so slow.,3
"Am upset that I only got one attack and then it says can't connect to 
server and am sitting right by the WiFi and all my other games have no 
problem with connection",1
"I'm SOOOO happy they fixed the update! Never playing a different game 
again!!! üòÅü§£ü§óüòÉüò≥üòÅ",5
"I dislike that it's somewhat of a pay to win game, but I've always enjoyed 
the dungeon keeper games. But I do love it.",5
"Needs a better way to earn gems but really brought forth my child good 
nasatalga and I'm really liking it . Not too data heavy they upgraded the 
graphics of the sprites from the 1998 version but kept the game kinda the 
same",4
"Could have been an amazing trip down nostalgia lane, however, it's a 
gem-fueled pay wall at every turn...shameless money grab. Save your time 
and your money and spend it elsewhere.",1
Greate,5
It's fun!,5
Awesome great game to pass time love the graphics,5
"Does not handle spotty internet connections well. You have to be 100% 
connected at all times. Literally impossible to make it past intro as it 
resets your progress.",1
Greatest,5
"This is a fairly good game except the long wait times between building 
anything. Imps which you only get one free can only do one task at a time. 
Something that would make the game better is a queue system for building. 
Also more imps.",4
Great game,5
Good way to pass the time.,5
"Buggy but still some charm of the original title. Economics are very geared 
for pay to play. All it's missing is a overpriced dlc that doesn't work",3
"Pretty cool remake of a classic game. I do miss mining for resources the 
classic game way, but whatever. This is still a fun mobile game.",5
"A lot like Clash of Clans, funny commentary from your ""friendly"" demon 
guide keeps it light.",5
I like it so far,4
"Had a lot of fun. Loved the original more, but this phone one still is 
great.",5
Best game ever,5
Its hellafun,5
Almost as good as the pc version. Took awhile to figure things out.,4
"Takes me back, but with micro transactions : /",5
"Like game, Spent $ on another account, but, BLUETOOTH HAS ERRORS. IT SKIPS, 
kept installed for months, but, DEVS FAIL TO FIX. üîúDEAL BREAKER!üîô FIX IT‚ö† 
IM SICK OF WAOTONG AS OF, ITS JUST TAKING UP SPACE AND IS USELESS.",3
"Includes an achievement called ""no documents necessary"" for recruiting imps 
who are basically slaves that you slap to make work harder. Racist trash.",1
"Fun game,awesome graphics",5
"Game is fairly decent but a big drawback is paying to advance and doing 
anything in a timely manner.gems take forever to get and of course you need 
them most.",4
Teribal game. takes 24 hours to mine a block and pay to play completly,1
"Terrible. Just terrible. This is not Dungeon Keeper. This is a hideous, 
twisted visage in a funhouse mirror that mocks Dungeon Keeper. Shameful. 
Disgusting. Posdibly the most egregious cash grab in gaming history. It 
really is that bad. Stay away. Turn around and run as fast as you can.",1
Too much wait on build times,4
"Pay to play, which is a shame because this would otherwise be a great game. They also removed the torture chamber as to not offend millennials.",1
"I would rate the over all game play higher, but it takes real money to get 
anything accomplished, and not to mention the lack of imps (unless of 
course you buy them), good way to pass time, but not something to dedicate 
serious gameplay to; unless you have money to spend.....",3
It OK,5
Can there be angry penguins,5
I feel like God,5
I love horny!!!,5
"As a player of the original Dungeon Keeper series for PC, this is disappointing. It takes months to get your dungeon started and once you get to Gold League you will rarely win unless you pay. The game becomes so unbalanced you cannot defend against flying creatures. Your dungeon will be come a farm. I understand they should have an edge but it is way too unbalanced. This is a huge mistake. I don't want DK on mobile! I would rather pay one time $29.99 than $100s for gems to win.",1
Love it,5
"Takes a while to  build up your dungeon with only two Imps, unless you buy more, but fun game for the patient.",4
Played it on PC have tried to find it and found this love it,5
It's a money maker wait for hours to play. No one should have to spend money to continue to play the game. I suggest save your real life money go on steam and buy war for the over world. It's basicly this game without needing to be fueld by micro transaction to keep playing the game,1
Brings back memories of the computer game from back in the day. I find it better than clash of clans. Definitely good for using down time.,5
Way too pay to win oriented,1
Love it! Smack smack.üòÇ,5
EPPPPIC SOOOOOO COOOL! I LOVE IT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!,5
"Uninstal now, EA you think this is funny? No, got this just for the review. THE END!",1
"Let's start with the bad: this is *not* the old Bullfrog PC game. Having said that, this does have a lot of the old game's flavor and humor and it really fun to play. You build up your dungeon, attract and train minions, defend your dungeon heart from enemy keepers, and pillage other keepers' dungeons.",5
How could you ruin a perfect opportunity?,1
to much pay to progress,5
Woo woo,5
Needs two be up granted,3
Good,5
Hate EA what they did,1
Disappointing in comparison to the PC originals. It's extremely limiting in comparison and makes you wait to play the game as a means of leveling the playing field of it's competetive aspect. But I just wanted to excavate and build a dungeon #sadface,3
Brings me back to DK2. I missed this game. Glad I found you on mobile,5
Play it,5
Keep them coming this game is great,5
"I got this game thing it was right up my alley, but instead all I got was a money sink never get anything maid or owned by EA.",1
Just like old times.,4
Good time had by all,5
Fun and addicting,5
"Faithfully captures the PC experience, with enough of a twist to keep the game fresh and engaging. Love it, giving five stars.",5
Sucks.....well I don't like it,5
"Talk about ridiculous...there is no way to play this game without constant purchases... Unless you consider... Build a door and then wait 12 hours to be ""playing"". Greedy greedy greedy. What a shame.",2
"Spend too much time or too much money. Typical EA. No, thanks. Uninstalling.",1
Not even close to the original. Are you kidding me? I would of paid $20 for a port of even the 1st one. You ruined it EA!,1
Best game ever,5
"I remember playing the original SO on PC when I was young. Of course this game isn't a 100% replica, but this version is still very fun. Graphics/gameplay are great. It has optional in-app purchases but they're not as expensive as most games. You could greatly enjoy the game without any purchasing.",5
"Pvp is broken, all you do is spam trolls to win. No matter how well you build your traps and pathways the trolls will just destroy everything.",1
Okay I like this game at 1st but now it won't even let me play I go to login andit I finally getting and my game is in reset I have to exit out of the game turn it off sometimes even restart my phone and then start playing again but only for a few minutes and it says disconnected wait why you're inserting your dungeon back in order and it looks a preset are that start overall it was fun at first and I still like it but it's become too much of a hassle,3
Overall good gameplay but at this point the game has so many glitches its become unplayable. My screen is just covered by graphical glitches and prior to that the game would crash every 15 minutes or so. I wanna like this game but I can't even play it.,3
"I love this game but hate the monetization of it. The game purposefully takes forever to build and upgrade your dungeon which forces people who want to progress into paying to have, what should be basic gameplay actions, completed. I know this aspect won't change. My advice to new players is be prepared for a fun but expensive experience (if you want to win a lot), and my advice for the developers is to charge for this game up front, instead of milking your audience for every cent they have.",1
Great game!,5
I like it,5
A kickass tribute to a great game.,5
Back to give it another try. Changes from when I last played have improved. How do I turn off the darn music? It's more annoying than being attacked while 'cave n' is supposed to be active.,1
Love it! Perfect balance!,5
Still playin',4
woohooweeyahoo,5
Its really fun,5
Google Play has messed up....two different accounts for same game,1
Its like Clash of Clans with a different feel to it. Its really fun and I never get bored playing it but waiting 4 hours to dig up some dirt is a little too much EA.,5
Cool,5
"Would have gladly paid money for a port of the beloved classic, absolutely disgusted with the micro transaction cash grab EA has made of it. A prime example of the predatory market that is mobile gaming and why hand held systems are still relevent.",1
I have loved Dungeon Keeper since it first came out years ago. Happy to see it's an app game now.,5
This is a great game,5
"I hate how the standard for mobile games is, ""you can wait increasing times for things to build or you can pay us money!""",1
This game is a lot of fun  when I'm out and about.,5
It's an awesome game but the game constantly crashes while in the background.  I get 3 to 4 game crash notices per day. Even when I'm not using the game.  EDIT: The number of times I get pop ups saying this game has crashed is too much. I like the game but the crash pop ups are out of control.,1
Its entertaining but a far cry from the original. How about we dont use real money or wait days to get anywhere in a game.,3
If you want to play Dungeon Keeper you'll need a computer and the original game because this game and it's microtransaction-filled mess is a disgrace and cancer upon the gaming community. Shame on you EA.,1
Really fun game with dark sense of humour.,4
Loved this game for pc.. Almost like re living my childhood,5
the micro tarncasitons are over pierced and completely unnecessary this is free to play at its worst . and all of that on top of spiting on the original and just making a clash of clans ripoff insted of something meaningful,1
Nostalgia!,5
I would have given it four or even five stars if they didn't want $50 per hundred days for the pro level play. That's a pretty high opinion of a phone game the developer has. You might make more money if you didn't think your game crapped gold from a unicorn.,3
No More EA.,1
It may be pretty good but it can't beat dungeon keeper 2,4
You charge to damn much money!!!!,5
Good game too play,5
Ok lovely game,5
Brings back good times from the og game!!,5
Great dungeon keeper remake. A little heavy on the pay to play.,5
Fun game if you like strategy and actually like to think,5
Brings back memories awesome,5
CAN'T CONNECT TO THE SERVER,1
Transactions are WAY overpriced would rather pay to play the original,2
,4
I've always wanted to play this game again now on Android  can play on phone or Tablet  I'm excited,5
Awesome,5
Much like the original. Fantastic game!,5
Love it,5
Its fun and dope,5
"Fun, simple, and addictive.",5
"I've only been playing a few days but so far I like it..it really will depend on if this is a pay to play game, I hate it when big spenders win just because they have allot of money and no skill",4
Amazing game,5
"Not fun if you don't pay, all the pay to play people attack daily at a force that takes away all your gains",4
Entertainment at a time killer level,3
"I was physically unable to go past the tutorial. Every time I get to the end, the app crashes and then I am set back to the beginning.",1
,5
Great game reminds me of the old PC version just simplified,5
Decent....worth keeping i guessüòï,4
It's sooooooo addicting!!!!,5
I can't get enough of this game,5
Not fun without spending money  and is nothing  like  the  original  but  other  than  that  it's ok,3
Horrible game. Beginners have all their resources taken by advanced players unless you pay to win.,1
It is a good game withoit having all the pay to do anything in it or having to wait literally 7 hours just to remove on plot of the dungeon to put somwthing down. Good at first then just gets tedious and annoying. Plus its made by EA so they live up to their pay to win reputation,3
It's nothing like the original dungeon keeper,1
Helps ease the craving for the PC version.,4
Epic,5
"I absolutely love games that give you the chance to be evil instead of good, for they hold a special place in my heart, but dungeon keeper is one of my favorites. Though I wish I had money just to buy something in game so I can throw it at you wonderfully evil people.",5
Cool game,5
I miss being the Imp,5
So far I love it. Literally everything about it.,5
Warning! Very addictive! Very well done,5
"I do really like the game. So I recently came back to the game, one of the things I wanted to see was a worthwhile daily reward. I do see that a daily reward was added. But seriously 1 gem a day? Unless you decide to add easier was to upgrade I have a real hard time justifying spending money on the game. I really wish you would realize that EA' s greed isn't a worthwhile business model",4
Great game addicting. Saves game if deleted so you get your game where you left off,5
Thanks Kris for showing me this game I,5
"I used to play DK2 on PC, this isn't the same thing, but it is a load of fun.",5
I still own the PC version when r u going to put it on games like Xbox an ps versions,5
Its a cartoony remagining of ea and bullfrogs classic game so let the flames of hell burn in your name keeper,5
It's really fun,5
Loved this game on computer love it on my phone,5
A wonderful time killer! Great mechanics and guild play!,5
Like the game play and style.it can get glitchy sometimes,5
Good,5
Promised me in game items for signing up for certain promotions and never delivered. Submitted three help tickets and never got resolved or even responded to. Not trustworthy.,1
"Takes too much real time, and real money. Could be better for people who don't have time and money. Seems unfair, one objective at a time (could be hours) per imp (max 6). You get 1 imp free, and buy the rest... give your bank account up and this is a really good game",1
A more humorous alternative to other strategy games.,5
I'm so addicted to this,5
Much like clash of clans... Disappointed it's not free range like the classic,3
Addicting,5
Yay,5
"This is nothing like the original game.  As many have mentioned, some blocks take 24 hours to dig out.  Some rooms take 14 days to upgrade.  Imps, which are needed, are in short supply and cost too many gems.  Gems are overpriced as well.  The fourth imp would cost $10 alone, if I were willing to pay.  I'd much rather pay $5-$10 for the game then attempt to play the wait fest.",1
Can't get past the load screen,1
"3. years passed,I still can not connect the game server .",1
"Love how unique the style, gameplay and controls are.",5
"Lame, by the real PC version for a couple dollars. Suck one EA.",1
Really fun build your own tower defense game,5
I like it,5
It's fun and funny,4
It's amazing just the graphics  aren't the best,5
"Can't Can't do anything without some popup asking to speed things up for money, or buying gold that can then be stolen from you by other players.  Endless ways for EA to hold out their hands for your money.",1
The British Advertising Standards Authority ruled this game has so many micro-transactions it can not be called free-to-play. lol,1
Great,5
"The tablet version leaves a lot to be desired. The original pc game was a masterpiece,  I wouldn't waste my time on this one",1
Loads of fun what a smashing good time,5
Well fun game. But you gotta spend so much money its like battlefront 2 come on EA,3
Blatant cash grab.,1
Keep the dungeon safe,4
This game has so much to offer and it is not a pay to win game,5
"Epic classic reborn, love the art!",5
"Please add a option to use gold to buy back everything lost in the last battle. Well it has been three years, never fixed that lol.",5
Don't download this please! The game is long so you can cash in for speed! EA is forcing you to buy microtransactions by testing you patience!,1
Nice,5
Not as fun as the old pc game,5
Addictive. Helps sate that nostalgic desire to play DK2.,5
Awsome baby,5
Awesome,5
Love love love it,5
"Pay-to-win hell. Wait hours to do anything or PAY.  And the PvP matching system is just preposterous. You get plundered by player with 10 times your flight time, and basically you just have to wait some more to be able to build anything. That is, if you don't get plundered again till then.",2
Dungeon Keeper!!!!!,5
Better than the classic.,5
Reminds me of the CD rom game only wish it wasn't pay to win,4
I love it,5
"Worst ""remake"" ever produced. Everything fun about the original has been replaced by microtransactions and bs grinding. Not fun at all, none of the charm of the original. Just awful",1
This actually made it to Game informer as the most outrageous microtransactions...,2
Amusing to play,4
And to great game like dnd. Brings back old memories definitely a good game that gives instructions as you go from the demon 2 thumbs up!!!!!,5
It good,3
"Micro transactions are expensive BS. Original DK with FP battles was better. Let me pay $20 once for a full game, not this teaspoon of the ocean BS. Central game premise, design, humor, and tone are all still 100% tbh. If you like this mobile version then I highly recommend seeking out the original Dungeon Keeper PC game for a more fulfilling experience.",4
"It has the overlay of DK, but it lacks a lot of what made DK great.  This is basically just a tower defence game.  The only real DK part is slapping your  imps,  which it doesn't even refer to as slapping.",3
Pay to play.   Intrusive data collection and they added more data collection from when I started.  Don't trust EA!,1
It's a cool game but I just wish it was more like it's original PC version,3
"So far better than anticipated, but I'm waiting for EAs greed. This was based on the Nerdcubed reviews Dungeon Keepers.",2
I keep coming back to this game and hopeing for a big update to bring it back other then the over priced money grab i honestly liked the idea of the game much more then other games like it. I like the ability to create a maze.,3
I think it would be a good game played on console with Overlord an some more characters Kings and knight's just a thought,4
Its nice looking,5
"Honestly, there is no community here. After leveling my dungeon for month and a half, I'm still getting kicked around by higher level players with one flying unit a majority on the time.  Progress has stopped due to my resources being stolen every 8 hours, and when I can upgrade anything, it cripples that rooms defenses for days until done. Even my honest review here I feel is going to be unnoticed among hundreds of paid reviews all saying the exact same thing that this game is addictive and patting EA on the back for knocking it out of the park. I feel like I've had my time wasted, any actual money spent feels more scammed than anything, and being asked for an opinion that will be ignored is infuriating.",1
We want dungeon keepers 3... not this game where you have to pay to win and  takes hours to do something. I wish bullfrog was still around... EA seemed to have ruined this amazing franchise,1
Damn this game really know how to make have fun,5
I remember playing this on the PC when it first came out love this game,5
"Absolutely great game, the wait times are not long at all, although I'm not too far into the game. Making your base and thinking up which ways your opponent will come through is so much fun. 10/10 game",5
Good job ruining a classic,1
So kool,5
So fun!!!,5
"Fun, but a bit heavy on buy buy buy more.",4
Even after years and many updates the build times for those unwilling to pay extra are far too long,1
"This game is funny, addictive, clean looking, fast, not pay to win, and very self aware. Really a great game, my only concern is that I don't know how long it will be until I run out of stuff for my dungeon and it gets boring",5
"Oh the memories!  I used to stay up late smacking the imps around on the old pc version. So glad that DK is back in my life!!!!  I change my mind.  Having played the game for a week, I realize that this is only nominally similar to its progenitor.  The wait times and gem costs are so exorbitant as to make the game nearly worthless.  Death by micropurchase.",1
It is awesome to play a game where the player is the bad guy ‚ò∫,5
This just isn't as fun as the original game on PC.,2
Great game üéÆ,5
Grate game,5
Like it like the old game,5
"This is an insult to the original game.  I have never seen a more greedy and disgusting abuse of micro transactions.  Flee from this game, the only things devilish about it are the developers and publisher.  Still the worst... Updated for current version.",1
"Great game, nostalgic classic. Must try",5
Cool game.,5
"EA buys up so many killer game companies like Westwood Studios, Bullfrog Studios 3D Realms etc. And then proceeds to neuter everything unique and cozy about them for the sake of some mass appeal madness crapshow to make them another twin tower sized bag of cash. Command And Conquer and Dungeon Keeper 2 were some of the coolest RTS and fantasy type games I ever played, and enjoyed replaying. I came hoping for DK2 or a close game but of course this is yet another freemium greedfest. No thanks EA. Sad to think the REAL DK2 cost far less to play FOREVER IN FULL than this POS ""free"" game costs to play ON A #$^%ING CELL PHONE!!",1
Pretty close to the original,5
I've loved this game since it first came out. Excellent setup on android!,5
Dungeonkeeper? More like microtransaction simulator yet another money trap by EA,1
It is nothing like the one on the computer but it is a great game I think the graphics could be doubled in comparison and I think that my Redman is a little bit corny when it comes to looks and I don't like that he has the ring in his nose but it still works out it's a decent game.,5
Such a slap in the face to my childhood classic. EA should be ashamed how they destroy great concepts with greed.,1
Thanks EA for yet again murdering a series I held dear to my heart. You people are the worst thing to happen to the gaming industry.,1
You have NO idea how excited I was to stumble upon this game and then how VERY VERY disappointed I was to see what it was like. I would much rather pay for the app than to play it like this. Imps cost too much you have to wait forever to progress. It's stupid. I LOVED the old dungeon keeper game!! I'd love to play it again but NOT like this.... very disappointing from an original fans view. Uninstalled.,1
Make imps cheaper plz,4
Wish  that getting  minions was a bit easier and that it didn't 5take so long to build up stuff,3
Crazy awesome I've played this game before and it was awesome the space for this game is worth it so you should get this game,5
It's Clash of Clans underground in a dungeon.. Same concept and gameplay but different enough to be it's own game and not a Complete clone. If you like Clash of Clans and similar games then you should try this game out.,5
So cool,5
Awesome,5
Wouldn't  install after download!,1
I think its good all around,5
It way to wait on hours fun,5
Super fun,4
Player well,5
"Don't stop here, keep the dungeon keeper franchise coming!!",5
Im Evil hahahahaha,5
Great,5
Its cool,5
I think the game is great! Sure you gotta fork over a few bucks for an imp and a few more for the others. but the achievements help with the gems to do that. I do however have an issue with the friends section. I've tried countless times to invite friends who are interested of this game and play with me on my Facebook but your button for it doesnt work and I dont think using my gmail for things that go unchecked and would be marked spam would be very useful a quick update to fix this button so I can see the progress me and my friends are doing would help me rate this with a full 5 stars other then that I have no complains.,3
Fun game,5
Awesome,5
Fun game.,5
fun game that brings back memories of the pc version.,5
So far a great game love it,5
It crashes ALL THE TIME,1
"Dungeon Keeper by Electronic Arts for Android Devices... stratedgy game plays great and offers hours of fun. If Android had a AAA Quality  RATINGS playlist on Google Play Store, this would be one of the games listed.  It is not pay to win, if you play smart. I'm suprised EA didn't ask a charge price to download. The modeling of Android games will most likely go through changes sometime in the future. So many people now own some sort of smart device, it seems to me these old models will need to be restructured eventually.",4
Awesome game,5
U are so greedy EA.  It's not enough you gut Bullfrog.  You have to spit on the memory of the series just to extract some extra revenue.  Disgusting.,1
This game is awesome its so fun and challenging.üòç,5
It's cool mask more gaems like this,5
It's really great a good replacement for a very similar game for the pc,5
"If you want the real successor to the old Bullfrog DK games, go on Steam and download War for the Overworld.  This pay-to-play fiasco is pointless and has none of the charm of DK1 and 2.",1
It is nothing like the original. Sresly. Microtrasactions this iss terrable and a whole day to destroy one block terrable do not download,1
One of the Classics,5
Cash grab 101,1
"Lots of fun, love the characters and concept, only downside is that there does not seem to be as many active players as there may have been in the past, ive bounced around to several guilds and they all have a large chunk of members that havent logged in for quite a while.",4
You are constantly attacked by higher level players as you wait for long upgrades! Campaign needs lots of improvement with better rewards.  No significant update in a while=dead game?,1
Fun but it get expensive,4
It was alright. Time killer,5
It's all around a good game,5
Love this game already! It really filled the void I had from a very specific type of game play and graphics I couldn't quite put my finger on.,5
"Gameplay is tedious, to do anything it's tap, wait, wait wait, wait, wait, Literally 8 hours later, tap, wait wait wait... seriously, the 2+ hour dig times and 8+ hour build times ate painful.  The PvP seems super unbalanced too... im routinely losing all my resources to pkayers who are clearly much higher level, there is literally no way to defend against that.   So, overall,  meh.",2
It's ok but I prefer the original,3
"As an old school DK fan, I've come to enjoy the new twists to my favorite PC game. Still fun. Still entertaining. And I'm still spending my time playing.",4
So sad.,1
"Fun and addictive. Make sure you have a stable connection though, because one tiny blip during a battle and you lose as though you withdrew early. Fix that = 5 stars.",4
AWESOME!!!,4
"Fun and addictive, pretty good value for ""freemium"" game. Yeah, life is easier if you pay money for gems but can do fine without (it is a business guys! it's either pay for gems or loads of ads!)",5
Addictive and just the management game I was looking for!,5
"Even if in a general sense this game has almost nothing to do with the Original Dungeon Keeper game It's still an interesting game to waste a few minutes per day on.  one of the biggest issue this game has is really how slow the progress are when you are a new players with only two imps that work for you.  At the very least once you have gathered enough gems , cleared most of the field and recruited a few additional Imps the fun actually begin and you will be able to face the several challenges and players made dungeons that the game has to offers.",3
It's ok but it forces you tj use gems and you need to buy them and ok I get you need a profit ea  but it could have been a 1 time buy and solved it but yea it's a hoorible game to the dungeon keeper name but take this as constructive criticism ea,3
A cool awsome game.,5
Okay,4
Serious pay to win.,1
"This game was fun at first, but then the game takes so long to upgrade rooms and imps are too hard to get, and even though it says I have a cave in to keep other players from raiding me so I can get the 200k of rock to upgrade whatever room it is and I keep getting raided and loose my rock. It's taken days to get that far and then it just gets wiped out. Not to mention the game play is nothing like the original, its player vs player which is fine if you want that, but I was looking for single player against the Heros, warriors and faeries.  So congratulations you got $10 from me in an attempt to make what I thought was going to be a great throwback to my teen years, but it did little to rekindle my joy for killing those would-be do-gooders.",1
Great and Very Addictive,5
A fun passtime. Especially Horny's commentary.,5
Miss offline play and sandbox play from the first two dungeon keeper games.,4
Almost dungeon keeper...,5
still have the original cdrom for my laptop ..i like the oldschool better--,5
Great time killer,5
Awesome,5
Simple fee2pay garage.,1
A wonderful game,5
Nice,5
Classical,5
Big fan excellent strategy game,5
Lots of fun... Can do without spending real money,4
I like this game sooooo much,5
Fun and interesting,5
magmaw is bs cause you cannot unsummon or make minions stop attacking. it forced me to end the raid cause we were locked.,1
Overall a fun game. Similar to the original Dungeon keeper PC game I played back in '98 with some fun modern changes. My only complaint is that you can't move the dungeon heart. And where are the Heros that we can slaughter? The original game you could kill heros too. But I haven't played all the aspects of the game yet...,4
It's like I remember from the old computer game. You can find gems in game so no need to buy them. But can use gems to get more gold and stone to unlock faster . Graphics are great and runs smooth on Note 8.,5
Love it still even after all this time,5
"Every time I tried to open the app if forced me to wait for a 53.12 mb update to download, then timed out trying to connect to the server. Uninstalled without ever getting to play it.",1
Damn the list of permissions was creepy.  Basically wants access to everything from the calender to the body sensors. Nope.,1
Fun recasting of one of my all-time favorite old PC games,5
Super fun,5
"Great dungeon game I'd like it better if there was a way to store items for when you redesign. I'll give y'all a 5 star rating when this feature gets added, which it probably won't. Since I've noticed this game hasn't been updated in almost a year.",3
2 Words. Hell Yes!,5
Like it,5
Great game but mwbye add a edit tool or somthing to remake your base much more simple,5
"I love this game!!! Played it awhile bacc. Gonna download it again. Great job guys, Keep it up! :)",5
I cannot download the DK rap. Help me and I'll 5 star,2
Yay,5
not what I expected from previous dk games.. but still fun,4
I like everything about this game but the name horny is just super weird,4
Pay to pay,1
It's good to be bad,5
Good game,5
Played this on the computer. Glad to see it back.,5
This game is awesome even if you do or don't believe‚Äã in God or any gods,5
"Reminiscent of the old PC version. Not the same, mind you, but it can be fun. Patience is a must, unless you plan on spending cash to speed things up. Earning gems seems to be easy enough so far, The third imp(construction worker) costs 800 gems, should earn that within a week. Unfortunately raiding other players is the quickest and easiest way to get gold and stone. Mining takes way too long in the beginning. Try to be thrifty because the minions you use to raid with are gone after they're summoned even if they win/survive the raid. Hope that review helps.",4
Really good game. Fun to play and encourages you to get creative. Plus absolutely love the HR character.,5
Its a good game for all the hate it gets id play ut way more than i would another game like clash royal,5
Love the graphics,5
They ruined a classic with in app purchases,1
Get dungeoned keeper üòàüëøüëπüíÄüëªüëΩüë¶üë¶üë¶üí©üëæüòÄ,5
Would Give it 5 stars if I could play but it keeps saying error code 7 then it shuts Down every time,5
"Not bad, for a reboot of a legendary rts.",4
Update: gane has changed slightly but it now proves to be an enormous resource hog even on a galaxy s6.  Had to uninstall because of how badly it would bog my phone down even when the game was closed,4
A great game! The only flaw is that when I go to zoom in or out it will occasionally confuse that and tell a minion to start digging. If you would add a zoom in/out button then the controls would be perfect!,5
"I love the voice of horny, which is just funny to say, he reminds me of Tim curry",5
Loved it,5
Great for passing the time.,5
this is a good game h9wever I think the PvP needs to be tweaked a bit so you are matched with people of your skill level,4
Nice game,5
A lot of changes from the original but I'm game... I'll never spend more than say five dollars on it but hey,4
It's fun!,5
MICRO TRANSACTION HELL 24 HOURS TO DIG OUT 1 SQUARE OR 5 BUCKS U.S.,1
"Inconvient loading screens, otherwise great",4
Id like less micro transactions and more game play i have gave up playing this game because it has changed from the original pc game id like who ever made this to be fired please and for a full game to be released on origin i know and you know u would make plenty of sales on pc if this is done please make this possible,3
Great game,5
I loved the original. And I've played this off and on for yrs,5
They stole my money,1
Fun game,5
Dis game is awesome,5
It's a fun game,5
Good very competent for a mobile game best kind of building game I've found in awhile,5
It reminds me of the pc version,5
"I love the subtle humor and the random tidbits of funny stuff, I've always got to be ready to laugh when I play this game. And who wouldn't want minions who LIKE to be slapped around? Keep up the humor, Horny!",5
Game worked great for the longest time now it just wants to lock up and keep in a loop,5
Terrible example of dungeon builder.  Cash farm for EA is all this is.,1
"Horribly unstable - keeps crashing during raids costing me minions, mana and wins. Since dungeon building is painfully slow and campaign adventures boring, no facet of this game can maintain interest for long.",2
Wickedly wonderful for those twisted enough to play it.  Suprisingly adictive and relatively cheap as these games go.,5
it is not 100% great but enjoyable,4
I missed this game a lot. Thanks EA :),5
A good spin on an old favourite of mine. It could do with a push more towards the original in terms of gameplay.,5
THIS A PIS TAKE,1
"Awful, money grabbing phone port. Just buy the original on GoG and play for many, many hours.",1
Recalling the original version for the computer. Has a lot of the qualities I miss.,4
I think the game is awsome to play and fun too,5
I've couldn't believe it. You've actually brought back one of my favorite computer games and put it on my tablet. Totally can't wait to see what the new Mistress looks like!!!,5
"Just read up on the history of this game. They have done horrendous things with this ""f2p"" game.",1
The don't work but still is awesome,5
Cool,5
"Tower defense classic. A staple of the genre, but now it is everywhere i could want to play it.",5
Bff in,5
Awesomeness!!!,5
I wanted to design dungeons and line them with traps. Expanding is restrictive and way too slow. This is just another time vs money financial model protected by such games as clash of clans.,1
It had a lot of potential early on but late game has been slow and underwhelming. Even though they improved dig times it still doesn't feel like enough I spent the better part of a month just clearing the 4 hour blocks and nothing else. Still I find there to be enough interest in the dungeon building and the strategic raiding to hold my interest.  For a clash of clans styled mobile game it's very solid. It's also easy on your battery which is always a plus in my book.,3
I cannot even get on the game it says it cant connect deleting this now. Im really disappointed i loved this game on pc years ago  was looking forward to playing,1
"I think I'm going to be sick... This is not a game. And I'm sorry for the ones who thinks it's a good one, you play a game for it's game play and story, not to give all your money to a money hungry company. If you want a good game get the ones for PC, and I'm sorry for people that haves phones as their first thing to game on, I have yet to find a good game on a phone, so please if your thinking about getting into gaming please get a computer (steam is the good game distributor). (And thanks if you read this far, now please have a good rest of your day)",1
I am christain,1
Awesome game,5
Fun game but imbalanced. Someone from dread league attacking Bronze and is 14 levels above? BS. Only reason some of these guys are winning is they have triple the manpower I'm capable of at this level.,3
Close to the old game but not the same,3
Cool,5
"Old school, brings me back to my roots...",5
"Long time fan of DK, this one is built around microtransactions, but is still fun without spending anything.",5
"Game reloads/kicks you out whenever someone attacks you, even if your in your own battle. It's done it twice to me in the last few minutes. Game is starting to become a waste of time since you can't get anywhere.",2
Its a awesome game that i play a lot in my free time,5
Love it,5
"Fun at first, but quickly turns into a boring treadmill grind, on par with most Free to play apps. Good controls. Combat is unbalanced.",3
Mwahhaha,4
Love it,5
God,5
Good game,5
P2W,3
"Just started, but this is different, lots of fun so far. To cool...",4
So many good memories of the genre. Closest will ever get to DK2,5
This game is ok. Not near as good as the original. Really annoying pop up asks if you want to install dungeon keeper ringtones....you say yes and it doesn't and it keeps asking everytime it loads,4
Absolutely love the original pc dungeon keeper and was excited about this one.  I still think the original is better but this is still a great game.,4
"The absolute worst mobile game in existence. There's absolutely no game-play to it and you have to shell out real money to accomplish ANYTHING, which still doesn't let you have fun. EA should be ashamed of themselves.",1
i love this game because satan talks to you all throughout the game and gives you updates on the things you are building..very sinister but jovial game,5
I enjoy it,4
10 out of 10,5
Dungeon keeping at your own pace. Self test of dungeon is a plus.,5
Great game!,5
Dungeon  Games R Awsome!,5
Pretty great,4
I love how similar to the real game this app is,4
Great job to the builders,5
Cool game! I remember the computer version and find this as enjoyable if not more 'cause now I can keep when I want!!,5
"Exceptional, reminds me of dungeon keeper from pc.",5
Reminds me of the original game.,5
"Another dumb freemium game, pay out your ass if you want to be good at it",1
Almost as good as the original.,5
Not a complicated game.,4
Just like the original !!!,5
Thanks for this attacking an d building game,5
Pay to win or make some progress,2
"Don't waste your time, unless you want to fork over tons of cash this game is all about waiting, I would pay for a game without microtransactions and constantly having to wait unless you pay money, and I wouldn't mind waiting if we were talking minutes and not days. I wish people would stop feeding games like this so they would starve and die. Big fan of the originals btw. Plenty of games on the play store that are way better and you only have to pay once.",1
This is so far from what dungeon keeper should be. It's just another click and wait with a new skin. It constantly begs you to pay for premium as is par for EA.,2
Awesome game...hours of epic fun,5
It's cool,5
Like it a lot played original keeper on pc back in the day and think they did a decent job of making it a tower d like phone app game I would like a few things like the possession spell fe9m old game but all n all a good fun game also though unless ya wanna pay to play it can take some time to get your dungeon to be pimp something I don't like but did keep me coming back,5
Fun game too bad the recent update makes it crash so much ya can't play it at all on my Galaxy 3. Dungeon level matching  still needs work in PvP.,2
Very enjoyable!!! Love it!!!,5
A fun and addictive game,5
Overall  it's a really good game,5
A  fulfilling port of the original.,5
Awesome,5
"For a strategy game i have found that this is greatly enjoyable, and addicting. I keep coming back for more. The controls are simple and easy to learn. The graphics, while cartoonish are detailed and well done. Like many others of it's like, once you get far into it things start taking a long time to complete. This game is child and family friendly. It takes a short time to learn how to play and is easy to get into. The community is also quite friendly with a few exceptions as with any online community.",5
Good time waster,4
I played the pc original and I wish yours also allowed for more integration with the characters. Good job still I like your game...,4
Really digging this game,5
"Been playing for couple years already and its very hard game to advance unless you spend money, defending your Dungeon against the computer, high level players and cheaters attacking your dungeon makes it very hard too.  Very unfair and unbalanced attacking is a problem.  Also 3 minutes is not enough for the attack time, make it 5 minutes.  AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND NOT SEEN ANY ACTION FROM EA I'M UNINSTALLING.",1
THIS IS REALLYYYYY FUNNNNNNNN,5
Nice,5
Cool,4
It was great I mean awesome,5
Freemium,1
Keep bringing me new horniee audio and I'm in for Life.   Thanks,5
I want to restart but it won't let me :'( PLEASE FIX IT DEVELOPER,3
I miss some of the features from Dungeon Keeper 2 on PC but this is a pretty dang good version for Android but it would be nice to be able to pick up characters slap individual characters and possess individual characters to go on missions,5
"This is a perfect example of how you take a great game and destroy it. If the developers think that aggressive IAP and long wait times are the way to get people to play, then they are sadly mistaken. Upgrading rooms and building at first is fun, but then it will force you to wait days before you can do anything, or pay just to play. I hear the updates made things worse by deleting some of your hard work and minions... Just ultra bad.",1
Very cool,5
Fun game,5
In my opinion this game is pretty fun The graphics are good and the amount of buildings is endless,5
"Always been a dk fan, great game. Build times get a little long at higher levels though.",5
Its good.,4
"Addictive, fun, quality fee to play game.",4
I think that this game still has some improvements that need to be made such as the slow crawl that the game becomes the further you get into it. This can be avoided but not without spending real money which I find to be a problem. With all that being said I do still have this game downloaded and thoroughly enjoy the game.,4
Addicted,5
Just started but I am enjoying it so far. Good game and definitely recommend trying it out.,4
bad as heck,5
How can you destroy dungeon keeper game and make in to this garbage its so bad in every possible way so disappointed in this. Shame.,1
Like it,4
This game is fun,5
Addictive and devilishly fun,5
Was pretty good earlier.  Recent updates make its networking stack so fragile it is unplayable on mobile network.,3
Its fun,5
F- I couldn't log in to game,1
A sweet game my minions will get you heheheheh,4
Get this game.,5
Overall super fun...would much rather have paid 60 bucks for it to have unlimited play than the micro transactions though.,4
"Game has potential. Unfortunately, the devs are money mongering ass holes. Right from the start it's all lies, and only about money. - You are promised that upon completion of the tutorial, you will receive back any gems spent during the process (gems, btw, cost money). But it's a lie. I contacted support and even told them i would give a one star review if i did not receive my gems. - So here i am a well later, still no gems. After some research, this seems to be common practice. They claim its a bug (from like 3 years ago, that happens to everyone). Sad, because i like this game, but i will not play it because of this.",1
Just Plain Awesome! Very good balance. Who doesn't love the dark side? LoL,5
Edit Mode Needed,5
Very fun and I can play just fine without using üí∞,5
You have completely destroyed a classic to much pop-up text turned it into a microtransaction clickfest and made it a complete pos.  You have completely taken away it's gritty charm. It's a shame that you ruined something enjoyable. I know EA needs to make profit but for once they should have released the game close to what it was when Bullfrog Entertainment was around. Dungeon Keeper 2 ftw.,2
Great game.,5
Good game,4
Love,5
Cool but they should make it a little less nerdy,5
FREEMIUM.  This is not even close to the old Dungeon Keeper which was an outstanding game.  It starves you for resources in order to to get you to spend $$$.  If you try to play for free you will be repeatedly trounced by players using $ until you cannot even reset the traps that they pay to go around‚ò†- uninstalling.  And EA needs to stop being so greedy,1
Good game.,4
Multiplayer version of my favorite of game.,5
Would like to see an instruction manual on playing the game,4
Never felt so good being evil,5
It is nothing like the old dungeon keeper for pc wich would be okay if it wasn't so relent on micro transactions to do anything after a while,2
"Perfect blend of nostalgia and new gameplay. Great job, guys :)",5
Love the game but it keeps glitching out on me when I try to do some of the challenges please fix,5
"Horrible. The original was a million times better. Game play is restricted, and the tutorial is absolutely boring. Game play doesn't get better.",2
"Money grabbing with pretty graphics. Prepare for boredom unless you are rich! EA proves, yet again, that they are all about hooking people with addictive personalities, not actual game value.  Other than the 80 I spent on a game that certainly wasn't anywhere near the value of say, Witcher 3 (50 dollars) I enjoyed it, until I got to the point that it takes LITERALLY DAYS AS IN MORE THAN 24 HOURS TO UPGRADE ANYTHING..?   Gaming on mobile is a huge waste of cash. EA is leading the way proving this truth. I mean seriously, damn....",3
Hard to get into... But fun,4
Lol,5
Meh,3
"Micro transaction heavy, but overall a great game.",4
I love this game,5
Good time killer and it has a few jokes in the game I thought were a little funny.,5
Great game. Reminds me of the original game,5
I'm upset it's a game u have to wait for,3
Awesome just miss the dark angels,5
Quickly addictive and loads of fun.,5
"New to it still, but is very enjoyable.   Will be playing for a while.",5
Sweet,3
Super fun starts a lil slow but still really fun,5
"Fun, not enough games where you truely get to be villainous.",5
Blast from the past ! Yeah baby!,5
"Addictive gameplay with a fun UI makes this app worth getting. However, I still think there needs to be an even larger reduction in dig and upgrade times, along with a reduction in how many gems it costs to purchase imps.",5
It's cool,4
"Pay to play in the worst way. The majority of 5-star ratings are because they bribe players for a top rating. Also, for me it works off Wi-Fi but not on... Which makes no sense. Uninstalling",1
Excellent,5
It's cool u should add a stadium that we can use our immortals and battle 1 on 1,5
"Awesome, yet tierd of pay to play.",5
Better if we could freely dig,4
Fun game but... Crashes constantly and sound is all crackle and annoying,2
This game is for people who like strategy,5
"Nice old school game. It's different from most tower defense games you'll find for mobile,  which is great! Definitely worth trying.",5
Best game ive played for mobile phone this year..,5
"Awesome work,  thanks",5
This is a sad excuse for dungeon keeper as i had pretty high expectations coming from the old pc version this is basically a pay to play game as everything takes forever to build or reinforce and you would want to speed it up but then you run out of gems and then you really just get bored,1
Different like it.,5
Gets stuck at Checking for updates right at the start and never loads! Samsung Note 5,1
"Love it. Sound, look, playability... its all great! Brings back a lot of memories.",5
You can only play online. I love the original dungeon keeper on the computer and downloaded this because it looked similar. This is more like a pay to play game where you battle other people.. If you put in an offline mode and make it more in tune with the original game I'll rate higher,1
Because I like to play Dungeons that's why and Dungeon Keeper is the one best,5
Reminds me the pc dk game.,4
If it didn't demand you pay real money every 7 seconds it would be fun.,1
Like it that's all,4
Just what I Need. The small version.,5
It's pretty good,4
Gooooood Bap,5
Good game so far,5
I loved dungeon keeper as a kid and this game makes me live it all over again,5
"Pushy version of a classic. Having fallen in love with the PC version years back, this is just a rip off all the games similar but far glitchier. Paid gems for premium but took the gems and ignored it. I paid for an imp more to move the reminder, not much help either.",2
Crashes a lot,1
Fun,5
It's a nice rehash of an old favorite,5
Fun,5
Good,5
Really fun dungeon creator with great graphics.,5
Excellent game with updates often. I would love to see a part 2,5
Fell far from The Mark with ridiculous microtransactions,1
Good game but looks like it will cost a bit more,5
It fun,5
It's all I ever wanted. ;-;,5
I was expecting the original not some bullshit cash grab.,1
This game cheats by redirecting people that would give the game a low rating here. In cheating against this cheat.,1
"Great game, I used to love the old PC versions, and this nearly lives up to them as an app.",5
Is a very fun game. Very addictive,5
Awesome game,5
Is fun,5
Pay to progress.  Ridiculous wait game is unplayable without spending tons of money,1
Love the game. Needs a tad more violence.  Gore effects or something.,4
Wish it was a bit less cartoony.,5
Great game needs improvement on lagging,5
"So far, so fun. Miss the old school DK but this is a nice fix so far and no problems loading or crashing as of yet. üíû",4
"LOVE the game, however, the game force closes/crashes on me every two minutes.  That wouldn't be a problem, because I like the game so much, but I have to wait through a 1 - 2 minute loading screen everytime.  Sometimes in force closes/crashes before that is even done.  Fix the crashing or get it to happen less and I will rate it 5 stars for sure.  Other than that, AWESOME game!",3
Intriguing concept,5
"I used a new email to reset progress and I can't. Good game, needs feature.",4
This is one sick f'in  game.,5
"The Dungeon Keeper developers have a great sense of humor. This is a fun PVP Tower Defense twist on the old RTS Dungeon Keeper series. No ads, but it does use every ounce of devilish charm to promote it's pay options.",4
Awesome!,5
"Fun game, very addictive!",5
Buggy but fun to play,3
"Decent game, wish it was a bit more faithful to the original. Good time waster though, entertaining enough to keep playing for months.",5
Demon Boom,5
Ok so far,3
It is amazing,5
Again the pay to play at a normal pace is unfortunate.,3
It's a great game,4
Good stuff,4
Overall the game is pretty decent so far with a few exceptions. The first is how long the building upgrade timers are so early in the game. I just downloaded the game 2 days ago and already ugs take 6+ hours at the least. Second is having to resummon troops after every attack even if they all survive. If you have troops that survived the attack why should we have to summon them again shouldn't we just keep them? Other then those 2 problems id likely get 4.5/5 stars,3
Awesome,5
"I would score it a little higher, but I haven't been able to play it for a week now, it says its checking for updates, and then nothing. Might just delete it if I can't play soon. :-(",3
I'd rather be tortured by the mistress than play this.,1
"I just love it thank you for bringing it back!,",5
"I keep getting an ""app has stopped working"" message even after i closed the app and using other apps. So annoying",1
Similar to the pc version but funnier,5
Seems to have a problem actually shuting off after i close the app.,4
"Boring, stupid and not like original.",1
The only downside is it randomly load in mid game and freeze my tablet,4
Huge paywall,2
"Fun game, i missed this game on pc so I had to get it when I found the Mobil version",5
Very fun strategic game,5
Dark delicious fun,5
I think this game is garbage.  It has literally nothing in common with the earlier iterations of the series.  This game is nothing more than a blatant can grab using the Dungeon Keeper name.  It's boring.  Plain and simple.  I can't even bring myself to do any raids anymore because of how stupid raiding is.  Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this garbage.,1
It is great,4
Really fun,4
Could use a little work to polish it.,3
Easy to play and is very funny!,4
"Very disappointed I continually get code 15... I have a G10 and no other apps give me any issues. Uninstalled 3 times, restarted my phone, and kept trying over 3 days. Will update score if problem is fixed.",2
Fun game. Similar to the classics,5
An awesome take on a childhood classic game,4
It's dungeon keeper time!,5
Joining friends is way too overcomplicated,4
Need more lamp,5
Deadly fun game!,5
Times a-waisting...  lol,5
Very cool.  Tower defense combined with building of Sims. Nice and addictive.,5
Glad you brought this game back loved the PC version.,5
"Focus on digging, buy imps on sale only. 5 stars, but game crashes often, slapping imps often source of crash. Server disconnect issue unresolved.",5
"Glad  to see Dungeon Keeper making a come back. I loved that game then, I live it now",5
Bad customer service.,2
A lot like the old game anyone who played also loved.,5
Good game,4
Too buggy to play.,1
"Great game, throw back to the PC days.",5
Great game,4
A wonderful return to an old school delight. Just miss being the imp and digging myself,5
"In spite of improved play mechanics, every update creates new issues. Frequent lockups and blank menus. Common hiccups in connection to server causes lots of games where you loose by being disconnected in the middle of a fight. Also 51% damage win becomes 49% fail due to inconsistant server accounting -1 star. Hey EA, requiring server contact in the middle of a fight is foolish and buggy. Tired of constant ""wait while your imps get your dugeon in order"". Play anything by Supercell instead.",2
Gives ya that DK fix.,5
Clunky on an s7 with strong wifi connection. Just your usually money an time suck that most mobile games are with a bit of inspiration from a classic. Avoid unless you like mindless tapping.,1
Frivolous and Fun!  Easy to play and great graphics!  A must have game for killing time!!!,5
Great game!,5
Just love it!,5
"Take a deep breath. Stop trying to envision this as the old pc game. Think of it as where keepers practice rumble to entertain themselves. I can see how the waits get on people's nerves, but. Mobile game. It's meant to be a time killer. Not an epic saga. I liked it for what it is.",4
Keeps losing connection with server,4
Everything Mythic touches is gold.  Bring back Warhammer Online!  Bring back DAoC.  Fanboy forever!!!  ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,5
Played on pc so glade its on my phone now,5
I loved the computer game and I love the app game! It's a good download especially if you like build and defend type games. Thanks for the great game!,5
Everything about this game is great I love dungeon crawlers and games like clash of clans but this game is kind of both,5
I like the original should not have made this one multiplayer,2
Good game but fragile networking code makes it unplayable on spotty networks like mobile.,3
,5
It is so cool,5
Love it,5
Fun and easy to play!,5
Tarnishing a fantastic franchise with b.s.,1
Played the very first one and i loved it im starting to love this o e too,5
Everything is good,5
Problem with gem purchase.  I purchased the 4.99 (500 gems). AT&T show purchase was made but the game did not. Please fix.,5
LOVED IT,5
"It really brings me back memories of the original Dungeon Keeper, except this one has really good graphics that I can actually see details on all my imps the rest of my army. Other than that, it is a really good game and it has really good gameplay and controls and I recommend it to all Dungeon Keeper's fans who played the original game.",5
"So good, so far.",4
It's a one of greatest building games I've seen,5
Keep doing what you are doing it's üëå,5
this game was awesome years ago and it's even better now. I'm so happy to be playing it again.,5
Over all this game is fun I just hate the fact that if you want to get anything fast you need to buy gems. Other then at not a bad game,3
This is a disipointment to the actual game dungeon keeper. Everything costs money unless you want to wait a week just to dig certain areas or even freaking reinforce a wall. This game is seriously just a discrace to its original game. Good Job,1
"The game is enjoyable, but the microtransactions make it a little less so. All the free to play stuff is enough to stay interested and helpful however.",4
Amazing throwback game,5
Too many microtransactions.,1
I absolutely LOVE this game!!,5
"I was really stoked when I saw this in the app store. I recently got the original pc version from Origin for free and I absolutely loved it. This had the potential to be that awesome but it just isn't. The clash of clans style nickel and diming gets old and I expected more from this developer, but I get it, you have a living to earn too.",3
Love it one of my favorites,5
Great mobile version of this awesome game!!,5
Good shot,5
"Tower defense gets a fun spin with the return of this delightfully twisted franchise.  It plays like an action puzzle game as you try to Crack the defenses of other player dungeons or conceive of diabolical traps to lay for your own unwelcome guests.   As a bonus, it doesn't have the usual app hang up of daily play required to get ahead, but rather can be played quite casually and still experience the whole game.  All in all, it is a welcome addition to one of my all time favorite game series.",5
I like it.,5
They turned it into on of those freaking waiting game,1
great game love the voice work,5
I love it,5
Great game,5
Had original game on PC few years back and loved it. When I saw this app for phone/tablet my heart jumped a beat. Good call on making new version of this game.,5
"Pretty good game but, hell I have to take a infrequent amount of time to do something",4
Love it! So glad that is classic PC game is now mobile!,5
It's not bad....computer game is a bit better of course.,3
Oh god the memories and feels!,5
"Nice, simple",4
It delivered what i expected out of it. Imp slaps included.,4
"dont rate games often, but this is greaatttt game",5
"I loved the first 2 for PC, so this is awesome",5
Better off getting thr old PC game,4
Best game,5
Cool game,5
My brother and I have been enjoying the game,5
"Loved it up until last week or so when it hangs at 90% , loading minions, and just stays that way.  Fix that and my rating will go up.  Right now it's useless and I'm uninstalling after playing for ages. Sad to say goodbye.",1
Won't connect me to my dungeon. Keeps saying error code 15.,3
Very addictive,5
Great game more to do would be good,5
Ive always loved the pc version,4
As many other reviewers said the imps end up coming short and gems ($) are required together more which suck..But other than that great time killer. Very similar to old   pc game!,4
Reminds me of the old dungeon keeper sucb good memories!,5
Addictive,5
Kts fun but a lot of buggs,3
"I absolutely  loved classic  Dungeon  Keeper, this game is just another crappy pseudo rts game for android. Following  the same formula as others with a DK cloth draped over it.  I tried to love it, but it had nothing  to give in return.",2
Bring back pc version memories,5
"A mere shadow of the glory that was the 1997 release of Dungeon Keeper. This game, if you could call it that, is hampered by its even most basic functions: a pay-to-play wall in every menu, timed mining/construction/summoning, locked in room sizes, and a tiny dungeon map that requires leveling up your dungeon heart to expand a tiny amount. Most disappointing of all is the raiding feature, which caused me to be attacked by a player immediately after finishing the main tutorial. During these raids, the player is locked out of interacting with their dungeon or even watching the event. If you looking for a Dungeon Keeper styled game, play the original, otherwise don't waste your time or money on this soulless cash-grab.",1
"It's pretty fun, bit different from the original, but close enough to still enjoy. Buying gems is a little too pricey for their worth though...",4
"Games not too bad. Graphics are good, a little slow at first but I'm sure you'll be pulverizing in no time.",4
This game is awensome  its easy to control,5
Similar to the pc game. Wish there was a free play part to play for just fun.,5
Don't bother if you're a fan of the original. Freemium nonsense.,1
play one and two on pc this is rilly cool,5
"It is an amazing all around game, u can tell time and effort was used to make it and it is just so addicting",5
It's and amazing game with fun story,5
Loading time is slow and buggy.,5
Greedy devs,3
Decent fun a really good concept. I've been playing it over a year.,5
Amazing,5
Can't transfer my account from Apple to Google. Years wasted after switching to different phone,1
Great,5
"Typical base game like popular Clash of clans. A bit unrefined though. The ranking system is totally borked. There are tiers to leagues but as for ""walls"" from those top players attacking freely any and all players (It picks a random player) they can easily get a player several thousand trophies below themselves. e.x. I am 1400 trophies but was recently attacked by a person who is 8000+ trophies. So heads up to those new players, this game isn't exactly friendly to those who are new. You will take your lumps.",3
Tons of fun.  Better than the original!,4
Over all good game great graphics,5
Why memories,4
S'alrite,4
"Was good until the last android update, after which it became unplayable on some devices. Given the large amount of money that is required to evolve in this game you would have thought EA would immediately sort this problem out and not pass the blame to smartphone makers. Only Dungeon Keeper crashes on my device, which means it's a DK bug, not an android one.",3
I think it's gun and addictive after short time,5
Pretty cool game could go with out dungeon heart being higher level to dig out gold,5
Good take on the genre,5
So far so good,4
Brings back memories!!!!,5
Fun comedy twist on strategy...Reminds me a lot of Overlord series in console gaming.,4
"Surprising but nice to see the name resurrected, even as pay to win.",5
Fun,4
"It was amazing, keep up the great work guy's",5
It's a clash of clans with a dungeon keeper skin. So bleh,2
I love it when it was from Bullfrog and I love it as an app from EA games. It would be fun if they expand some more.,5
Lost me when I realized you lose troops even if they survive the fight.   Game breaking as far as I'm concerned.,2
Always love this game!,5
cool,5
"This game is bad ass, Evil is good and this game is Evil as F***",5
"So similar to the PC version, love it",5
cool,5
One of the best games I have come across.,5
"Over 800 gems, poof gone because there is no 'confirm' step. Accidental yet gone the same, so be careful! But you don't have to pay to play, only whiners would make such a claim.",4
Great fun game that is actually free. Not a mindless clicker.,5
If you played the old Dungeon Keeper games you will most likely hate this game as I do.,1
Ahhhhhmazing,5
Perfect concor game,5
This game is awesome But I wish the Skelton's and stuff weren't just  heads,5
It's clash of clans with slightly better base building. If you're looking for a base building game like the original pc games you will be disappointed. Anything fun about it is hindered and slowed down by pay walls.,2
"Cool game, graphics and sound good. Just getting started.",5
"The production quality of the game is high, but it takes too much time to build things and the sheer amount of money required to make the game playable for more than a few minutes is appalling.",2
Been waiting for a new DK since it was a comp game thanks EA.,5
Did not like when they changed the costs of upgrading the main heart with battle points ... Total BS,4
Need easy ways to get more imps,5
Fun and addicting,4
A really good strategy,4
"This game is crap.  This is ""not"" dungeon keeper in any way or form.  Its nothing but your typical generic cut and paste gem grinder like millions of other Clash of Clans clones on here.  Then again it is EA what should I expect.  I only gave it 2 stars because slapping the imp on the loading screen is the most fun part of this game.",2
It's a fun time killer,4
Good little game,4
Awesome Game üôÇ,5
Love it,5
I loved the game to be honest but I've ran in to so many bugs... Most of the time I have  gotten pass them but now I'm having times where it shows like Codding for everything or something so it would normally say loading but then it would change to loading_loading and it's kinda odd..It's not so bad but now I've came across a bug that doesn't let me attack and doesn't let me select any troops at all and the timer is stuck at 99:99 and it makes attacking impossible. I really need them to fix this or I'll be forced to rid of them game out of the Sher point of me not really being able to attack or let me watch replays.. please fix this EA,3
"Not as good as the original  pc games, but it has its charms",4
More ways like watching adds to get gems would be cool,5
"No complaints, love it. Awesome game.",5
great game,5
So far so good. Better with sound on it's hilarious. Not 5* but very cool.,4
Fun dungeon building game!,5
The game is fun addicting but there needs to be an easier way to add friends no one can figure it out if someone could help me out greatly appreciate it I'm on an Android tab Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tab a I've done numerous research on getting the daily rewards with no luck please make it more simpler and I will give you a five star,4
So much fun! Every few months I come back to this game and it's steady and fun.,5
"It's great, raids keep you coming back for more",5
Boring grindfest with too many IAPs,2
I just love this platform and premise. Smoothe graphics as well.,5
Good,4
So nostalgic.  Reminds me of the original back in the day.,5
Game sucks,1
I must admit it got boring after a few days but it was fun,4
"Game's fun so far. It seems you can get jammed up now and then, finding yourself without gold with which to train new creatures, but the tutorial has bailed me out every time thus far in those regards.",4
Very fun. things eventually take too much time to upgrade even the smaller traps.,5
Good game I love dungeon type games like this one,5
"Fun homage to the original DK games, still would love to see graphically updated and tablet optimized versions of DK 1 & 2",5
I like it.,4
DOPE,5
"Excellent revision of the originals, but the price of the gems is much higher than I would have expected so any inexperienced gamer use caution on what you use any gems you may purchase on.",4
Fun Kl Kk K,5
"game allows high level players to attack low level dungeons.  you lose a lot of resources and get attacked again, losing more, before you make back what you lost the first time.  fix that and the game might be fun.  otherwise, expect to pay a lot to even be able to play.",1
It is pretty cool,4
"Reminiscent of Dungeons keeper for pc, with an pay to win system.",4
"Very fun and addicting, have tons of fun Building my dungeon",4
What a great remake of a classic!,5
Audio incredibly choppy on my S7 edge... What's up?,2
This game have allot for itself and i must admit it's very addicting has well,5
Fantastic game,5
"No way to get account back on new device. Can't skip tutorial, can't log out or in, can't log in with Facebook",1
Way cool app!!,5
I love it! Great game!,5
Thank for a great game,5
It's a great time killer if you have a few minutes,5
superb voice acting crappy gameplay,2
Nice.  I like it.,4
Turned  out to be a blast,5
"problems: flying units in a underground tunnel system, this killed it for me right away.  made no sense what so ever. completely removed any reason to make a decent dungeon( at least make them fly threw the tunnels, just make them immune to ground traps.... Immortals are way op an unnecessary, just make them special units like the old games. The amount of micro trans actions is unnerving. Let people pay for imps, custom skins, that kinda thing. Really just underhanded business tactics.   Everything else is somewhat tolerable or even amazing. Graphics 5/5 Humor 5/5 everything except whats been mentioned above 5/5.",2
Awesomeness,5
pretty good game...i like slapping the imps...lmfao!!,4
Pretty much like the PC game I use to love,4
"Another EA pay to win game,  not worth it.",1
"Easy to play,  easy to learn,  fun irrelevant humor.",4
"Well made, unobstrusive transactions that are optional",5
"This game has me waxing nostalgic, very good remake! Highly recommend!",5
I like that you have troops and a base I think it's as good maybe better than clash of clans ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫,5
You need to stop with the thirty updates a day.  All I want to do b is go on a raid and the updates break that part of the game.,5
Nice rebuild on a classic!,4
Fun game,5
I think the game would be great if it didn't crash during raids all the time I'm 2 seconds away from deleting it. Potentially a great game destroyed by ppl not removing the bugs in Ur updates plz fix asap,1
Great fun!,5
Stopped working out of the blue. Nougat.,1
Nice,4
"Last update killed all enjoyment. Also, slapping your imps for a speed boost can break the game, sending it into an infinite unplayable loop. But typical for EA huh?",1
Brings back memories of my childhood.,5
"Since updating my phone to Android 7.0 the game has a very annoying popping sound and it crashes during raids, extremely frequently. Currently unplayable. Can't even do challenges. Before updating my OS it worked fine. Fix this mess!",1
I üíò the game,5
Pretty wicked,5
"This game is nice if it can keep a server connection.  I am dropping this because I cannot keep a connection.  This is stupid, because you miss out on resources and lose money and magic.  It could be great, but it is so frustrating that it is terrible.",2
It's a solid game.,4
"Overall not a bad game. Has the downfall of all such games that are designed around addiction fueled microtransactions... Unless you are paying large amounts of cash to buy their in-game currency to speed things up, it gets slow and boring way too fast. Overall the idea is great, but I would much rather have an android port of the classic Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2. I give it three stars and a solid meh. If I had tons of liquid currency to dump into the game or it were easier to earn gems, it might have been more fun.",3
Like it,5
Awsome,5
"Like original version, but with a catch. Like other games you buy gems to speed stuff up.still fun without spending money, and no extra permissions I think.",4
Interesting.,3
Damn... thats pretty goood,5
Really addictive. Only game I've liked. Makes you think.,5
Would be a perfect game.. but way to may microTrans actions. Just get the old game it's better sadly:(,3
Cool game,5
To much of a push for in game purchases and to much of a wait for some really annoying things,3
Love it,5
"Played this game on PC when I was a kid, loved it then and love it now.  EA.  should remake this game for PC and consoles with online capabilities. Aand.. I'm just throwing this out there but you should add away more rooms and traps and maybe even multiple floors. Oh, and when it comes to the gameplay you should keep old elements of the game like being able to select a creature, zoom in on it and look through its eyes or zoom in on your cursor (which is a demon hand I think) and slap an imp. All for a remake. For as many people there is that play this game, you could probably sell a lot of copies if you do an outstanding job. This mobile app is already really good. Maybe create a separate app that allows you to link with your console or PC version.     I don't know.. I'll shut up now. Lol . Great game!",5
It's really Fun. I like the Jokes and Puns on the game as well.,5
"Hi guys I've just spotted this little gem of a game and I'm really interested in it, as its right up my ally so to say but I've tried to play it 12 or 13 times so far. As well as redownloading it 4 times so far.it starts up just fine I get through the update and then Sam hit with an error code 7 message. Please help in getting the issue fixed as I know of plenty of others that would love the app,and am willing to get them playing as well if you could please get it fixed and working again. So please don't give up on a gem like this one and work on it so that hopefully I'll be able to play on it cause it looks epic,sounds epic, and probably is epic so work hard please. I'm using an Alcatel one touch pixi pulse if that helps any so hurry please as I can't Waite to play it. I'll delete all other games besides coc and oac for this one if it is working lol. Does that tell you how interested I am in this gem of a game? Oh and I'm on the 4.4.2 is if that helps as well. So good luck and work hard please:) P.s also if you could consider making it a offline/online crater as well I'd rate it 30 stars if possible",5
"A flash back.   Love the strategy.  Graphics are simple, but exactly as needed, anything more and they would bog down the game.  Enjoying every minute...",4
"I am SO f**ing sick and tired of always always always getting attacked by those in the game 5-6 Dungeon Hearts ahead of me, I don't pay for games and think that those that DO need to get a life, that being said there needs to be in place some form of game mechanic that keeps the the level 10 and 9 Dungeon Hearts attacking OTHER level 10 and 9 Dungeon Hearts ONLY! I didn't check my game for only a day and was attacked by 3 level 10's and a level 9 Dungeon Heart. I don't even HAVE defenses for dragons (which are only available at level 9 Dungeon Heart by the way)let alone HALF the s**t they throw at me! If you want more stars or a higher rating from me fix it!",1
"It's pay to win all the way. You can't do much with 2 imps and by the time you save up for a 3rd ( 800 gems ) it's too late, raided by people with units that are nowhere near your level. On the plus side the voice work is solid, graphics are good and its easy to use the controls. Free to try, but plan on forking over real cash to move on.",3
Needs to be more like the original,4
Just like old times,5
I love it.so much,5
It's okay,4
"Horrible,  time restraint port of the original.  Very disappointed",1
Needs less buy this and buy that. But I LOVE DUNGEON KEEPER!!!,5
Another EA fail.  Nice till you hit the paywall.  Haven't been this disappointed since SimCity...,1
Pretty good so far still low lvl but liking the game better than clash of clans.,5
Love it wo far. Pretty funny as well,5
The click for the mining is stressful,4
you should be able to delete things,4
I honestly love this game very much... its better than clash of clans IMO,5
Disappointed all around.,2
Another micro transaction nightmare. Stop bastardising games please.,1
Love it. Wanted to play dungeon keeper for so long and lo an behold its here on an app. Muwhahahaha,5
A vary awesome game I hope it gets bigger and better in the future,5
Almost as good as the original,5
Nostalgia Galore,4
GREAT GAME!!!,5
Love it!,5
"I have always loved dungeon keeper, and this version does not disappoint.",5
Addicting and progressive gameplay really fun,5
Hate the PvP would get raided by super high lvls constantly should have option that allows you to not do PvP,2
"If you loved the original game, and/or liked the sequel, do not even bother.",1
"Fun game to play,haven't had any issues with it.",5
Fan of the old school DK and this is a great take on it,5
Good game addictive. Easy to pick up.,5
Not bad so far. ^_^,3
Fun addictave,5
"A great legacy ruined by ""freemuimization""",1
"Kicks you out in the middle of battle ,sometimes, otherwise pretty good.",3
"Amazing! One of the coolest games ever finds new life. Everything it should be, a real homage to the classic games.",5
Awesome,5
"But not for phones. The font is sloppy, and inappropriate for the format  Poor design choice.",1
Alot like the old pc game. Great way to waste some time but another free to play pay to win. My sound is distorted tho.,4
This game is Like waiting for DK 3 this game makes you wait without much reward EA should look into improving this game by reworking a lot of the timers and game play mechanisms. All and all love the DK theme and I am forever waiting for DK 3,1
"Whenever a game allows another player to attack you with a creature and you have no defense against, nor access to. Thats when i delete a game. After youve logged about 4 days, high level players will pummel your dungeon with ghosts that can walk through walls and take out your entire dungeon. I dont want to mindlessly tap and spend on a game, i want a level of some competition where i can feel good that the dungeon i built is doing well.  I dont want a player who has 1000 more medals than me and is using creatures that are 2 dungeon heart levels above me coming into my dungeon and demolishing it with 3 ghosts.",1
Makes me miss the PC version,5
If you liked og dungeon keeper you'll like this. It's like clash of clans with its own feel to it.,4
Great strategy game for killing time good dialog and excellent article easy to control,4
"Oldskool DK fan here.. heard all the negativity so I had to see for myself.. got to say I actually like it. Seems like most of the criticisms are of the f2p model & microtransactions rather than the game itself. Which is  a blast! So you have to wait for stuff... yeah welcome to f2p mobile games, get a life or just play a few others so you aren't left staring at the screen waiting or tempted to buy gems. And for a true successor there's War For The Overworld.. if this didn't carry the DK name it would be rated a high 4, really is a good game in its own right.",5
I like you a lot but you really need to work on the graphics seriously you need to work on the graphics guys and ladies.,5
Poop some,5
Pretty fun,5
"Really EA? Something is wrong with the newest updated. Every time you tap on your imps it keeps reconnecting, and messing up various things in the process. I and many other people willingly SPEND $$$ playing your game. Why wouldn't you want to fix the problem so we keep playing and keep paying?!?! You're beginning to make a money maker an unattractive headache.",1
Fun. .,5
Fun game,5
They turned a masterpiece into a Farmville clone. You cant spell Steal without EA,1
Its like your very own dungeon,5
"As a huge fan of the original series, I was ecstatic when I found this app. And while the strategic game play, the graphics, and the essence of the original is easily recognized in the game play... The game is completely unplayable.   I constantly get the ""server error 15"" message, meaning the server are down (allegedly).   Not only that, but the times I can play are intentionally limited by actions with long, real-time cooldowns... no doubt to sell more cash items to allow you to continue playing.",2
This is so a clash of clan rip off and makes me sick to see an original game turn into a monstrosity of a change alright.the original is way better in opinion...,1
Good,5
Love the game on the PC and love it on my tablet!,5
"Bringing an old school favorite to mobile. Love it! *** update 1-9-17: i made a 19.99 purchase for gems. I never received them. I read the faqs and it said to give it 15 minutes and report it through their in-game support channel if the gems were never received. I did that. 24 hours later with no response i did it again. 48 hours later i registered on the forum and posted my situation. 72 hours later my post has not been cleared for approval to be seen, and i still have no response from EA. I now am going through the motions of getting Google to assist me with a refund. I am so disappointed. ** update 1/14/17: still no response from EA mobile. ** update 1/24/17: my issue was finally resolved and I was given additional compensation for the inconvenience.",4
Alsome game but you need to be able to gather all your traps and sorage to redo your dungeon.,5
The game is awesome,5
I wish u have gem giveway on this game.The game is very great to PLAY all day.5star.  EA SPORTS IS GREATER ALL TIME !!!!!!!,5
"Pairing is completely imbalanced, otherwise a fun strategy game.",5
It's a great game,5
"Simply awesome! Cool graphics, some humor and great gameplay! Loved this game on PC years ago and this one didn't disappoint!",5
Love it please update the game its 2017 this game has potential add more units more campaigns and Buildings and levels for the building consider it as a option,5
"I used to play this game on the computer , A little different in this but it's still fun",5
Very addictive,5
They NEED to make it so you can attack specific players in a world map.  Then the game would be awesome.  Without its not compeditive play... prolly why people likely dont xoin in game that much,4
Love the voices,5
I used to play on pc back in the day makes me feel like a kid again,5
"A faithful representation of the original, but not the original...",3
It's not bad I have it on pc,4
Very good and graphics are nice,5
I LOVE THIS GAME,5
"Loved it years ago and love it now,",5
Loved this game on PC. Thanks for bringing it to mobile.,5
This is the dungeon game you've been waiting for!,5
Love it very similar to the computer game great for an app,5
Brings me back to days I wasted endless hours on DK2 for the PC fifteen years ago.  We never got a DK3 but this is pretty good substitute.,5
I played dungeon keeper on PC. This is not dungeon keeper. Boring af.,1
Wish it was more like the original game,5
I really loved playing this 1st and 2nd one on the pc and this bring back memories what  fun to have this game,5
Emp cost too much,4
"The game is almost the same as the old PC DKeeper. The difference is it has been modified to fit into the ftp market and so you have fewer imps that cost more to purchase and gems are now purchased rather than mined. It's still a good game unless you're one who hates to wait and hates to pay not to wait. I myself like the game, I use it as a sort of meditation on patience, hehe.  Well, after playing for a couple days I see that EA is still the same greedy company as they've always been. They want more than the game is worth.  Very very little can be built with a level 1 dungeon heart. And you can't upgrade the dungeon heart without 4 combat points which you can't (at least I can't) get without spending money.  This is NOT truly ftp. It is a farce, pretending that it is free to play when to play it for real requires a ""premium"" subscription.  Disappointed and uninstalled.",1
Nothing like the pc version. It's only fun the first couple times you level up. Attacks are too frequent to collect resources (that have a very slow regeneration time) which means you can't save to upgrade anything. And none of the techs respond to emails.,2
Not a good remake of the legendary Dungeon Keeper.,1
Old school nostalgia,5
"Good game but gem prices are too high, and imps are too hard too aquire without purchase",4
Good game just started hope it gets bettet,3
Really interesting game,4
It has good things in it but can u guys improve their health of the trolls,5
Brings back memories of the pc game which I still have thank you,5
"I played this game very often. Spent a lot of cash on it almost daily. I signed on one day to find my progress erased. All the money I spent down the tubes. I tried to contact someone to fix the problem to no avail. They sure took my money fast but when I needed a problem fixed, like my whole game erased, could not get an answer. Still haven't heard anything. I would not recommend this game. It's worthless.",1
Great game,5
Great graphics,5
Played DK  all my childhood! This is a great app!,5
"Well Im sad to see they went this low for dungeon Keeper,  id rather Pay $50.00 For a cliche  old versions",1
One of one of the best damn games I played in a long time. And now i re loaded the game after all this time and i still think its kick assss,5
Its great,5
"Games Set up really nicely,",4
"It is not the same as the old PC game, but it is quite amusing nonetheless.",4
It reminds of the good ole days great fun,4
Love it Graphics are good,5
Don't do this much but I loved it by,5
EA can do better in terms of art and innovation. Otherwise a pretty standard Clash of Clan clone,3
So-so game. Not much variety in builds it seems.  Semi-farmville feel to it. Gems to dig faster... not cool. LACK OF FRIENDLY PLAY! Could be more to interact with others. Takes a while to load sometimes. Could remove a few loading screens as well...,3
"I've had this app for 3 years.  After a while the app prevents free play progression.   Gold and rocks are stolen by being continuously attacked by advanced paying players.  There is no way to prevent the relentless attacks while offline as purchased gold and rocks can be stolen as well! This is an expensive pay to progress and win app. Fun at first but eventually is fustrating and expensive.  I loved the old PC version, this update is based on fan based familiarity and greed.",1
I played the original game in the 90s and DK 2 so this was a trip down memory lane. I do wish it was closed to original game but that might be to much to ask.,4
Best game I ever played,5
Decent game not necessarily pay to play. Captures the spirit of the original.,5
"Nice graphics, nice tutorial style, but ridiculous what $$ you want for gems to speed up gameplay. Old PC game was much more fun to play - this - you play a little then u have to wait #$*& xx hours until your room upgrades.üò†",2
It's fun,4
Not as good as pc version but good since you get a lot of gems to start,4
Worthy adaptation,5
I can't explain how good this game is lol just download it I did and now I can't stop playing,5
Fun game only complaint is I ordered gems to get the free imp and still have not received my Gems or my imp so it kind of made me not want to invest any more time into the game. Send a message to support never got feedback on the issue at hand so I'm done and I hope this helps future players,2
"Likin it,  lots of fun",5
They stole my money and havent given me my purchase even way after a support ticket. Not even a response from EA in regards to the ticket. If you ever plan on purchasing dont do it with any EA titles. EA ARE JUST CROOKS!!!!!,1
Paid for two gem packages and did not receive gems. Sent a report to customer support stating the error and still no response after a few days. Ended up having to get my bank involved with getting my money back. Complete rip off do not buy anything from them.,1
The absolute best graphics  üòàüòà,5
It's fun love dungeon keeper 2 more but it's OK also,5
Pretty cool. Easy to loose yourself in.,4
I don't think they're even giving me any Gems or anything to tell you about this game. It's just that good I thought you should know.,5
This was one of my favorite games ever growing up on the 386.  But always connecting to a server is just sad.  Uninstalling.,1
Not as good as the old PC version dk 2,4
This game intentionally makes things slow and annoying to get you to pay money. Also it crashes randomly. Welcome to the mobile game market.  Not fun. Not good. Not enough hate.,1
Good,5
This game is neat.,5
No offline.,1
Nice way to ruin one of the best games ever. You have successfully launched a piece of crap. Congratulations.,1
There is just something about Horny's voice that is delightfully evil.,5
Loved this game ever since it came out.,5
Poor choice EA.  Free to pay. So muck sucking.,1
Love the game. Plays and looks great. However I've paid for gems and have yet to receive them nor have I received my free imp.,3
Just like the good old days!,5
I used to play this game in PC! The characters from the older one I think is better...,5
Nailed it,5
Very addictive awesome game,5
"Made a small gem purchase on 1/8, 8:42a.. still have not received the gems.",1
I like it alot,4
Loved it as possible game and I love it now,5
Cool game,5
Brings me back to the originals,4
In app purchases don't want to work. Support has not been helpful.,1
Problem . locks up on updates,4
Great fun,5
Good  game,5
A great way to pass the time.  You have to be patient while upgrades are in the progress  and dreadstones are needed for the bigger and tougher,5
Addicting,4
"Very upset with this company.  Double charging me.  Not delivering the gems they charged me for.  Not responding to 4 separate messages sent to them. Great game, but absolutely horrible service or response.  Don't appreciate being ripped off.  Contacted my bank today to charge them back.  Scam!!!",1
It's k,2
Its time consuming in a good way. Its much easier if u spend real money. But still possible to play without. Gems can be earned through playing but take a while to build up. I hate tower defense games but i enjoy this one i recommend it.,5
Excellent game guys. :),5
"The game is close to the old pc game, I enjoy being able to play while on the run with my work, progress is pretty easy and you don't have to buy gems to make progress.",5
So far so good i am still learning the game,4
"Was booted during a raid because it lost connection for 20 milliseconds, all the minions are lost during such an event so if you want to raid again you have to spend gems forcing microtransaction this game was far more enjoyable on the pc even without the ""stellar"" graphics offered on the mobile because my play time wasn't portioned out like methadone TRY AGAIN Mythic and EA maybe you guys can try to save battlefront.",2
Fun,5
That's pretty good,5
Was a good idea of a base building game,5
Love dungeon keeper series. Wish there was a better title to play beside a mobile game.,4
Simple as that. I'm on 3g most of the time. With it doing updates something like twice a day... It's not worth waiting forever to play just to have it update again,1
"How about you make it playable on lgspree it WON'T EVEN GET PAST ""CHECKING FOR UPDATES""",1
Play the old school game on pc ...,5
Fun and love the side comments and great graphics,4
Definitely addictive.,4
"An updated version of the old PC game, adapted nicely to phone game format",4
It freezes and reloads almost every 5 seconds when you're trying to enter combat. How can I enjoy it when I can't even play it???,2
"Plenty to do, dont really need to invest a lot",4
"Very similar to the 1st Dungeon Keeper I ever played  on my PC, now I can play it on my phone that makes it awesome, don't agree with all the prices for up grades , but the game is very well put together.",4
Some what like the pc game but not like they could of made it.,5
Great game and it pretty close to the origional PC version.,4
Sure I disliked the Horned Reapers look but this is a really great dungeon building app even though I don't recommend this game for people that don't have that great of patience.,5
Loved dungeon keeper on PC and I'm having a lot of fun with this one!,4
Man I love this  I mean I be we played the classic ones but this is a Rey good game,5
I have been playing this for a while but now with my new Xperia I am having some issues. When playing pvp the game just shuts down. Hope you guys fix it.,3
Fun game but they need to get rid of the Are You Still There screen and let devices sleep.  So annoying to come back to a device that is either hot or has a dead battery for no good reason.,2
The overlay of the game is pretty cool though the raids work weird but whatever I'll still play,4
I had this for pc a while back and loved how it fed my wicked side! THANK YOU for bringing it back and keeping the original voice actor! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,5
Cool game concept but tends to lose progress,3
I think it's neat,5
Awesome fun addictive,5
If you like spending cash for gems then this is the game for you.  What a disgrace to the Dungeon Keeper series! Use gems to get more imps instead of summoning more with your natural magic.,2
"I was a huge fan of the original game this is based on. The game-play is fun and is a good update for the classic, but early on it is very very slow, and takes a long time to upgrade anything. Resources build painfully slowly, and it seems to force you to buy things in order to do anything more than wait.",3
Not to.bad,4
Started out a bit slow.  I am really getting into it though.,4
Waited forever to be able to play on my tablet,5
It would get 5 stars if it wasnt so pay to play,2
Not as awesome as the originals but I'm pretty damn impressed.,4
I love it so much,5
It is fun,5
"Its not bad, but it tries too hard to be like Clash of Clans instead of Dungeon Keeper.  The original was definitely superior but not a bad game.",4
I üíñ game u will to,5
"I just started it, but so far it is very entertaining, and provides fun things to do while waiting for new additions to your dungeon.",5
Love the art,4
Great game to begin with then it's either a long wait or a lot of cash,4
Great port/reimagining of a classic game.,5
"An incomparable opportunity, Keeper. Do not disappoint!",5
"Slow and steady progress, but fun!",5
I played the first Dungeon Keeper W\expansion on PC and this a bit different. You practically have to pay to play this app to fu#k sh't up and that's the reason I rated it 4 Star's. Nothing compares to PC gaming.,4
"This is basically a reboil of ""clash of clans "" and it's ilk. The game seems to be designed to bore you into spending money so that it becomes marginally less boring for a few moments. While having its definite fun bits, advertising it as DK is simply wrong. And, frankly, meh... It isn't nearly awesome enough to wear the DK title.",2
"Fun as heck, love the immortal chat. Great game all around.",5
"Ok, so i have only a couple issues.. Disconnect, but restarting your phone helps,  second issue v.v ... When i set my imps (5 imps) all to dig out hard gem veins (which take 19 hours and 12 mins with guild boosts) useing a 2x efficiency boost (which lasts 9 hours and 36 mins w/5 imps) that should mean that at the end of my efficiency boost that all 5 digs are done with when boost wheres out, yet all the blocks have an hour left & i c ant motivate the imps without disconnecting...",3
"Great time waster, and decently entertaining.",5
Awesome game I love it.,5
This game satisfies the D&D player in me.  Good tutorial and a fun strategic game.,5
Great game.,5
"Great twist on the tower defense genre. I love being able to attack, defend and just test out my dungeon",5
See title,5
"The attempt to recreate an app version of the classic original fails. This, like so many other failed apps, prefer to target specific audiences as cash cows. There is a feeble grasp at the original progression with ""storyline"" quests. Outside that and the similar sounding narrator, this is no different than other exploitative PvP (cr)app$.",2
True to the addictive feeling of the original of game.,5
What more can I say?  Time to play!! üòà,5
Best dungeon Game ever So worth the 5 stars,5
I can't seem to share the game with my friends on fb or Google+ any advice how to make this work?,4
Cool little game.,5
Could use a bit more fine tuning here and there seems too easy in the beginning,4
Good game,4
I still have my old disks of both games for pc from back in the day brings back memories,5
"Like the concept, wish it was a more like the original.",4
It is a fun game but takes time to build things so be patient,5
Not bad...real fan of the original pc version,4
Anyone who has played the original dungeon keeper will apprecoate this app! Great game!,5
fun to play.,5
Are expensive like all games like this not too bad allows for more defensive options than most,4
Says there's a patching problem what is it and how do i fix it,1
Very fun,5
Simple and actually very funny....,4
EA did a good job bringing back a classic that was stuck in the living room. I love the game and how it is the same but different.,5
Oooaaaa,5
Love it great time killer.,5
It's fun but I don't like how high level people can attack you as soon as you start playing.,3
It's has the colourful and cheeky narrative that the name would inspire and some fun dungeon building if not a constrained one. The intention of a reboot is there but it really fell short with really long wait times designed shamelessly to ' encourage' microtransaction purchases. In short time it feels like a reskin or mod to clash of clans.,2
Fun for a laugh and a tablet tapping distraction.,4
I love it good job cuz üòé,5
Fun,5
Love  strategic games,4
Needs to be available for play offline,3
It's amazing,5
"Coming back to this game after like two and a half years, still going strong",5
I am really enjoying this game. I just got the original Dungeon Keeper on my laptop and I can safely say that I greatly enjoy both games.,5
"If you're looking at this because you enjoyed the dungeon keeper games, this isn't for you.  If you're looking for a fun game without those expectations, this does the trick.",4
The   game is great nice graphics,5
Good but too much of the pay to play stuff later,4
Fun,5
"And amazing expirience, but different feel, boy I miss the classic.",5
It's a very good game and it brings back the old classics like Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 but now it's portable and I love it,5
Love DM!!,5
It was not a bad game until I kept getting raided by people with the wall bomb spell which you can't stop.,1
"This version is reminiscent of the classic PC game. However, even if you close the app, it still makes audio notifications. If I could silence those, it would get the 5th star.",4
It's good,4
It wuz kewl,5
Times ten,5
Super fun. Very true to its predecessors,5
"There is  no point to this other than take your money and waste your time.  No fun, no point. Worst.",1
It takes some grinding but its still fun.   Best when u can find a good guild  to join down the road.,5
It is one of favorite because. It reminds me clash of clans.,5
Repetitive,3
I want to marry it,5
Loved this game on pc and i love it here just as much. But for some reason my loading screen messes up and displays weird things and won't load past it. If it weren't for that i would give 5 stars,4
Fun little time waster if you have the patience or are willing to spend money to speed things along.,4
Fun game. I like the whole dungeon concept with resources and buildings. Though I have not proceeded to far into the game. I understand you really have to pay out some cash to beat some levels.,3
Very cool,5
Awesome spin off the original pc version from back in the day. This one has more depth and content but the building and upgrade pace is very slow...tempting you to spend $$ to speed it up. Its still extremely fun. I love the freedom of building your own creepy dungeon.,5
"Players customize their own dungeon, building stratigcly in anticipation of an enemy horde.  Upgrades come at the cost of victory, victory comes at the cost of successfully raiding other players dungeons while defending your own... dungeons are the name of the game. Trick hordes of egotistical baddies upon a weakness, only to show your might. Theatrical explanations aside, the game title says it all if youre looking for a new strategy game, or returning to these dungeons of past.",5
If u do that if pay 5 or 9 dollars for it but when u change it like this it kinda takes away from the DK 2 I remember,1
Very Very VERY fun!,5
Awesome,5
"This game is great, has both active and passive play.",4
"This game was one of my favourite pc games, I'm so happy to have found it in this version",5
"Excellent, no real pay wall. Great for couples, and guild style play.",5
"Game started out great and just went downhill! Once you get to higher levels, it becomes a sucking machine for greedy ea!",1
Very funny and addictive I enjoy playing a lot.,5
Bueno!!!,5
Read the title of this review.,5
Lots of fun .,4
Nice game,5
I love it,5
Like running in to an old buddy...,5
Don't understand all these comments calling the game bad at all.,4
SHITE,1
Not like the other Dungeon Keepers I've played but still challenging.,4
"I love this game!!!!! I played it on pc when i was younger. Thx for the updated cool. But the game times out often. uurhaa so frustrating, not a lot of opportunities to get gems, (feeling like a payapp game to me)üò• But i still love this game. Plz fix plz...",3
"Actually pretty fair game, definitely needs a few changes that would could make the game more balanced.",5
I might play it sometime,1
Still not as good as the computer version.,3
This is good. Wish you could possess like in the original.,4
"The worst installment, of the series; if you want A FUN EXPERIENCE, get the older games, that are available for PC. This ""spin-off"" however, is greedily made. Don't play this poor excuse, of a social game!",1
A poorly made cop-out of a fun series. It's really not that fun to play and the tutorials are annoying. Originals were far better than this.,1
Great game. Still playing DK2 to this day,4
The game is fun,5
this app has to be... THE most interesting and fun game to play!,5
Very lazy freemium cash grab on the dungeon keeper name. You can pay to be stronger...enough said.,2
I like it!,5
"This stinks, spent 30mins waiting for reconnect. Have had issues with zoom gestures and not being able to select anything. Give me single player, with optional multiplayer",1
Awesome thanks,5
Refreshing take on tower defense,5
Nice fun game,5
Love the game so far. Seems to be done fair (I am only level 6) but fun.,4
Super addictive,5
So much like the original!,5
Best game I have ever played in years,5
Either I haven't played enough games of this manner or they didn't explain anything to me in depth... otherwise amazing game! Very fun to command & conquer!,5
Almost like the original,5
Not the original but not bad.,4
Loved this game on PC many years ago. Loving the chance to play again.,5
You need to spend üí∞üí∞üí∞ to get anywhere with this game but still fun and amazing ....brings back fond memories of the classic DK game,4
Cool App,2
Love it!!!!,5
"Fun little game, good time sink, dialogue is amusing, as is lighting other people's minions on fire",5
Loving it!,5
Adorable,5
Title,5
Fun and challenging,5
It tickles my dungeon fancy,5
This game I'm been looking since they made for pc,5
Epic game. Great strategy and a throwback to its original game. Love it and will continue to have it on my phone,5
"This game just saddens me that DK3 never saw the light of day.  Seriously, start a go fund me page and give us the real deal! Until then I will enjoy the very tasty scraps you have provided here",4
It's just that addictive.,5
I always have this game on my phone it's really fun!!!,5
Had this game back on pc in 98 loads of fun,5
Really enjoying it so far.  üòä,4
"Just installed 45 mins ago, and can't pull myself away!",5
You bid a good job on the game,3
"I was a HUGE fan of the DK titles back in the late 90s and this game has a familiar feel to it. Sadly, I could only connect 25% of the time. I kept getting 'cannot connect to server' errors the rest of the times I tried to play.",2
Finally some pvp Dungeon Keeper!,5
I've only been playing for a few days but so far it has been really fun. Easy to follow along and figure out your next moves but still enjoyable and easy to get caught up in the premises and carried away by the story as well. Give it a chance and see if you don't have a good time as well.,5
Just like the old PC game.,5
it will not download,1
Absolutely loved this for the pc... justice has been done...!!!,5
Not a bad game,4
Problem,1
"A pain in the rack, but wickedly fun.",5
Good,4
Without the classic`s first person point of view Im not sure if it will ever make it up to 5* . Thanks for the rebirth though,4
Either than that this is one of the best games I have played so far!,5
is so much fun,5
Upgrading buildings requires you to spend 19 gems or wait an hour. Quests give gems out in 1s and 2s. New workers cost 500 gems. Garbage.,1
Needs a count down timer for cave ins. For 5 stars,4
I love it the great graphics and great game overall. expose 101,5
It like the old one on the pc,5
Most gem thirsty game I've seen. EA when was the last good game you made?,1
Hell yes!! It's good to be evil!,5
I don't like the nick name horny,4
Clash of clans with a D&D feel. Nice concept!,5
"The game has changed. It's fun again, at least in the mid levels.",4
Great game alot of fun. Only issue is after you get farther wait times are to long.,5
I'm hooked! Great game!,5
Love the game used to play on the pc years ago and love how well you kept the original concept excellent graphics excellent game play,5
Love this game,5
Love it,4
"I think this is just as good, if not better than the PC version!",5
Gg,5
"Very fun even when not buying gems, the only downside is There are features that are supposed to give you a daily reward for having friends on Facebook who also play however those features don't seem to work.",4
Not too bad. Fun. I wish I could get to start over now that I know what I'm doing.,4
It doesn't even let me get past the first part,1
It's kool,4
Thought it would be a fun take on being a dungeon boss stopping pesky adventurers. Just another boring pay to play mobile game like clash of clans,2
Don't waste your time,1
Whoot.,5
Challenging and keeps you interested with,5
1 day I got on and my dungeon was gone I'm wondering how long this one will last.,3
"I had to uninstall this game because for some reason, no matter what I have my volume set too, the notifications from this game are read out loud at full volume. Not ideal when sitting at work and my phone starts screaming how my ogres have completed training.",2
Thanks for bringing this game back loved DK2 this is fing awesome!,5
SUPERCALAFRAGILISTICEXPIALODOCIOUS,5
Graphics are nice but there are much better game like this out there. No boss heros and every minion you send into battle dies. If they are alive at the end you should get them back.,3
Could have been better,2
"Super fun gameplay. Spend just as much time building and redesigning. Always more fun when you can be the ""bad guy""",5
This game is a lot of fun so far. Only issue I've had is it disconnects the game and reloads Everytime my wifi disconnects.,4
Addictive like crack lmfao,4
YESSSSS! These Graphics are A-MAZE-ING!!!!!! ULTRA MEGA SUPER ADDICTIVE!!!!!!!!!!,5
I'm only through my first raid but I'm feeling the games layout. I will re rate after some more time spent playing. Well done guys.,4
"Hey, make DK2. Use the same assets, but make the game $5 and make it the way it is meant to be made. ""The intended audience"" apparently didnt like it as much as EA hoped. NOW make DK, for the fans. No free to play timers and gem BS. Please. Touch screen is the perfect device for this game.....",1
Feels good to be evil and slap some Imps around.,5
Will fix rating when social fixed. Please fix the social aspect. Game cannot be accessed through fb. Searching dk on fb gives an error stating page is unavail or expired. Cannot add friends. Cannot visit or test friends dungeons.,1
Just plain fun!,5
Awesome,5
So gooooood,5
The is pretty awesome!,4
I played this game WAAAY that much back in the day. Glad to see a decent homage paid.,5
Its a great time killer,5
"Love it, just wish there was more",5
"Love this game. I never really like games like this, but this one if amazing",5
It is an awesome game I love it,5
A bit confusing at first... Too bad this game micro manages my gameplay. Not willing to wait to see IF I can play. Bye.,1
I love this game,5
Not bad but too many things require purchases. Example: the imps that are needed cost an arm and a leg,4
I got it on comp lmao,5
Joyfully reminds me of the old PC game.,5
That Nostalgia,5
It is fun,5
Love the game,5
This game reminded me of the old one.  Very cool,4
"Crap. Basic mechanics might be fun, but the monetization strategy ruins the game irrevocably.",1
I love playing the game. HOWEVER It is impossible to play this game with spending a ton of money. I bought jewels twice no more the longer you play the more expensive it gets.,1
"EA, spend everything.",1
I love this game super addictive and very fun.,5
I wasnt able to play on pc so I am glad theres an easily playable version,5
Would need a manual and a room destroy button. Otherwise its great,3
Another pay to win game,3
If nothing else you get to slap imps around and they get happy about it,5
"It's definitely new, good... but new",4
"Absolutely atrocious, EA should be ashamed and you shod be ashamed for playing.",1
I'm being asked to rate this game after playing for only a few minutes...,2
I used to love playing the original computer version of this game...this is a nice mobile updated version of the game,4
Reminds me of clash or boom beach overall pretty fun,4
But the microtransactioms kill the game.  I'd rather pay once for reasonable times across the board than this crap.,1
Not as good as the original but still fun.,5
I like the game a lot. The problem is the server. A lot of times I have a hard time connecting to the server.,3
Dope game.,5
E.A. need I say more?,2
"A fun game overall. Most of the improvements are time gated though. The game has a unique SUPER OBNOXIOUS notification sound, so be sure to turn them off.",4
Matchmaking needs serious help.  14k attacking 3k trophy.  You will loose way more just in trap rearm cost.  Guild system is nice.,2
"EA had a chance to release an awesome game to a whole new generation but instead we get this ""micro""transaction bs. I put micro in quotes cause you can buy the 100 or 200 or 300 dollar package. What a disgrace to gaming.",1
same as the old DK.  wish this version had the same evil dialogue.  some time the guy don't say all the text.,4
I've been playing the old dungeon keeper and this is great,5
A mix between clash and old school dungeon keeper,5
Nice app.,4
Great game just like the old school keeper from the computer,5
This game rocks just like the old one on PC did love it if you play on PC this is a must for your Mobile devices,5
Takes way too long to get anywhere. Another spend money to really do anything kind of game. The comp game back in the day was awsome,2
I played Dungeon keeper and dungeon keeper 2 on the pc.. this is a great game. . I am glad Horny lives on,5
About 5 minutes in and I'm already being attacked by other players.  No thanks.,2
Fun little game,4
"Why would you turn a good PC game into a horrible mobile app, just give us the original game on mobile, and let us pay for it!!!",1
I love this game. Keeps me intrigued. I played the cpu version alot when i was younger lolz,5
After finding gold in the first dungeon it locks up,2
It reminds me why I played the original,5
Not as good as dungeon Keeper 2 but it's cool still,4
I love this game so much,5
So far so good.,5
Why not,5
Wanted this game from years ago. AE need to make more publicity  on games like this!,5
Love it,5
Nostalgia mixed with our love of time sinking micromanagement,5
Fun little dungeon builder.,4
Love it,5
Great game and time killer,4
Remind me of the old game,5
Cool concept,5
working good so far,5
Pretty cool.  Different take on the normal dungeon or build game,5
Wanted this game so badly and finally got it! Two thumbs up,5
I had it for years but now I had to get a better tablet and a new Gmail so I'll haft to start over but I know how the game is now and will spend my gems wisely,5
"The game is creative,  intense,  and absolutely great graphics.  I think the 2.5 dimension is a great aspect,  and the troops are pretty fun",5
I like this app,5
"Nothing like the original and frankley, just complete s**t. Takes forever to actually play and micro transactions are completely ruining the game.",1
Hubby and I live this game. Great graphics and game play. Definitely recommend;,5
There is no balance I get attacked so often I don't have enough resources to upgrade anything. Also the match making is brutal enough to allow me to get raided constantly by players nearly twice my level,1
"Someone finally created a fun, quick, simple and good looking builder style RTS !",5
Love this game !!!,5
"Honestly this and sometimes Warlight are all I play. In DK you can mix Tetris, tower defense, and Risk all in one.",5
"Various app seemed to have persistent notifications, after a while I deleted data and uninstalled.later I realized the ""block notifications"" was off. I reinstalled this to find myself starting over. Another game app had a pop up saying allow ""play services"" permission access to Camera, Microphone, body sensor, and (a 4th creepy function that has nothing to do with acc. Syncing). After allowing those permissions dungeon keeper synced itself RESTORING MY PROGRESS before all this happened",5
Takes me back to early nineties.,4
"It's pretty fun, kills time.",4
So goooooooood,5
Love this game.,5
Love it,4
"I'm a huge fan of the Dungeon Keeper games. This is not a real DK game. This a Clash of Clans Clone, with 3x as much forced micro purchases.",2
Fun time,4
"game looks good, seems fun. but I've had a few connection issues. other than that I'm interested in this game.",4
See title,3
"I have loved D.K.  since it first came out for the Pc. Like how it has been integrated for Android platform. May not be the good old D.K. Silver, but all the elements are still there. Good job.",3
So COOL this is an amazing game and there is no game like it and I LOVE horny he's funny cool and BADASS. And he makes me feel like a champ.... But there is one bad thing... I don't have internet and the schools wifi won't let me play and I struggle to get to places to get it and if y'all can make offline also that would be GREAT! but y'all don't have to... Just sayn... PLEASE!,5
"Always loved flying in fpv in the old games, this one's great though",5
I love this game,5
Very addictive reminds me of the Original game,4
My favorite!,5
If you love boom beach and dungeons you'll love this game. It is a bit PTW but not so much you need to.,5
Makes you wait for everything.  Gems are too hard to get without spending money.  But it's fun sometimes,3
Awesomeness,5
The more you play the more you pay!,1
I used to play this game on my old pc. This app is even more fun than I remember!!!,5
Good job much like the computer version,5
And because it i lost a perfect run and I'm tried of it this game sucks. Dont bother get anything out it you'll be disappointed like i have.,1
This game is awesome,5
When I first loaded this game I said this looks cool,5
Great remake of an old PC game,5
Played and beat it on all ways on the old PC copy and I played both original and the 2nd and great games but this version sucks horney balls it's nothing like dungeon keeper they should of kept it exactly the same this version sucks hands down.,1
Was great. Still crashes somtimes,4
I have played many many games searching for one that i can finally sink my time into. I must say congratulations EA you truly have made a amazing game,5
Really well done!,5
Kinda fuuuuuuuun,5
Great game,5
Love there sqeals,5
The only thing I would like to see are shorter upgrade times.,5
"This game was fun at first, but later on I was disgusted and afraid. The supposed helper was more like the devil than a helper, making me feel forced to do things and causing me stress, then telling me I have to torture for the fun of it. After this horrid experience, I doubt I'll ever play this again.",1
Very good,4
Great game I had this for the computer growing up its awesome,5
"People should really mind having to spend hundreds of times the retail value of a game just to experience gameplay that resembles a retail version of said game, but they don't. It's a con... And, by ""retail"", I mean a standard paid version with no IAP.",1
Good so far,4
Super addictive,4
Old school baby,4
Cool game,5
"Awesome free to play dungeon keeper, perfect for mobile platform",5
I love it....‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,5
I've loved this game since it was PC but this mobile version... it's taken a lot of our freedom away. And it likes to force you to play with other people. I don't like that aspect. Dungeon keeper isn't a clone of every other app out on the playstore stop trying to make it be.  It was never intended to be a crappy clone. Make it more like the original and itll get better reviews.,3
"The pay aspects are a little out there (read: ""high""), but has thus far been more than reasonable as a time-killer with some real amount of real-time play so it's not a TOTALLY ""wait-and-see"" experience. Deserves all of it's four stars assuming that the game doesn't suddenly spring the dreaded and looming PayWall of The CellTablet Empire this soon in.",4
AWESOME üíÄüëçüëç,4
Dongen keeper won't connect to server please help,1
Be as evil as you want defending your dungeon and attacking others. The best part for me is Horney egging you on in his deep dark voice.,5
Takes days and it wants you to purchase things for use in the game. Things that should be more and freely available within the game itself. To pay $4.99 or more for anything in a game is just retarded. Game is really starting to piss me off. The last few times I've started a raid to get revenge it dumped me out before I could complete and it took all my minions & resources. I had to pay to get them back.,4
Awesome battles it's really fun,5
It's a good game.!,5
Wonderful... so much like the o.g. one from back in the day. Just wish you didn't have to be online all the time to play. But yes... the game is great,5
Awsome,5
Yay,5
Along with the records of it. So I'm very upset. Because I put $20 into this game and I really loved it and got pretty far in and now I have to start over. If you guys can please work with me here I'd play this game just as much as I used to but rn I'm upset I have data from all my hard work,1
"Cool ,fun,great graphics",5
Cool,4
Mildly entertaining but kinda on the boring side,4
"Loved it but with more updates has gradually come with them being able to access more and more of my device. After reviewing the terms and conditions, I have a few questions.. why to play their game do they need to be able to: view SD card content, delete or modify SD card content, compose, modify, and send emails from my device, make, receive,and end phone calls on my device, record, post on any of my social media accounts without my permission or notification, and having total access to phone. No thanks.",1
"Dark, satirical warplay. Theyre always doing something to improve the game too.",4
Played DK on the pc years ago and loved it. This game is very addictive. Fantastic graphics.,5
"Used to love this game, then managed to get my hands on an OG copy of Dungeon Keeper.",1
Upgrading building past a cretin level will cost you a lot of real money or time problem is you can't get any gold as you're always being raided. So this game is just like all the other pay to win games. Play if you like frustration.,1
Epic,5
Fun to waste time on when you have nothing else to do.,5
Lots of fun and doesn't require in app purchases to advance,4
Lots of fun,5
Just awsome,5
Good way to waste some time.,5
"Fun as hell, I miss the original DK.",5
"Free, 2Play $To Help Developers. Download Now, you Won't Regret. Highly Recommended. Better than Clash?????.,and Other Games. I wish I Knew this Game Before. Very Addictive. This Game should be the Top#1 On all of the Games. Best Game I ever found and Play. Everybody should be Playing this Game. No other Game Bits DK. You should be Downloading Now.",5
Aswsome game keep up the good work,4
Very addictive,5
"but this version leaves a lot to be desired. First, and foremost, this game has no balancing. You'll get raped by flying creatures, just as soon as you have enough resources to take. You have no defense against this. You might as well be a Stanford coed, with EA as the incompetent judge.  There is ZERO response from support.  The game is filled with micro transactions, even just to dig out your dungeon.  Don't waste your time hoping to find enough nostalgia to carry you through this garbage.",1
If things didn't take so long it would be a much better game.,4
Love it,5
Very fun,5
Fun,4
5,5
A blast from the past. Takes a long time to get strong. Has issues with dropping connection frequently. Gets stuck at  checking for updates frequently. Drops connection mid battle causing a loss. Still a fun game overall! Imps are way too expensive.,4
"This game serves for a dark reminder of what can happen to even the best of games, turning a cult classic into this. The classic dungeon keeper that has held tightly onto the hearts of many a gamer has been warped into this: A pay for all husk of a game. However this nonetheless is a ""blood"" connection to the dungeon keeper of old, and in some areas holds to its old self. The dark humor is still there, the characters are there (warped and husked but there), and the dungeon building is still there.",4
"This game was made from the company bullfrog.dungeon keeper and dungeon keeper gold were made for PC ,then ea comes and takes the name and claims they made the game.",2
The downloading updates every time i open the app! It takes forever,3
Easy to learn and fun,5
Cool game,5
"Enchanting, beautiful, tactical, and leaves you wanting more.",5
"The game played fine 3 months till i tryed to update it, have not been able to play since, it's been over a year now.",2
"I've been a fan of Dungeon Keeper II ever since it was published by Bullfrog. I would like to see a revised Theme Park World in this fashion, with the original Theme Park World music!",5
I'm loving this,5
"Micro-Transaction is so pushed you might as well buy fallout 4 for cheaper than climbing the leaderboards in this ""game""",1
"Hate the new mechanic of pay for stamina games.  However, this is every bit as fun as the old PC games.  A welcome return of a blast from the past.",4
"I used to think this was good but I've seen the light, screw you ea.",1
Better than the desktop version I have such don't memories of.,5
I want to play the game but it keeps crashing. doesn't need internet?,3
Very awesome,5
Nothing like dungeon keep but stil brings back old mebrys,5
Sucks,1
Thanks for the bug fix.Now I can play.Two thumbs up.,5
I could play this for years and never get tired of it!!!,5
Love it,5
I just started playing and im being attacked regularly by people with like 1k points and i only have 20 so there are clear balance issues if high levels can raid lower ones,2
Perfect,5
Haven't had to pay a dime to enjoy. Which is nice since I don't give money to EA. Ever.,5
Great  that old classic  available  and still  fun.,5
Good so far,4
Um it's okay I guess.... The real game was way better,3
I tried it.... Now I'm out to make my dream dungeon.,5
Great game...still like the old pc version though. Cost for imps is way too high.,4
Mayhem. Fire. Destruction.  And then back to reality.  What great way to relax.,4
"Picture everything you liked about Dungeon Keeper. Got it? Good. Now get rid of all of that, stick the pictures on top of Clash of Clans and you have this steaming pile of warm garbage.",1
"I play a bunch of them. DK isn't my favorite but it is by far the funniest and most unique. The graphics, voices, sounds, and game play are all top notch. Some of my friends say it's not the same as the original PC version. So what? That doesn't detract from this being a fun and addicting game. Play it!",4
Interesting game,5
H E R E W E G O,3
"The off the wall comments are outright funny, Game is fun.",5
not as good as the original but its still pretty fun,4
Its a fun game and an nice way to relax. Nothing like the PC game. I do wish I could have more imps and more control of my imps working together.,4
Just as rember it.,5
Loved it,5
Wish it was easier to get the 3rd imp w/o spending real life money.,4
But it brings me back to a teenager love it,5
Great game,4
Great game ... For just being a bunch timers,4
"It's great and very enjoyable, way better than that stupid clash of clans game.",5
Not to be underestimated!,5
I love it,5
Too early to see if this game will hold out. It's very fun for now and does well entertaining me. Would recommend,4
Offline now but a great game,5
Though I wish there was less of a pay to play and more of a just play feel to it,4
Its awesome game and well though out,5
Fantastic game.  Good adaptation of the original games,5
What if they revived the series and it became an eSport?,4
Good remake from  the pc version.,4
Close to original worth a look,4
I loved this game years ago. I'm so happy that it's an app now!,5
I would love to play but can't get in to the game bc all it dose is check for updates,1
Awsome,5
"A little too comic-like for my tastes, but is reminiscent of the original.",4
I loved the original.   Of course this app isn't the same and it takes a lot of patience.   A good guild is a must.,4
Played this game as a kid on windows 95. Love it.,5
This game is like the demon child of the original dungeon keeper and clash of clans i love this game.,5
Loading is too slow too have to wait for a just seen the start of the game when they should just be Take 2 seconds and that is a pretty good game,4
Building your dungeon the way you want while summoning minions to build your army for raiding is a lot of fun.,4
"No matter how many traps and upgrades, your dungeon will lose pvp. Also, it's too slow in upgrading, mining, and building.",1
Ehhh,4
"Poor excuse for a DK game. Would be much better without the forced, and unbalanced PvP. Not that it matters, the game hasn't been updated in almost a year now. Which tells me EA doesn't care about the player base.",2
Will not run on a Dell Venue 8 3830,3
Couldn't stop playing it loved it so much,5
"I had the original Dungeon Keeper way back, and while the mobile game is quite different, it's still enough to trigger nostalgic feelings.  It's pretty fun, with a fair level of challenge and a well-balanced looting system.  I never feel wiped out after I'm raided, but I always feel satisfied with my gains when I successfully raid.  That's really saying something, in this style of game!",5
Enjoyed since the original,5
Love it,5
easily move around. Tunnels keep appearing instead of my being able to move around the dungeon easily. Please fix this by adding a movement panel.,2
Making your own dungeon is amazing. 'Nuff Said.,5
Its fun for a browser tower defense game,5
Great game!,5
"Fun, but not the original.  :(",4
It's fun to play but I have to keep reinstalling it it play. Now I can't play it at all.,3
This game is the best ever and very addictive and i really don't even play mobile games hardly because i get bored of them real quick and that horny guy is freaking awesome u hardly even know what he will say next he's freaking cruel at times lol and i love it and thanks to the creators of this game u guys are freaking cool...thanks,5
Great job resurrecting this amazing game.,5
Does not work,5
Great game. I played the original and loved it. This brings the original right back into the fold again. Its fun to see all the funny things and comedy back into this version. I love funny games like this. Another that comes to mind is the remake of Bards Tale. I hope they also do a remake for DK2. Great job guys in the build. I have had zero problems playing the game and the loading times aren't overwhelming. Thanks for bringing such a great game back to us old school and just old players.,5
"This isn't free to play, its completely unplayable without paying beyond the tutorial. Ruined my childhood :(",4
So fun to play,5
I loved dungeon keeper back in the day. This is not that game.,1
Unique spin on the oh so boring common build your town and attack other towns until you get to the point that it takes days to build something,5
"It's been a long time since there's been any movement on a Dungeon Keeper game. I still play the first, it's my favorite. So to have one on my phone I can take anywhere is bringing back good childhood memories of breaking computer time limits. My only thing with this game is the cost of items. Other than that I love it so far.",4
I don't have to pay to expand my dungeon best game ever,5
"I played DK years ago, was pleasantly surprised to find this app.",4
Love it,5
"It's as much as it can be like the game, as an app! Better than I thought it'd be.",5
I njoy the humor and so far it's not too complicated of a gaym,4
It is a super fun addictive,5
This helped me rediscover my love of the original pc version... I love it,5
Great game.,5
"It's pricey, but it's still the game you know and love.  Fun fun fun.",5
Awesome 'nuff said,5
I love it,5
I played this game on the P.C a lot as a kid. Im happy they brought it to an app! Great job guys!,5
Yup,5
So cool,5
Great game,4
Evil is good,5
"I wish that the upgrading didn't take so long, but the interaction between the players for me is half the fun.",4
Aint nobody got time fo dat,3
"This game is so fun, but I can only play it for about 2 or 3 minutes every day. Not because of my work schedule, but because the game crashes, disconnects, and completely fails to load 9.9 times out of 10. And when I do get to play for more than 13 seconds before the code 7 message or imps tidying up message stops my play I get dropped at the worst times: in the middle of raids and rebuilds. When dropped during a raid btw you lose, even if you were a single HP away from victory. During rebuilds your dungeon is vulnerable to attack when your defences are down. I love this game and I hope the developers can fix these issues, but at the moment it's unplayable.",1
I can't wait to build a better dungon,5
Killin time,5
This game is amazing I love it,5
"Great game, not pay to win. Like the original, with the ability to go against players. Good game for those with tactical minds..",5
"People complain that this is a tower defense- that's essentially what the other DK games are. Also, this is a really excellent tower defense, without sacrificing the ability to win for freemium privilege. The humor and darkness ironically brighten my day, and I love destroying dungeon after dungeon, and watching foolish players beach themselves on my fiery shores.",5
"I was hoping for an experience more similar to the old pc game. But this is just another town builder/money grab. I quickly grew bored with the game when it became obvious how long it takes to accomplish anything, and how unfair/unbalanced the pvp raids are. Uninstalled.",2
Amazing,5
Excellent,5
Best game ever,5
Have it on 3devices...,5
It's really addicting and it is sometimes challenging,5
I like it.,3
This game was great when it first came out on the PC and still going strong.,5
"Just another game that bogs you down early to extract money. Try making a quality game, not taking advantage of nostalgia for easy profit. Next.",2
Really fun,5
What's the point of making a dungeon strategically when an invader can just blow through any number of walls and back-door everything? It makes offense boring and defense pointless.,1
"So far, a very fun game that incorporates all of the attributes that made the PC version an immortal classic! Enhanced very nicely with the multiplayer aspect!",5
Good game,5
"This was my favorite game back in the day. Gameplay is almost identical. Adapted for mobile of course. Fast paced when your dungeon is running efficiently. Guild tournaments are fun. The prizes are useful. Developers are readily available when problem should ever occur. For me, only once in four years.",5
I liked the first one better but this one is way more unique and I like the gameplay I recommend this app,5
Didn't receive purchase because of error.  Still waiting on it.,1
Loved this game when i was younger. Glad to see it back.,5
Ok it's fun and pretty awesome but the constant trying to get you to participate with others and such I can do without. I found this game through Google play as a Single player game and really it's not. It doesn't like to work off line either. An Android function most of the time.e offline so would the games.,4
It's awesome to play I recommend it to other people,5
The game gets better the longer you play,4
"This is a good revisit to a classic pc game. The graphics are more cartoonish than its predessessor,  but the movement is more user- friendly and far fewer steps are  involved with the building process.",4
"Great game. A little slow in the beginning, but it really picks up.",5
I like watch mojo but it was wrong it said this game is boring but he is wrong,5
it stops being fun when it becomes a waiting simulator. Why play when you need to wait a week for something to finish?,2
"Love this take on the clash pf clans model, very fun!",5
I have been looking for a dungeon management game forever... and this is one of the best I have ever played,5
I really enjoy this game if anyone reading this likes dungeon games you should download and play dungeon keeper,5
It says it's checking for updates but I just downloaded from this is stupid,2
Still love it brings back memories,5
Awesome!,5
"Possibly the worst game ever, maybe thats just because it is an android game.",1
It keeps telling me it can't connect  but I'm sitting right next to modem and still can't connect,2
since last night,1
Too long to build unless you want to spend a lot of money.,2
Awsome,5
Love it!!,5
This game is awesome way.better than any of my other games,5
This game is a massive pay to win game. It is fun but severely unbalanced,2
The new update keeps updating every time you log on and takes hours even days to play. Then when you finally play just one battle it stops and says checking for updates again. There's a tournament going on now and I may not be able to play because of it. Please fix it. I love the game but only if I can play.,5
A lot like the classic game,4
Great time killer,5
Good so far. Looks like fun.,4
Best game ever,5
A lot of fun!,5
Great fun for the go,5
Awesome,5
"Seriously, a very entertaining game because it is addictive. You want to sit there and build and add hallways and doors and traps and move your rooms around so much that you forget what time it is. Before you know it you have been designing and trashing other people's dunegons for hours and your phone is nearly out of battery power. Good game!!",4
The absolute best,5
Enjoying this game alot. Tons of fun for killing a little time,5
Very easy to play reminds me of the old PC game just updated,5
Wouldnt check for updates even,1
Basically clash of clans with the dk theme. But still great time killer and pretty fun.,5
Fun and a little addictive.,5
"This game could be better if EA implemented aspects from the first and second games into this mobile it would be so much better I am rating this game with three stars because it can be improved, oh also the micro-transactions are just out of this world just saying EA I would rather buy this game for $4.99 and be able to do what the original games would let me do than buy gems for a outrageous price every time I need them.",3
Great game..... Brings me back to my youth,5
Reminds me of the old Bullfrog DOS days ;). .... . Yeaaaa buddy!,5
Pretty cool,5
This game is too loaded with micro transactions. It's about as ftp and star citizen.,1
Great!,4
It's a good game. Plus I always enjoy being the bad guys now and then.,4
LOVE THIS GAME. VERY ADDICTIVE AND FUN TO PLAY!! I'D RECOMMENDED THIS GAME!,5
"Takes forever to upgrade unless you spend money, other than that it's a fun game",4
I loveeeeeeeeeee it,5
It say I need more space but I got over 10gb to use smh,1
Impressive. Most impressive.,5
Brings me back to my childhood loved these games especially DK2,5
I still play the original dungeon keeper on the pc and this is definitely a close update. Maintains the feel of the old game while showing new features.,4
Awesome just like the oldschool one,5
Cool game,5
"Sweet game, takes a while to build your dungeon up, but just like any other building android game. Love it",5
"I have loved this game, ever since I played it for the first time, on pc",5
Better than the first,4
I love how this almost like the p.c. game of lore....a bit easier to play.,5
So much fun to play,5
"Just installed this, hopefully it's as good as it's PC predecessors... I shall let you know.",4
I love the original. This one is just as good.,5
Fun game... Good graphics. Takes a while to build a decent dungeon though.,4
It is a pretty good game I haven't played any of the other games looking forward to finding one of them but yeah not bad at all to my knowledge.,5
Fun,5
Really fun!!,5
As good as ever.,5
In app purchases are mandatory. Those who pay vs those who don't is painfully obvious.,2
Dungeon keeper is awesome,5
Brings back memories of older games üòà,5
Dumb,2
U have to wait to long to get stuff done,3
Can't get the wallpaper :/ could we swipe HR plz ^^,4
Game it's quite good,5
I'm not a fan of losing troops on raids and am finding it a little slow to move forward. On the plus side it runs smoothly and looks good.,3
"Just charge us for the game, guys. I would rather pay up front for a real game instead of getting a ""free"" game that costs me way too much in microtransactions to be enjoyable.",1
Pay to win.  Just got crushed by one count it one mob that flew in.  Not wasting any more time,1
Great game wish build times was a little shorter,5
The sence of nastalgia is amazing not quite like the original but its still so much fun!,5
"It would be 5 stars if I could just pay for game, get tired of all the games being free with in game purchasing.",3
"I have to admit that this has been a lot of fun so far. As always, micro transactions are annoying, but they give you a good bit of gems up front. All in all though, this has been one of the more enjoyable games on Android; at least for me.",5
"Overall good game, takes some time to get used to the new system.  But I like it.",4
"This is the fourth time that several hundred of my gems (which you need to do anything) have just disappeared. Also, four days to upgrade a room or spend 400+ gems? Uninstalling.",2
Amazing,5
"Fun, fun, fun!",5
I need to be able to restart if I want to.,4
It's a cute little game BUT it's too hard to get started.   I'm not spending a fortune to buy gems and stuff so I don't see myself playing for very long.,3
"I am a big fan of Dungeon Keeper and this is just a terrible spin off. It takes way too long to get anything done. I thought it would get better as I played, but I was sadly mistaken. Don't bother installing this game.",1
If you ever played the original Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 then this is a great addition full of little jokes and good old dungeon combat,5
Super fun game to kill time!,5
"Sad that we no longer challenge the lords of the lands, that was a big part of the fun of the old game.",4
"I loved DK back in the day, and now with this app it goes with me too. Needs an offline mode however.",5
"It's very satisfying watching failed attacks. But, I don't like the wall destroying immortal or the spell. Feels too cheap.",4
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes it rocks!,5
Horrible,1
"Very cool game, everyone likes to be evil sometimes. Muhaha",5
Really fun,5
If this would play like the cd computer I would play it 24/7...  I played the computer cd over 16 hours straight.. I can't wait for the turn based multiple player like up to 3 minutes extra time rolls over to next fight. Your in the center of a cube you can get attacked from any open door portal. In pc more land = +1 mana,5
Its pretty fun,5
Would be more fun if I had 100 bucks to blow on the gems. Without them the game takes years to get anywhere. A fun game though still.,4
So far so good I think that there should be more space in the dungeon floor so you can make crazy little pathways other than that keep up the great work folks.,5
Super fun,5
Pay to play or wait to play.,1
It's clash but your minions fight instead of just sitting there doing nothing,5
This awesome,5
Great twist on. A classic pc game,5
A complete waste of time.,1
This is all against my will.,5
It's not bad,4
"Er,  see title.",5
All I ask I is MORE GEMS,5
Reminiscent of the classic PC game. A bit put off on the emphasis of PvP... But overall good.,4
This is an old computer game I use to play but I wish they used the same graphics and old gameplay other than micro transactions,5
Played it on my old phone now im restarting on my new 1 cant wait to rule,5
"Its a really fun game, but they try too hard to make you buy gem stones to progress. It takes litterally hours to mine just a few gems and to buy your 4th minion costs 750 gems, and buying gems is expensive; if not for that, id rate it 5 stars.",3
Only lacking area is more strategic variance in traps allowing for a greater customisation and emphasis on tactic and strategy over shear spam and upgrades.,4
I used to play this on th e Computer when I was lil,4
Love it,5
Being attacked four times in one day can't even get revenge on one without being attacked again and being down for another 8 hours waiting for my immortal to recover,3
"It's a real time killer if you prefer to play games like minecraft, factorio, and/or this game's predecessor ""Dungeon Lord."" For those who have not played dungeon lord; it is a strategy game, but single player and you get your own little avatar to run around as and capture heroes who come into your dungeon to do two to five things, ranging from killing your dungeon heart, to saving captives, and even to just read a book. Like this game you can make the dungeon floor plan look however you wished. Like the older version, this is fun, but like every Facebook game out there, you can either be patient and not have to waste money or play on the dangerous line.",4
It's just so fun when you get to really high levels like clash of clans,5
It seems fun but for some reason it keeps going black screen and have to close the app please fix,4
It tacks to long for some stuff,4
It is just another app that forces you to wait to build anything unless you pay for special items with real money and it's PVP like everything else on mobile devices. I do not recommend.,1
This game is amusing and addictive for me,5
Plays somewhat like the desktop version which was always fun.,4
Yea this may look fun but you'll never get play because all it says is cannot comen to sever,1
Too much micromanaging for this to ever be as good as the pc games... not even close.,1
I feel safe and happy in my dungeon. I'm gonna stay for a nice long visit.,5
Funn,4
Good game not as good as the original,5
Boooiii,4
This one will keep you grinding in the dungeons for days.,4
Yea,5
Best thing,5
"It's fun to play, and the tutorial is actually enjoyable. Taking down other keepers is a ton of fun.",5
Up to 3 time down loading the game In one day Seems good not like the original dungeon keep like I thought it would be now after giving this review the game won't load this is now the second time I have had to uninstall and reinstall the game today to make it work,3
"The requirement for the game to have access to my phone information felt so shady that I installed this on tablet just to make sure they wouldn't have access to information that they could sell to advertisers. As far as gameplay goes, I bearly got past the tutorial before hitting the wait 4 hours wall. I seriously don't get why people enjoy games that practically kill the gameplay for several hours in order to encourage you to spend money to play the game at the pace it is supposed to be played. I'm betting that most of the people who gave this five stars never played the original and have accepted that freemium models (such as this one) are the norm for mobile gaming. EA should be ashamed of turning what was once a beloved franchise into their own personal cash grab on the mobile gaming market. The really sad part is that I would have been willing to pour $10-15 into this game if they didn't have an internet requirement or freemium model. Now they are getting nothing from me.",1
Best dungeon game ever,5
Fun and goofy.,4
Addictive,5
"If this game twisted my arm any harder to buy gem packs, I would have a compound fracture.  Don't dwindle your money away on a clown game like this.  Buy an android game for $ 5-15 and actually enjoy yourself.  I bought Crashlands for $5 ..... best money I spent for a game ever",1
Reminds me of the old school dungeon keeper,5
This game is easy and fun. Interest,5
Very much like the older version on PC,4
This was one of my all time favorite PC games and adapted well to Android. Sure its a free-mium game but still fun as hell and raiding!,5
"Very addictive. For some reason, it's more engaging than some of the other games of the genre.",5
The game overall is good. It does have some glitches such as crashing when you finish two raids. Back to back of course. The scarcity of Imps impedes some. However the overall game function is well.,4
"This Game is bull, and should dies in a fire. If you want to play a piece of crap game that will charge you more than a titanic computer, get this, otherwise, avoid this game!",1
"I think this game is a ton of fun but there are a few features I would change a bit for it to be more cohesive to users. The game is a tribute to an old video game's impression of clash of clans or backyard monsters. The digging is a mixed blessing but the online experience of pvp is a lot of fun. I also enjoy the ""{dailies"" to accure gems. I have purchased gems a few times but it truly is a great game.",4
You took a great series and turned it in to a Facebook game.  Uninstalled ages ago.  Will not come back.,1
"It sure as heck isn't Dungekn Keeper 3, but as a Clash of Clones genre it's still pretty competent. Love the power fantasy. Imps are way overpriced though, making the store feel a bit greedy (even for EA).",4
So much waiting and not enough fairness...,3
Pimp-slap all of you! like I do my minions,5
Dungeon building  at its finest. I'm sure it's more fun with spending  money but it's definitely  playable  as it is.,4
"Waiting for thing sucks, but holds true to the old dungeon keeper feel. Great game.:-)",4
"If I weren't a fan of Dungeon Keeper I'd have probably rated this lower. It's very greedy. Unless you shell out a good chunk of cash the most action you'll get in this game is logging in to get your imps working on something else. The gameplay is also very pay to win. It's okay when you start out because you have chumps to go up against, but later on it doesn't matter how good of a keeper you are, someone who shelled out some money for boosts will raid you.",3
"Just like the old school PC game, only WAYY BETTER!!! Hell yes!!!",5
"While the game is definitely trying to get you to buy gems the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of the old DK games, though more family friendly than its predecessors. Fun time sink.",5
It's fun enough I got a new phone and this was one of the first ten apps I got back!,5
"I loved the original PC game back in the 90s, so when I saw this version I installed it on my tablet. There's enough similarities to the original that it didn't take long to start building. The main issue I have with it is losing connection in the middle of an attack, losing the battle, my win streak, and any minions and mana I had deployed to that point. PvP matchmaking could also use some work, as I get repeatedly raided by players that are much higher level than I am. Save up your gems to buy more imps (you'll make plenty from digging), and it is free to play. Just expect to be farmed by players who bought their way to the top.",3
It's a pleasant challenge and starts out players with a good start,5
It takes a little patience but it's pretty addictive. I did however spend a few bucks just so I could have five imps and I've been pleased so far. It's not one to sit and play for hours but to jump on and get ur fix for a bit,4
"It's a (vastly overpriced) pay to do nearly anything. You can muddle along, taking months to get your full cadre of imps and advance to the big leagues. Or plunk down hundreds of dollars.",4
"Really can't tell if I'm having any fun with this app, feels like I'm looking at a loading screen 80-85% of the time with an occasional code 7, i really want to give it a fair chance but until this issue is resolved I don't think i can",2
Super fun had the original in the 90's on pc,5
I,5
It's a funny game but not a fun game.  Starts off strong but ends up being not a game at all.  It's like clash of clans but you progress even slower (yah.  Slow)  pros:  funny.  Troops build fast.  Raiding nets a lot of resources.  Cons.  Glacial pace.  No way to drop trophies.  Pvp puts you against much higher level players,3
Really love this game almost the same as pc version thanks for putting this game out there for phones very great,5
"Played the game for a few months. Somehow my google account attached to game was disconnected. When i reconnected it, the game reset to the very begining. Contacted their ingame support and asked for them to restore my game or refund my game purchases and they ignored me. Typical EA",1
Great game. Great strategy game. Great graphics.,5
SO MUCH FUN.,5
Fun,5
Cccccccccccccoo9oooooooolllll,5
This game is fun and a time killer,5
There's not a lot that separates this game from other similar ones but the theming is well done and it is enjoyable. The in game purchase options are annoying but you can get a lot out of it without spending anything.,4
Why with the chin,5
Funny game building a dark dungeon.   Lots of laughs and strategy to boot.,4
It keeps you interested.,5
"I've always loved games where I'm in control of the dungeon and its' traps. Having a mobile dungeon in my pocket is just icing on the cake. Great traps, great minions. Only thing i'd change is slightly shorter build/ upgrade times. But even that's not so bad.",5
It's awesome but complicated in a good way I suggest you download,5
"Make no mistake, this app was not created to provide a fun experience for users. It exists for one purpose and one purpose only: to make money off of micro-transactions. Another naked cash grab by Electronic Arts, the company that has made itself famous by buying out indie developers and running them into the ground in pursuit of profit.  If you download this ""game,"" be prepared for lots of anti-features such as ridiculously long wait times to perform the simplest tasks (4 real-time hours to dig a single square of dirt) which can, of course, be alleviated by putting in your credit card number and paying real money to speed the action up. Of course, the delay is entirely fictional and imposed by the creators of the ""game,"" so this is in effect like someone giving you poison and then selling you the antidote.  Do yourself a favor, if you're considering installing ""free to play"" games that tempt you to pay real money for made-up rewards, consider taking up gambling as a less expensive hobby. You'll still be throwing your money away, but there's a chance you might at least get some of it back.",1
I played the old PC version and this is close but just not the original.,4
"I love the game play, the only thing I don't care for is the cost of gems. But if you don't waste them during game play you actually make enough of them to purchase your imps. Give this game a try and I'm sure your going to love it.",5
Very reminiscent of the pc game easy to learn and addicting to play. Enjoy.,4
Server stability is questionable. But if you can get past that it is a fairly decent game.,3
"Neat concept, touchy controls, too many counters to try to get money",3
Well its not the original one on the pc. Sadly i got this from a website claiming it was a port...,1
Takes  2 months  to try to save for upgrade.  Just to lose it all in 24hrs.  Haven't been able to do a upgrade to dungeon for 6 months  what's the point of playing  good  bye!,1
Love it just like the pc one.,5
Very cool game but I wish you could like be more race like   new races you cane pick from,5
Fun,5
"Instead it's a pile of excrement in a sea of free to play micro transaction straight jacketed trash.  Do yourself and play the 1990's version for an absolutely amazing gameplay experience.  This game has no redeeming qualities unless a good quality in your mind is taking fantastic gameplay, changing the graphics for the worse and stopping any fin at all without consistent cash payment.",1
Loved it almost as I love the original,5
This game is awesome. Love the rap song you should make a. Notice one.  O and is there a game like this for pc and laptop,5
"Sick dk game but a Lil less p2p would be nice, should just made it more like the original",5
This is perfect for planning out dungeons for dnd,5
It like any other  game that want money,5
Reminds me of diablo but more of a modern clash of clans style play,5
Great game everything was blended well love some of the features.,5
It's fun it's not the same as the old pc game but still they put a fun twist on it. It's worth giving a shot if you're a fan of the old pc version =),4
Fun addictive game,5
Makes me miss the originals. Maybe we will get a true modern DK. The micro transaction model is so abused. But this is still a great game.,5
I used to play dungeon keeper as a kid I'm so stocked there is a mobile version,5
Awesome,5
"it's an incredibly fun game, however it is horrifically coded. It crashes constantly, it burns through my battery, which normally lasts 2 or 3 days, in under 2 hours. I can make it though like 2 or 3 raids without it crashing.",2
this game shouldnt be like thisshoudbe ike the old one where it is an rts instead  of pay to win greedy jerks.,1
Great idea and slots of fun come smack some mininons with me,5
"Made me miss Dungeon Keeper 2, but to much come back in an hour nonsense",2
Awsome game,5
Cool game,4
Good and fun,4
its fun I guess. I really like the tutorial guide,4
I used to play this game on the PC back in the day and it was one of my favorites but thy changed a lot of stuff it was better beafor however is till like this game it doesn't take much space up you get to slap your minions around hood game,4
Brings the game to mobile for new young people. A new generation gets to see the original one that started a genre,5
Nobody waste your time with this crap it sucks (like every other ea game),1
Love the original. A great mobile port.,4
I've always loved this game!,5
Cool game worth checking out,4
"Under the shadow of a great title, still, but pretty fun. I always set myself up for disappointment when I get excited about anything DK anymore, but this is best so far, by far.",4
Meh.,3
I like it so much,5
A great remake of the pc classic...,5
"After a while of not playing I wanted to get back into this app. I wanted to delete my save and start fresh to get back into it. Cannot find how to do so anywhere. Trying to get back into it, but just can't picking up where I left off...",1
Awesome,5
We'll see about greedy fingers in a few days...,5
Fun...different than the original PC game but still good. Wish there was an easier way to get imps though,4
"The matchmaking system is terrible.  I was enjoying this game, spent some money on it and fully intended to spend more, but at this point my low level dungeon is constantly being raided by higher level dungeons in higher league tiers. I'm getting hit by enemy mobs that I literally am not at a high enough level to defend against as I can't yet purchase the traps required to hit airborne enemies or whatever else. So they just come in, steamroll, take all my loot and that's that. How am I, someone in the bronze league, repeatedly being hit by people in the highest league that is AT LEAST 10 levels higher than me?  When I try to hunt for dungeons to attack the same type of thing happens. It'll match me against some poor person like 10 levels lower than me and yeah, I could go in for an easy victory but it just goes to show how terrible to matchmaking system is. So seriously, I'm out and my money goes with me. I know better than to waste time on something poorly designed that is likely to only get worse as I keep going. Dungeon Keeper's matchmaking is worse than Clash of Clans, and that says something. Save your time and money and opt for something else. That's my plan.",1
"Old school restart love it. So excited played the originals, was super sad when the 3rd one was never finished. Glad this came to make up for it.",5
This game has jokes. Fun gameplay. Nice way to pass the time.,5
"Nice remake, I'm a little sad that it is a bit pay to win in regards to imps. But it's a nicely done remake of a great game.",3
Amazing,5
Great Mate.,5
Played the game for a few days but got tired of how difficult it is to win raid matches once you level up...,2
"This is really fun however,  it will not let me chat, ask me my birth date everytime I click on chat",3
"Played the original games and this tablet/phone version is pretty awesome! It's kooliosis, I recommend it highly :D",5
I like it,4
Good game controls,4
Everything cost too many gems that cost money. Good game other than the cost to build up.,3
Good game could have more ways to earn gems. Can help pass the time. Worth playing,4
Still early but it's fun. I loved DK2 on pc. Cool game,4
Lots of fun. Love slapping stuff. Only thing is imps are a little to have to get,5
I liked it because it was like clash but it had a twist to it it made so basically everything felt more personal with raiding and getting your minions to work faster also I think the graphics are very good especially from a not so well known developer.,4
"It has the dungeon building/customizability of the original with a moble twist. I was hoping for a true remake of the original but this was an great 2nd best. ""DK2 is still great over 15 years later""",4
I had over 2000 hard earned gems and they just disappeared. What happened to them?,3
This  is  a  great  game,5
Excellent,5
It's an amazing game and it even has a great song you can download,5
I just love slapping the daylights out of the imps plus the i love the accent of the guy who talks. Other than that the game is enjoyable,5
Yay,5
try it,4
I absolutely love this game!! Very time consuming!! Only wish it was a bit easier to get imps.,5
Addictive,5
Classic,4
I love dungeon keeper! I play it on my computer now I can play on my phone as well! :-),5
I just don't like that my tablet or the game puts it into the minions are getting your dungeon back in order during a raid and I lose because of it but it's a good game though throw and throw.,4
"If you're made of money it's great, otherwise progress is very minimal. It's nothing like the original!!!",1
Eh it's ok,2
Brings back memories of the old PC games... Fun!,4
"I was enjoying it, until the update made it unplayable, and yet i continue playing, the latest update is fun, i like how it constantly kicks me to the home screen for no reason",1
"It's great, probably the best app I've ever seen. Although that's a little bit because i don't like very many apps i see, ever. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy the ever living crap out of it. But the fact of the matter is, gems are bullshit, in the original game imps were summoned in hundreds, why am i limited to three unless i spend 1,200 gems when nothing even gives me more than three or four gems at a time? Also, i don't understand what most of the game mechanics are due to the lack of an in depth tutorial.",5
Love it best time wasterever,5
Great game.,5
I highly recommend this game. You get to be a little evil...üòàüòàüòà,5
Awesome,5
plz more pepz paly this,5
Very much like the pc game I used to play. Love this!!,5
I was kicked out of the game,1
This game is very addictive thank you Electronic Art's,4
"I have been playing this game for a few year (since it came out for Android). At higher levels when you have put so much time into the game and then you get wiped by a certain type  player it is aggravating to say the least. It seems that if you use Tiny the Dragon and trap disable spells to disable anti-air defenses you can win every time. One unit ?   I am at level 80+, anti-air level 6, and a 4100 trophy level. Two days in a row I have been  attacked by the same player using the same tactic and loosing both times. The other player has over a 14,000 trophy count. This is not the only player to use this method and it happens every so often. What is also interesting is that all the players who seem able to do this are Korean.  I find it interesting that this is a known issue and in all this time nothing has been done. In the early stages the game was fun but now it is so bad as I have spent all this time invested in the game and it was wasted.  Just keep this in mind that if you invest too much time and/or money in this game you will eventually become aggravated....just my opinion but if you check out the game forums you will see the issue discussed and still no resolution.",2
Horny's comments are by far the best part that and the shinys. MUWHAHAHA,4
Fun game and reminds me of 5he computer game but hate the push notifications.  I close the game that should be it,3
Just not like the classic game i remember,3
Your dungeon heart beckons for attention....muahahahaha,5
This app is a good way to waste the time,5
Love the pc version but this seems a little pricey EA,5
This game is awsome,5
Love it,5
"This game definitely sucks you in. It's a lot of fun, but I find time escaping me while I play it.",4
Not bad so far? It just keeps nagging me to rate it...lol,4
I loved DK 2 and this one is great substitute for my smart phone,5
"while supercell is launching several games with great graphics ,quick loadtime, versatility to use pens with platforms like Samsung Note phones  and Samsung Pro tablets. DK is dragging it's heels with slow matchups, long troop building times, constant graphic glitches ,and  EXCESSIVE load up time . The only reason i keep playing is to maintain my base that i spent so much time building. Electronic Arts ,you can do so much better but apparently you just don't care with this game !",3
"Nice, but annoying",3
It's a garbage cashin,1
Small problem with checking for update requiring multiple restarts but the game does recapture a lot of the classic dungeon master game,4
"Was a great game, but ever since an update last week it's just not opening. I get attacked and can't even defend my self. I lose my money and time and cc in game money.... I would like to be reimbursed on the coins I've lost in game from attacks, I'm sure you can do that at lease. once complete and working great again I'll move 1* to a 5* and reverse this message. Thank you, I deleted  this  game 3 days  ago and  I was  spent money  üíµ. On this game what a waste. I still  haven't seen and responds on anyone",1
Free to wait,1
Fun game,5
I let my phone sit for almost 2 hours as game checked for updates and progress bar never moved.,1
After the latest update. It does not want to load. Need to be fixed. I'm on Android.,2
Love this game has a hard time loading on the new phone but I'm going to keep trying,4
It would be nice if the game would load so I could actually play.,1
This game is interesting but having to check for updates every time I log into the game is annoying.,3
Digital debauchery,5
"Good fun game while it works.  Worked for a few days then won't load.  No mute setting also a tad annoying.  Try it! If it works enjoy, if not, I warned you.",2
It would be 5 stars but has a horrible time getting stuck on checking for updates screen.,3
Awsome,5
"Great game but now whenever I try to open it it just says ""checking for updates"" and won't load.",1
"Two days ago, started locking up at the ""checking for updates"" screen and will not start.",1
But need some work. Crashing and levels not updating properly. Upgrade my gold and stone and defense still in the same level cursor. Its freaking annoying. Submit a complain to get fixed.. No response.   Too expensive for gems. But need patience. Still.playing.,4
Just wanted to say thanx to EA for mutilating one of my favorite games.,1
This is a cheap attempt to make money from fans of the old dungeon keeper. It doesn't come close to the indepth of the pc game and it is prone to glitches and bad programming. If you liked the old DK don't bother hoping this will fill the gap it left in your heart. It will only give you heartburn,2
Game on Android is now deader than Julius Caesar.  Stuck at opening screen trying to load updates.,2
Love the game but recently been having a hard time logging in,5
Need to fix the update part have to keep force closing for it to connect,5
"My game frezzes on the checking for updates i have to reinstall the whole thing every time i play, u guys need to fix this",3
"Outstanding game, reminiscent of the original Dungeon Keeper. A must have for RTS fans.",5
"Looks good, but has only loaded up once or twice. Always stuck at ""Checking for updates"". Fix might involve restarting app a dozen times, though might just be coincidence. Neither CoC nor any other app has ever had this kind of connection problem.  No error message or description and no steps for resolution means its incompetent software that doesnt even know or care if it works.",1
Not working after the last update stuck on the loading page. Galaxy Note edge,3
Just sits on the loading screen.,1
"After having my first dungeon deleted, including purchased gems, and never hearing anything from EA. I'm done. Besides that, fun game except that when a single flying champion can lay waste to your entire dungeon its obvious a pay to win game. I've spent over 100 dollars on gems for imps and it makes absolutely no different when opponents simply dig through walls or fly over them with a next to unkillable unit. To call this dungeon keeper is a slap in the face to the fans of the original game. Uninstalling.",1
Fun game. Addictive,5
Love the throwback done fresh üòä,4
Needs more imps! The touch ui has some calibration issues i think. But fun stuff,4
I bought some gems to get a free Imp well I got the gems but no Imp! Please fix,5
The game does not suck I just got bored of it but it wont let me delete it if u think u might delete this app do not download,1
Better than Clash or other PvP games,5
"Well its a great game overall, reminiscent of it's awesone PC predecessors.  But it's also a money grubber and there are unrealistic time frames for imps to accomplish things...days and weeks versus hours.",3
wont load  have to completely shut my phone down and restart to play for just a few minutes,4
"This is only superficially similar to the original PC game, making it very, very disappointing for me.  It takes far too long to reach an interesting level of play, with most critters, rooms and stuff locked behind PvP combat for points.  Save yourself the download time, this ain't worth it.",1
"Awesome little game, fantastic commentaries! cute little game, play it! :) Except this last update seems to lock up the loading and f it and I cant play at all now :( fix it please!",4
Can not get in the game it won't load and can't delete the game,1
Good,5
Played original. This ones good too! 5 stars. Note 5,5
Update the update!,5
Nothing like the PC game and too hard to win,1
This has positives and negatives to it. It is very similar to the old PC game which I love but in the old game you were able to buy imps without an issue as long as you had the money. You could fortify your walls and build things without issue and without it taking forever. You could quickly build your dungeon and summon new creatures. I really wish they didn't require you to spend real money buying gems inorder to purchase your imps and build your dungeon. I may be deleting this soon. :-(,3
"This game is a whole heap of fun! I never find myself really waiting on building timers, because the wholesale destruction of other players keeps me pretty busy. It's definitely the mobile style version of the original. So if you're a fan of the PC version, like me, then it only adds to the enjoyment of a game that's already very enjoyable.",5
Love  it !,5
This game crashes frequently and i play it on a nice tablet.  The last time it crashed my dungeon was reset to the the beginning and i lost all progress and money invested. I wrote up 2 support tickets requesting help and never got a response to either request.  Worst customer service ever and a compleat waste of money!!!!,1
Game,5
Good stuff played the originals back in the 90s nice to see em back,4
"Sticking with the theme theses days.. How do you ruin good games? Simple, just port them to smart phone and make them cash shop timer games..",1
Anti virus recognized this app as malware. No issues with many other games...,1
Imps are too expensive and little gets done. Assign a task then come back the next day type of game.,3
"I love games that embrace more than heroics, but get ready to repeat, repeat, repeat...also...offline mode?",4
Its a simple cash grab that takes hours for a imp recharge or to mine 1 dirt block,1
"Make the Imps cheaper, the build times a little less and back off the PVP-CENTRIC nature of the game (not all bad but more solo would be great).  Also, get a positive for Adware from AVG.",3
"This is a great game, I would have given it 5 stars but it has a habit of losing connection after playing for a half hour or so. Still it's worth the trouble of restarting the game to reconnect to the server... I just can't stop slapping those lazy impsüòºüëãüëøüôäüéÉ",4
It was okay.,4
It's sucks,1
"For all of its blatant shaking you down for dollars, it is a good reload of the original, though I miss having  Heros to terrorize.",3
You average base defense browser/app game with better humor.,3
This game has a lot of in app purchases,4
"Awesome game, played it years ago and now again!",5
"But wait till your fifth, then wait for the two for one sale.",5
Not a bad game at all! üíÉ,5
Great game fun and even a little addictive,4
Good,4
I changed my rating to two stars after a year and a half the game is purely pay to win..gotta make the investors happy right? I won't be coming back to this I miss the old DK this game is a terrible representation of the old game.,2
Simply fun!.,5
Fun game,5
You like paying real money to play a stupid game? Me neither.,1
"I remember playing g dungeon keeper 2 back in the nineties when I was, like, 9. Didn't know it was tower defense, which might be why I never won, but I loved playing it anyway. The app is fantastic, a few changes on how it used to be, but overall great. It's not pay to win, but I will say it's pay to win faster. However, I haven't sunk a penny into this game and I'm still kicking butt in it! If you're patient and don't mind waiting out the build times for traps, rooms, and minions, you're set! 5/5 stars! &lt;3",5
Certainly keeps you busy! One of the better tower-like defense games I've played in a while. It requires actual strategy :p,5
Some things take too long,3
Awesome,5
"My dungeon disappeared along with the five dollars i spent to get the ""free imp"". The support section is completely useless and don't expect any customer support either because nobody will respond to your requests. This game will steal your money and you won't even be able to play it. Seriously don't waste your time.",1
Nice game,5
Good time for the phone,5
Just like old times.,5
Would give five if you could give the imps a list of stuff to do. Like digging it would be nice to be able to have them dig and keep digging while  I'm sleeping or working,4
Entertaining,5
"Love this game, a lot of fun",4
Fun,5
only loads once. then freezes. have to uninstall and reinstall. üòí,2
Tower deffence meets Town builder. And you get to slap the work force when they upset you.,5
Great,4
"Awesome game, used to have a copy for Win95. Nostalgia is strong. :) Gfx settings would be awesome so I could adjust to play on a lower end device! Not worth taking away a star for, but I would buy some gems as a thank you if it popped up. ;)",5
Just started playing it and its fun but imps seem a tad expensive,4
1.fpp 2.drag 3.edit layout,3
As a mobile game this is awesome. If your someone who's going to complain about the micro transactions you need to realize that this is how developers want to make their money. Game really reflects the original DK. Great alternative to COC. Well build and designed.,5
My favorite game!  Easy to advance without spending a lot of money.,5
"Fun, but the waiting is annoying.  Yeah, you can pay to bypass the waiting.... But then the game becomes super expensive.  EDIT:  was thinking about buying some gems to grab another monster, but suddenly, the cost jumped from 500 gems to 1100 gems.  Total rip-off.  I won't be spending any money on this game because of this....",1
This game is really really good and different and different is really good,5
"Ai sucks. So does disconnecting randomly during raids. Nothing like losing because all your stuff goes the wrong direction for no reason, or because you were disconnected or had an error with a minute left on the clock",1
"They will actually stole my money... When i didn't get the free imp with purchase I wasn't too upset and asked that they just add the imp. Many emails were sent with no reply.. They reset my base people.. Day one, brand new?? This is how they respond to a technical issue o.O do yourself a favor spend nothing if u play this. It was a great one until they got me up the butt",1
I have played the original dungeon keepers and this game destroys what the original games were. Just sad,1
"Got up to level 52, somehow lost everything. 3 years gone.",1
"Used to enjoy this game a lot, but the lack of incentives & rewards for playing & repetitious grind of leveling dungeon has made me lose interest in game.",3
"Reminds me of Clash of Clans so far. Hopefully I won't run into the ""off-balance match-up"" problem I had with that game. Amusing, entertaining and challenging. Worth the time to download.",4
I like the game play. But it does remind me of tim curry all the time. Its a little simple but still very fun.,4
"This game is fun as is but you quickly  have to walls as a free player,  so much so that it becomes impractical to play.",3
"Just like the classic, finally back. Wheeeeee!",5
It's a nice homage to the original game.,4
to the original DK each time you fight it reminds you go premium,2
Make this like pc version,1
Game will never get connection all it says is connecting and then just goes to my main screen,1
Before purchase game was fine. After purchase I'm constantly being disconnected from server. Kind of fishy,1
Fun!,5
Love this game but I've played it before and had 5 imps unlocked and was at a fairly high level just wish it would have saved my progress so I didn't have to start all over but other than that one of my favorite games by far.,4
"Tons of funs, yes the in app purchasing is somewhat of a pain but with a little patience everything gets done.",5
I found it to be fun and addictive. Holy time killer!,5
You can tell that the developers have a sense of humor,5
Slow building and upgrades/unlocks. But I enjoy the relaxed strategies applied by others similar to chess in military minds... Fun stuff,4
"It seems to take forever to get anywhere, but its fun",4
Love this game. It is a lot like any other builder game but troops are ready way faster,5
Program gets lost then returns to loading screen and lagging is an issue . But while frustrating at times it can still be fun if you have the time.,4
Reminds me of the PC version. Thanks for the great game.,5
This game is awesome loved it on pc and now i can take it with me everywhere i go,5
"I love the art, voices, slapping imps! Designing dungeons always fun. Can't give it full five star because I have to completely 're make my army after EVERY raid. Even when I have not used a minion I still have replace him. This can be avoided at cost of gems of course. Pain staking waiting for new army before every raid...",4
OMG!THIS IS THE BEST,5
No problems so far,5
Absolutely,5
Awesome,5
This game is so fun and its addictive,5
Demands to much money Cuz it took an existing game and wrecked it with all the costs I used to love Dkeeper,1
You can get overkill murdered with random pvp lol. Also game lags a bit on my galaxy core. Thanks for a good game.,4
So reminds me of the old pc version,5
"Loads of fun, creative and all around good game",5
"Doesn't matter what you do with your dungeon, a higher level player will come along with spells or monsters you can't yet defend against. Monsters flying through dungeon rock? Check. Monsters that can dig in 2 seconds what takes you 4 or 24 real world hours to dig? Check. You will waste time thinking you can get ahead defensively but you never will because they unleash human players against you that are much higher level and stupid enough to put money into the game to mess with you.",1
It keeps saying that they have a code 7 server error!!!!!,1
Great game! Thanks for bringing this one back,5
"I like this game, but I don't like everytime when I accidentally touch the screen the temps be breaking down walls that I don't want to be broken down. Can y'all make a mode for demolishing to make a new rooms? Or just pretty safety button, until we want to demolish?",3
"Would be great if the game didn't constantly kick me out of raids or battles causing me to lose, EVERYTIME.",2
One of my favorite old school pc games...,5
Freemium,1
"This is a small amount of the original games.  It's a tower defense and raid version of dk.  The only thing that I have been in the game forever 20 years.  This is not replacing the original 1,2,or 3. By no means.  Please let me tell you how to make sure that you can get a chance to get in trouble with any other dk remake.  I will take care of render in the act of rip off style add to the center of the game.",5
Love games like this five stars thumbs up,5
"Artwork is perfect. Smallish play area, but it looks like it should take plenty of time before that becomes an issue. Thanks EA?  ;)",5
Really ea really you ruined the original game with this,1
Bone snapping fun!,5
Fun but looks like it may be a money pit not too far down the corridor,4
FUN 4 all,5
Well what more do you want,4
Cool game,5
Another cheese attempt to make yet another free -ium game.  Only this time at the expense of a well done classic.  Why don't people just pay what it is worth up front and enjoy the game without ads or some cheap ploy at pay as you go.,1
Great graphics easy to play.,5
i really liked the original this is like a demo version but still really fun in a war and creative freedom way. think labrynth,3
Looks really good can't wait till I get to a hire level.                                                                      I like the new changes they have made now it is more interesting to see the rest of dungeon keeper,4
"I'm seriously enjoying this game, absolutely my favorite to play",5
Just started but very fun!,4
"The game is a very well thought out adaptation of the original dungeon keeper, love it!",5
"Had trouble loading at first but it's working fine, pretty fun, I'll play it for a while.",5
Not anything like the old dungeon keeper...,2
"I have played this once and for a good while...and its a solid game its like boom beach in the sense that you can only attack in certain spots, also it has solid VOs and a good premise. My problems are the micro transactons and the fact that you are just facing off with other villans and not heros, maybe have the villan faceoffs be a tournament instead and the story mode be raid villages, and use the heros for cheep labor with the imps so you dont have to use jems to get help...but they die in 3 days",4
BEST GAME EVER,5
Fun and additive!,5
Good,5
Love it,4
It's cool but getting new imps is hard so can you bring the price down to make it  easier to boy them,5
Micro transactions kill this games fun and playability.,1
very good,5
Cool,5
You asked for a rating too early.,4
"If you're looking for the Dungeon Keeper experience from the excellent games of PC days past, this is not it. Once again, mobile game designers have found a way to hobble a perfectly fine game with micro transactions, timers, and arbitrary, excessively long timers. On the plus side, the graphics and voice acting are both pretty good.",2
It has no game play you wait ten hours  to get one pice of land out,1
"In one hand you have a game full of charm with curious potential. In the other EA is barely supporting the title, and bugs still exist to the degree of having too many friends making your game crash.",1
I only have the second one for PC but I loved it so I'm trying this one :),5
As a fan of the original Dk games. This makes me hsppy. This is the app I've w a item for.,5
Pretty good but should let you build a customized map layout for battles. Without having to dig,4
"It's good to be the Keeper... But since the newest update, I've been unable to open the game.... Problem fixed. Thanks",5
"Love everything about this one. The announcer is great, the sadistic humor is perfect and it's got a refreshing layer of tactical nuance. Build times are even uniquely well balanced.",5
"Great game, addictive",5
"Some pay to play, but get around it with some patience.",4
Thank you for making this game...,5
I loved dungeon keeper and now i have to wait a day or pay 2 dollars to mine a single block. No.,1
I loved this one since i was a child...,5
One of the best games I've played would be 5star if didn't kick me from raid while I'm raiding and frequent reloads,4
"Great game, but way to expensive",5
Your game sucks. Too many paywalls. How can people give 5 stars for this??,1
This its by far the best game I have played in a long time its  hard to find a good game now days try this one you will like it,5
"In my opinion, it's a great concept. The graphics are decent, and who doesn't want to slap Imps?",5
Great game!,5
The best game ever seen and heard of,5
Almost like the original. .fun..entertaining. ..play first before wasting your money,4
It's trying really hard to be a reskinned clash of clans with really bad matchmaking a high level keeper can raid a very low level one with no restrictions,3
"Good fun, lots of strategic thinking to be successful.",5
Great game graphics and interactive game play,5
Would like to see some solo/traditional game play,3
Great reminder of the classic.,5
This is so cool i love this game so much,5
"Enjoyable mechanics reminiscent of Clash of Clans, but with a greater emphasis on strategic pathing and troop placement. Budget your gem use, and spend carefully.",4
Great game hands down only problem   is if a leader kicks everyone out of the guild everything those people donated should be taken away from that guild me and 49 other made that specific guild reach perk 40 and 2 weeks later kicks everyone and closes the guild keeping all our hard work,5
Enjoying it so far,5
this game rocks,5
"It's a decent pay-to-play game, but it only has a small fraction of what made Dungeon Keeper great.",3
"Dungeon Keeper was a great game on the PC years ago, and this update for mobile has the same hilariously evil feel and game play. Sadly it's loaded down with an egregious energy system that limits you to playing for ten minutes or so each day unless you pay through the nose.",1
No a bad game only complaint really is that the build times get way to long way to fast,4
I had a tablet and loved this game for computer I was excited to download it then I got a virus from it and nothing worked now I have a new tablet and so I'm afraid to install it I really want to tho,1
Love the concept fun game,5
Would be great it the game didn't pester me to spend more and more money.,4
Very well designed and great mechanics as well as a short download and great art work.,5
Love it,5
"If it won't stop updating, clear up space or keep on eye on your app caches and clear appropriately. Not pay to win, it is a fair game.",5
"The game is playing well on my tablet. Could use reference to the trainer after he gives the intro, to 'walk-through' something again",3
"The game looks nice, but some of the challenges (Reinforc e d Walls) are not breathable, so you can't unlock everything. Also, your attacked by players about every five minutes, which is just annoying and makes it incredibly difficult to gather resources, or even log in! (Can't log in when being attacked).",1
Very funny and fun game.,5
Had game on PC. Not exact but still fun,5
Disconnect issue resolved. Now has poor framerate. At least game is playable,3
alsom lol,5
With Dungeon Keeper twist... nice job.,4
Its alright ... but its not like the original though :(,5
Good game alittle slow at first but I'm sure it will pick up. Ron,4
"I played DK on my PC many years ago,it is excited when I know it back",5
"Not as good as the PC version, but still fun to play. Would rather less PVP and more missions.",4
Best game ever,5
Can't get ahead.  They keep changing the game.  More levels.  Stronger guys.  It pay or parish.,1
Love  it,5
Needs to be updated the game keeps shutting down ... It says please wait while your imps get your dungeon in Oder then exits the game,3
This game kills time and it is really well made it is fun I really recommend To download it to give it a try,5
"Has serious update issues, wants to re-download 52MB multiple times a day, and even then that stalls and restarts. Has  patching issues. Tried for days and won't work. Super frustrating. Once you're in it's stable, unlike what other reviewers are saying. Great game!",5
Terrible,1
Finally a decent game,3
I use to play this game for the PC and I'm glade they brought it to the app store cuse it's truly the best game ever,5
Interesting challenges and fun to smack imps,4
Had this in its original form,5
One of my Favorite!,4
Just that fun enough to play a little at a time,4
"Like the PC game, only faster.",5
I loved this game on PC and having it on mobile is even better,5
This is the bast game.I loved this game so much.,5
Not to terribly hard to get the hang of,4
This is a game of slow consistent improvements over time.  Don't expect to quickly level up.,4
Love this game,5
This is a great game and you will think so to,5
Fun game,5
Just another version of coc.....ugh.  pay to win.  Lame.  Uninstalled.,2
Awesome,5
Its an addictive game,5
Loved the original and love this one too,5
"It is pretty good for a pay-to-progress type game, but I'd prefer that it just have an up-front cost and then not be designed around wasting time.",3
My wifi is working well.  Can't connect to the server to play the game. Lame.,1
Wish I was able to have a bit more control over minions,4
Cannot describe it.,5
WOOOOOOOOOH,4
Fun game but pay to win build gets old fast.,4
Great game mechanics. Fun story and excellent long term playability.,5
Used to play DK2 on the pc and loved it. This is very close and fun to play,5
Wish it was more like the PC versions and also wish it didn't make you try to spend real money but fun and decent for a free phone game fo sho :),5
My fave game on android,5
Keeps closing please fix,2
"This game reminds me of the old classic Dungeon Keeper on the PC. The whole build your own dungeon is still the same, but the waiting part is a bit of a pain. If you like the 1996 Dungeon Keeper you'll like the app.",4
"To many updates, 3+ times a day, uninstalling...Loved the game, but to frustrating!",5
It's a game,5
Fun till you meet Tiny. Tiny is a gem only (premium currency)hero dragon that flys and is reusable (unless he is knocked out in a dungeon you can chain raid with him nonstop) he is also for some reason strong enough to destroy a dungeon solo. As he can fly (flying in a dungeon) he can pass through walls and is immune to floor traps and to top it off  he has a ton of health so what air defenses you do have will not stop tiny. You will see him often  (All the time),1
"In the past year a new developement team has made major huge strides in debugging this game.  Load times are now only a few seconds, and disconnects are uncommon.  This past week they have even corrected the scoring system for tournaments.  At this point, I would recommend the game to anyone!",5
Once again Google has taken a game from the pc world and made it their own so they can make money. The fact that they limit your building capacity  and you have to buy your imps after the two free ones is one example. Its just not the same game after Google gets their hands on it. But all in all its a good game. Leave your cc in your wallet you wont need it.,4
Super fun,5
"Ea, you ruined this game you greedy people. Would give this 0 stars but I cant. You're lucky.",1
It just like hell,5
Fun butt,4
I remember playing this game on pc back in 1999 on my sister computer. Im so happy that EA brought it to Google play,5
I love the idea of putting this old title on mobile. Dungeon keeper is a classic. They did a great job rebuilding it. My only issue is I don't like the Facebook feel,4
Love it,5
I couldnt play when i had 3 but now i have 5 and its ammmazing hope u make a sequel!,4
I really enjoyed the original Dungeon Keeper series. I am glad to see the title brought back.,5
Awesome,5
Crashes,1
A good game but can't replace the classic,4
Every day is a good day when I get to b*tch slap my minions. Lol.,5
The sly charm of this title works with the satisfaction of seeing you home grow ever more productive and deadly.,5
Love it brings back to the days  on pc,5
A little disappointed in what is needed for more imps,4
This game is as close to Dungeon Keeper of is going to get. I really enjoyed playing this game.,5
"I love the game but i feel that the flying creatures are a bit unfair when they are used on players who dont/cant have the anti-defense unlocked yet to defend against them. Either the dungeon heart level to unlock the trap needs to be lowered to at least 5 or 6, or seperate out the player raid leagues based on how far along they are in the gameplay and not just ranks/level",3
"It's a lot of fun, the humor is pretty good, and it's nice to be able to play a bad person for a change.",5
It is awesome I love how it says when you were attacked.,5
Fun so far.,5
Nice game play and adictive,5
Make an updated version that has more stuff,2
reminds me of the old dungeon keeper on pc,5
Loved it as a kid and loving it even more now,5
It's so great I have it on my mamaws tablet and my tablet and know my phone please get this app please do it just do it,5
Highly relaxing yet a great challenge as it is fun,5
In like clash of clans you can test your defences. You can also make the trail longer to waste time on attackers. Dragons are also the strongest troop in like clash of clans I love dragons and there my favorite creature.,5
It's OK pay to win is meh,3
Fun game but you'll need a top end processor on your device to play.,4
No way,1
Great time passer and very fun,5
Not as great as pc game but pretty good.,5
Worth the download takes time to get used to cause not like clash or samuria siege grafics much better,5
Used to work fine. Now it doesn't load. I can see my dungeon. But my imps apparently can't get it in order haha,2
Looks nice but doesn't live up to the legendary original from 1997. The tutorial is lots of bla bla with little in info. As the tutorial was over I didn't really know what I was supposed to do now. There was no necessity for any changes to the original master piece. Don't fix what isn't broken!!!!  EA screwed this up big time!!! Blasphemy!!!! Shame on you!!!,1
Love the game reminds me of the old 90's game can't get enough of this game been playing for a few years now the updates are awesome thanks guys and happy New Year,5
Brrroooo this game is wats up fammm I feel like a real thug now homeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,5
Like it lots,5
"Don't bother downloading, this port of your Favorite Dungeon RPG. It's crappy programming is sure to rob you of your Precious Gems. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GIVE THEM ANY MONEY!",1
Haven't played it long enough to love it. It's fun.,4
Except have to wait way to long to play. Chill on the wait time.,5
Good times. Obviously pushes freemium platform. Odd bugs. But enjoyable progress at lower levels. Would be interested in a similar game that is paid up front... no freemium model.,4
"If you've ever played the classic Dungeon Keeper games, you'll see early on that this isn't anything like them. This is a multiplayer tower defense variant built on that ever-popular premise that if you make a game needlessly tedious, players will pay to make it less so. You can spend $100 on enough gems to make this game not boring and tedious, or you can get a *good* Dungeon Keeper game for your PC for just $5. Not a hard choice to make.",1
Like the PC dungeon keeper.  .....kinda.     still a close recreation of the classic.,5
Simple but fun,4
I absolutely love the snarly back-talk! The most fun  I've had in ages!  This game seems to get better with every update! Well done!!,5
Fun,5
Funny and exciting,5
"EXTREMELY GREEDY, wait times and upgrade prices either make you pull out your hair, or spend your whole pay check on the game, i am now bald",3
I'd have this game I love it now got and app to can't what to see what's new thank you gays,5
Awesome love it,5
Minons,5
A must try game!,5
Awsome game. Loved the RTS.,5
"I really enjoy this game but unless there's an update to fix this, can't really play. Crashes to the ""loading"" page repeatedly. Very frustrating when attacking, makes me lose when I was winning. Smh",2
Remixed classic made for phones.,4
Very fun and easy love this game,5
Cool so far.,5
"Make a way to reorganize your base, like take everything up instead of moving it all one by one. Then 5 stars",4
Looks fantastic clear graphics and very fun. Please adjust resolution for galaxy view,5
Cool,5
Very fun and hard to get off my brother calls me weird but this game is fun my sister said its better than pc and then I tryed it and this game is amazing,5
There is no mechanic to stop high level players from wiping out starting players. Can't keep resources long enough to be competitive.,2
Need ways to earn imps maybe,5
Took like a year from this game because it has performance issues. I just started back and it seems to be working good now.,4
So far so good,4
Better than clash of the clans and little empire,5
Good game,4
What better way to strike terror then  to build an awesome dungeon and raid the neighbors with your creatures,5
It is a fun cute game that I can play with friends far away,4
I like I love it its amazing,5
lots of fun and allows you to relive the dungeon keeper days of old,5
Great take on a real classic. Lots of evil fun!,5
Evil fun like the original,5
"An excellent game but designed to make as much money as it can, which hinders the quality some.",4
Awsome,5
Love the app and especially the voice of encouragement from the DK,5
Love,4
Sad remake of a killer game,1
It is super super super super super super super very super awesome u should totally get it its a good game me and my dad and all the boys in my family love i and there is 5 boys in my good family and try clash of clans.clash of clans is just like dungeon kepper but better,5
I just started and I think it the best game ever,5
You can slap the imps to death.,5
Good game,4
You always have something to do and the PvP is unfair.,5
"After the awful start this game had, it's been fixed up to a point where it's actually really really fun now.",5
Unplayable because of 'loading' and connection errors. Keep losing points and minions because game disconnects during a raid. Save yourself time and frustration by waiting for the devs to fix it.,1
"I m liking this game, its different.",5
I love this game thanks for it:-)(:()¬ß==|= (:3,5
Very very slooooow,2
"Played for 1 year plus, mostly out of love for original dungeon keeper. Ea ruined this game, from gameplay to connection problems. Finally deleted after multiple reinstalls, lag, etc. If you loved the original, Dont waste your time.....",1
Always loved this game,4
"Tells me if I put my google acc, I get free gems. I do it and automatically changes my dungeon to my old one. Now I have to start over",1
It can be a bit challenging at first but with cave in feature new players will not be constantly crushed. Love that I broke my other tablet and when I reinstalled did not lose anything.,5
"This game is great! That being said I feel like doing a critical review of what I don't like about the game. The two biggest flaws of the game would be the very long load times for raids/attacks and the very frequent loading errors forcing you to retry an attack. Those coupled together can take 5-10 minutes to finally play the game, other games it takes less then a minute. Lastly the game doesn't have a map editor so redesigning your dungeon is tedious and frustrating. Still, gameplay is awesome.",3
Awesome game,4
"A little bit of a slow go if you don't buy gems to hurry it along, could be better.",4
Keep getting booted out of the latest survival challenge. Replaces mana but not units or traps. Looks like a server side issue...,3
Game does not load...battles do not finish,1
Good it is like king of thieves,4
Pay walls,1
I think I actually enjoy this more than clash of clans. I'm still in the beginning but what I enjoy more about it is the costomiztion of an actual dungeon! I might use some dungeon layouts in this game for when me and my friends play dungeons and dragons.,5
"Super fun, great graphics ,and it's AWESOME!",5
"Geez. What do you want ? Somebody to hold your hand and download it for you ?A reassuring voice in your ear saying,""It'll be okay. It's a good game that you'll enjoy."" Get a life. The gameplay and strategy is well thoughtout.",5
A lot of the same elements that many of these army builder type games use but EA is just the best at putting out a stable and complete product.  Good job guys,5
The game looks really fun and I really want to play it but the game wont even start please fix it,1
It has its own storyline and allows you to test your dungeon!,5
Love it. It's like a kiddyfied version of what my dad used to play. I love the addition of Horny xD,5
When i barely open da game it says searching for updates and it stays like dat and nothing happens please fix it i wanna play da game,1
Just like on pc,4
Takes me back to the good old days of playing dungeon keeper on the pc. Oh the nostalgia!,5
"As someone who player the original game on PC, I do find that this one falls slightly short in terms of charm and humor.  I'm hoping that just means it has room to grow.  Definitely not a bad game.",4
Loving it a lot of fun,5
So many bugs,2
Awesome,5
"You need to add a countdown for the cave-in counter though, I never know when I have it or when it ends.",5
!!!AWESOME!!!,5
"Connection frequently get dropped, which means you lose the battle, mana and minions you used. This has been an issue for a long time. Make it less connection dependent  UPDATE: minions sometimes freeze in the middle of nowhere",1
Nuff said.,5
ITS THE BEST GAME EVER IT PLAYS WELL AWSOME GRAPHICS TO IT IS SUCH THE BEST GAME EEEVVVVEEEERRRR!!!!!!!!!üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ,5
Game stops working all the time.,1
I had the original games on my pc. I'm thrilled to finally play it again.,5
Reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper games from back in 95-98.,5
"I installed and tried to do initial open, but it only crashes",1
Saw the title got excited since I used to play the computer game dungeon keeper 2 when I was a kid and loved it..... This game got my hopes up that I could play it again but sadly all it does is use the general look of the old characters in a clash of clans version of the original game. Wish they would have made it more like the computer game,2
Slow to load. Good graphics. Game is still improving over time. Recommended for play.,4
Fun game highly recommend ! Get this game,5
"Everything so far has been awesome. Only problem is when you zoom out too far, and maybe it's only with my phone, but it starts to glitch and then the screen freaks out. Otherwise, it brings me back to my teen years playing the original on PC. Thanks guys for bringing back a classic game and making it just as fun as the original.",4
Pretty awesome,5
"Is so so, hard to play on small screens but its ok",4
"Why does everyone hate on this game? Its just like any game, if you want to have fun you have to be prepared to pay for it, duh.",5
All out fun Game.,5
What I like about Dungeon Keeper is it makes me feel very powerful and I love to build and 57 people so will you come up with new one soon I believe in you,1
Nice job,5
It's not like the pc version has its own phone game style with restrictions sounds horrible but it's ok I guess,3
"This is not good for retro gamers. If you have ever played the original, you would know EA has butchered the game.",1
Loving it so far,5
Sweet!,5
Still early days but so far so good. Brings me back to when I had this on pc.,5
Free to play model ruins it. Id  pay a high price for full capability. Guess you still want to just cash grab.  Unlock it all and make it fun.,1
"Every time I try this game again, it never stops disappointing me. Such a fun game with so many bugs. See you in a next year maybe...",1
"After the recent update many people, myself included, have been getting stuck on the ""checking for updates"" screen. I have been able to access my account the past few day, and my rating will return to 5 stars if the consistency keeps up.",3
I've been playing a while and enjoy the game however last few days I have problems loading the game. Usually it gets stuck on checking for updates even after I tried reinstalling.,5
"With continual updates and fresh challenges, the developer hasn't given up on this classic game and neither has its fans. Just enough fun with a burst of exciting game play without getting sucked into hours of mind numbing lack of progression.",5
Constantly searches for update without finding any.,1
Great game. And they keep making it better.... love the latest updates. :),5
Great,5
"I have been playing for a while and had never lost a defense raid then all of a sudden people with the dragon immortal and wraith a show up and I still have the ability to build no defense against them. Poor balancing, make air defense available earlier.",1
I've enjoyed this game since it was on PC it's always been a favorite... but now I'm having difficulty getting past the initial screen even after restarting and reloading everything. Please please fix soon? Will totally give five stars. But it's hard to rate a game you can't play and frustrating because the download took forever and it's a chunk of memory I can't use for other things.,2
Great game just won't load most of the time. Would rather play something that works...,1
Love it,5
It seems to lock up frequently if anything in the background interferes like a notice from text or anything like that. Other than that it seems pretty awesome.,5
its so much better than castle crashers if i did not have to uninstall and reinstall it every time i want to play it.,3
"No longer loads. Stuck at downloading update ever since. Have tried clearing cache,  etc",1
"I wish that the notifications used my phone's default notification tone rather than one unique to the game. I like being notified when a building is done or something like that, but I had to disable them because of the demon talking to me from my pocket.",4
I like the style of game kinda like CoC,5
"Ever since the last update I can't play it.  Either my tablet restarts, it says the imps are getting you dungeon in order, or it just loads.  This is getting VERY annoying",2
"Great game, but since the latest update the game won't load. Loading screen gets stuck on 'connecting'",1
"Its nice to customize your dungeon and smack imps around. Having some loading issues, game stays on update screen and doesnt load sometimes",5
First I couldn't get it past the checking for updates screen then I tried to re download it and it won't install now. I have put alot of time into the game and even some money. Not happy!!!,1
Pretty awesome just learning ins and outs,5
Pay to play slow action but it's still fun if your not in a hurry,4
This game is awful it can take up to 24 hours to mine certain blocks.This is a souless attempt to get in on that clash of clans money.I feel bad for the people that rated it five stars They probably don't know anything about the original,1
I use to play this game on my computer quite a few years ago. I still love it,5
"I enjoyed playing this game when it was working. Now I got recently got a Samsung S5, I noticed after the first few days of playing Dungeon Keeper, it won't even load properly on my phone.  It seems to stay on a screen saying checking for updates. As a result, I can't play the game on my device.",1
Hooked me,5
This is bs love the game!! stuck at loading screen never happens to me would love to play please fix ot tell me how 2..,1
Love  the  game  but  always  loaded slow . Now it will  not  Load at all. So that's  why  I  give  one  star .,1
"The app just says ""checking for updates"" and won't proceed to game so now I can't play. I've cleared the game cache settings but, do I have to uninstall completely?",4
Every time I load the game it stops at the title checking for updates. This is on both my phone and tablet.,2
Why did you update this game and not fix any bugs!?! Still broken from the 6/1/2015 update. Asus memo pad fhd 10. I've spent over 40$ in-game purchases. You owe me a WORKING game!!!,1
"If you have played the original just keep scrolling past this one. Besides it being nothing like the original hit game this app crashes or won't load constantly. Good luck even getting through the tutorial. One extra star for title and concept, minus 3 for fallibility and turning it into a kids tower defense...",2
"I Played this game for a very long time and was able to overlook all the problems at first, but now it has locked me out and is clearly broken. The game says its looking for updates and wont even open. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and done all i can. I give up.......",1
Both new phone abs new tablets load it then n says looking for updates. You hit exit it says it will pause update but after 5 minutes it has loaded nothing. ...,1
Its a pretty good game,5
Much better now! Very good looking,4
They seem to be having issues lately and there is no feedback to explain why the screen appears stuck.  I couldn't play for days.,3
Great game with a few bugs still needing work,3
Great game,4
"Can't seem to log on anymore, it just stays stuck on the loading/update screen. This needs to be fixed fast!",1
Title says it all. This is a free phone version of a pc classic with micro transactions sprinkled in because EA.,4
So after enjoying this game for a short while (level 22) and spending my money on it as well..the game does not load anymore ..another rip off game don't waste ur time or money,1
"Always remains on the connecting screen searching for updates and nothing, it's been like this for an hour straight and still no progress....",1
"game does not want to load constantly says checking for updates please fix, getting tired of unistalling and reinstalling it",2
"Love the game.  Been addicted since the beginning.  How can I play, or rate, a game that doesn't open anymore?",1
"It says connecting and never does anything else. Ive play this before though and it dosent impress me. I love the orignal DK for the PC, i guess it was just a let down when i started this up and its nothing like the real DK.",1
Good game but after level 4 heart starts locking up and locking you out of raids. After level 5 heart locks up trying to load in to just slap your imps. Fix these load issues and would be almost as fun as original. But....as it is right now I can't play a game that is not reliable. Have fun storming the castle.,2
It is a good game,5
I haven't played in 3 Years and can't restart please add it,4
Still fun after a couple years.,3
"Cool concept, hits a wall of inactivity very quickly.",2
So hot it's cool,5
"I'd give 5th star if it granted me another imp. Running it on HTC desire 612, loading times seem frozen and laggy. I don't bother with multitasking when this game is running, it does cause my phone to freeze up. Maybe a Gfx option for low end devices- instead of actual characters, just a floating icon like 4x game speed does, and turn off some of the animations(creatures wondering about dungeon, attack animations from buildings).Game is fun and I'll continue playing,I just hope EA doesn't neglect this one",4
I was looking to play DK2. This isn't like the PC game i played a long time ago.,3
This is a free to play. But it is a pay to win. I think it would be better if you didn't have to pay for the pvp win streaks. Also the pvp match ups could use a little work. For example if I'm not high enough to have anti air attacks. Then I should not have to worry about a player attacking me using an air attack. These air just the fist thoughts. Feel free to contact me for other pointers.,4
This isnt the dungeon keeper I grew up with. Thanks for ruining happy memories EA,1
No bugs,5
Great graphics. Good game.,5
Great game brings me back to to old computer game,5
Dk,5
"Played it for 10 mins and realized it's just another cash machine disguised as a nostalgic game. Deleted it and went to GOG and downloaded the real one for five bucks. Yeah it's an old dos game but this app's grandfather still shines better then this. This app along with countless others is listed under my ""never download again"" file.",1
Good,5
Having a blast learning and playing this one.,5
Since its ea there are microtransaction if your playing as a sequel to the first game i dont reccomend it but as a game its ok,3
Best game ever i play it every day,5
It's similar to original game but the cost in gold etc is kind of high. I understand the need money to continue to develop it but I dislike being able to only play for limited time before I either spend or stop.,3
Was expecting something more like the old computer game. Still fun albeit cartoony.,4
E.A. is so bad that they don't even look at there people who commented and all they care about is 5 stars... and they just don't do anything about it... and they are also money hogers because even imps cots gems and all the E.A. WANT YOU TO PAY MONEY SO THEY CAN SAY THANK YOU FOR THE CASH NOW WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU NOW LEAVE... E.A. if you make the imps like probably 50 gems each then that's good but going beyond that... and if you read this comment then good for you E.A....,1
I'm an original player of the pc version. Sometimes the game is fairly time consuming. But its a favorite! Only problem is I know no one that plays it haha,5
Great game and very addictive,5
Looks little thief with more on dungeon design than stealing,4
This is a great game. Very fun and very addicting. Just one problem... You get a massive win streak going and it decides to crash halfway through a fight. Thanks for that...,1
The best app if ever played,5
Not to bad its fun so y not. Lol,4
"So enjoy it except Sundays, because due to game dreads and gems earning schedules are required every Sunday; so, I could not play any game every Sunday.  :(",1
Slap all the impsüòà,5
Love this game! Remembered playing it on PC,5
After all the rants I heard it expected it to be terrible.  It's not the original by any means but it isn't the worst phone app I've played and certainly better than a lot of EA games I have bought.,4
Seems legit great builder,5
Old school pc version was the best. This crappy remake of a classic leaves me in a constant state of face palm.,1
Now that it seems to have quit crashing every 2 minutes its a great game. Very fun.,3
Reminiscent of the Facebook game,5
Really addicting,4
Updates take away some of the perks or change reward amounts.Fun game. Not as good as original PC game but good for Android app,3
Hooked from first raid,5
I enjoy this game it's a good way to get rid of your boredom,5
I can't even play it it gets to 90%and it closes on its own  its annoying,1
"A good title that will never die. I'm glad to see that the game industry care about their gamers, there's so much crappy games on the mobile market. We need real games developed by professionals. Thanks EA!",5
i like the game and i never purchased anything to speed up things. you just have to be patient if you want to play it free!,5
Didn't play it yet but I remember playing it when I was a kid!  It was awesome!,5
What a fun game this is. It could be better if you didn't have to pay so much for simple creatures like imps!!,4
This game is like clash of class but better!,5
Pay pay pay. You'll never make money like COC if you ask for money the first 10 minutes of the game. Game constantly freezes and is so slow. There's no reason to stay.,1
"This is one of my favorite games on Android no doubt, I have no complaints and I'm a pc gamer. I play this and few other game when away from pc!!",5
Great game.,5
Can't type my dungeon name,4
Really good port of the original game,5
Loved playing it back in the day still a fun game,5
There is a bug in the dungeon namer,4
"Like it. Electronic Arts should make many, many more Android-based apps. Been playing EA Games since the Atari 2600 came out !!! Keep up the good work, EA !! WE WANT MORE !!!! MORE !!!!",4
I'm a devil,5
Original owner said it stinks,1
You could get the game it is every cool,5
"After I downloaded the game I was no longer heard or able to hear anyone that called me or that I called. Also my phone will randomly restart during gameplay,  and on several occasions the game would suddenly turn into an explosion of pixels and then my phone would freeze",3
"This game started out with all the awesomeness of the original platform, and i had high hopes. But i quickly came to a point where actions are measured in hours target than minutes.     Part of the appeal of this game is the construction and design of your base, but this is lost when it takes 4 hours to dig out a level 2 square. To put this into comparison, it takes 3 seconds to dig a level 1 square. So once you invest in the ability to dig level 2 squares, you find out that it takes 4,800 times longer.",2
I find that the flying immortal unbalances the game.  Even at early levels they are unstoppable.  Seems silly to have flying units in a dungeon/maze game.  It defeats the purpose....,4
Try it out there should be more stuff to spend gold on but other wise a great game and this not a clone of any other game contrary to what people have written dungeon keeper predates any phone game but its a different kinda game compared to other,5
Yes yes yes,5
Fun time killer,4
Loved the ring tone,5
"I remember playing this for the pc when I was young, still love to play it as an adult.",5
It's ok??,4
"Keypad doesn't work. After checking fixes online, this problem has been going on for years and still hasn't been fixed? Uninstalling now.",1
Every time I open the game it is always loading when I try to attack it stops in the middle of it and says loading I lose all my progress why does a game this size have so much to load. I think the servers are over loaded. Need to update badly can't even play the game the way it is now,3
To have actual fun its a good game,5
"How many times am I supposed to be expected to play the first 3 minutes of the tutorial? Doesn't even crash,  but disconnects from the server.  This game seems to have the mobile equivalent of always-on DRM.  Yet another great franchise  ruined by a once great company.  P.S. Even if I could have stayed connected I would have uninstalled after hearing the first notification.  Are you. Kidding.  Me.  With. That. Intrusive.  Garbage.  Do not support.",1
I liked what I saw so far but the game is broken. It won't let me put in a dungeon name. Everything I try it just removed my keyboard.,2
I spend half my time on loading screens and it kicking me off the server its really annoying plz fix. Happens if im on wifi or 4g,3
I love it,5
I love this game my favorite part is when the game shuts down,1
Fun,5
I really enjoy this game.,5
Good game,5
"It's a tower defense game, very different from  the pc version. Pretty annoying the green gem money eater: if you don't want to spend money,  be ready to wait, a lot!! 3 stars, that's it. ...missing the PC version!!",3
"I used to play this on my desktop as a kid so i was psyched when i found this app. The only downside I'd have to say, is when your in a raid and it sends you back to your dungeon for no apparent reason",4
Game but flying enemy's should be nerfed,4
I like building dungeons :-),5
Great game! Addictive time killer.,5
Good game,4
Can't reastart,3
Not what I expected... Not anywhere close to offline PC version,1
Fairly entertaining.,3
This game is terrible. You slander the name of Dungeon keeper. You are nothing but a bunch of greedy people who deserves to be put in their place. I hope you guys run out of business cause of this nonsense.,1
Cool game..good graphics,5
Lags now and then,4
Need more things but not bad,4
The game is fun and easy for playing only when I have time. They have improved the user interface to make it easier to play on phones. Fixed some flaws in resource collection,4
See title.,1
Amusing..,5
"Pay to keep playing. Gem packs are as much as $100 USD, pay attention if you buy them! That's more than almost any game is worth.",1
"Game is great reminds me of the original. Only problem I feel it has it the gems like every other money hungry game app... other than that graphics are great, story is well written, and the chLlenges are to fun.",5
This is a pretty cool game not bad at all slapping minions to speed them up is funny and i got a new ring tone for free which was extremely nice,4
Great time waster,5
Very fun and very challenging game. It make u think to plan ur defense and teach u were to deployment ur armies...,5
Pay to win. Pay to play. Stick with CoC . Again for 2015.,1
The usual dull micro transaction fest. Spend real money in order to play at a reasonable rate.,1
I like the game but would like to see games like this without having to be attacked or attack other people.  Just let me play the game like the pc version of DK.,5
Very cool so far. I played long ago on my desktop but this app version is so much cooler.,5
"The game won't let me play, I load it up and once it gets to the actual game it turns off and goes to my home menu.....it's stupid",2
I have good defenses in the game,5
EA make better games.,1
EA I'm soooo disappointed in you...your servers are crap...I can't even raid anybody since every time I get raided I get shut out of the game until they are done...my imps are ALWAYS having to get my dungeon ready even when I have FULL WiFi strength!!!! RIDICULOUS!!!,1
I love this game its great I think you will like it GET IT ITS AWESOME,5
I have played the original and this hit the nail on the head,5
Great game,5
Awesome game and graphics !!!!,5
"It seem when you do the intro, then I go to enter my dungeon name whenever I press the key pad on my phone it thinks I press the back screen. I can't get a single letter in. Was an interesting game though. Please fix",2
Looks like Dungeon Keeper 2!!,5
Great free app. Game is solid & fun. Recommend to anyone to play.,5
It's a good game. Would be better if it was like the original version. Why does it take 4 hours for an imp to dig? In the original you didn't have to wait so long to get things finished. Also you didn't need gems to buy imps.,3
It got even better when I played it on a tablet,5
IT SUCKS BALLS,1
Pretty cool game. Reminds me of the good times played on the earlier versions. Thanks,4
So far pretty awesome.,5
Can't play at a certain,3
You don't get the gems back that you spend in the tutorial :(,3
Hate spending actual cash in games. Turns me off from playing them. Already hit the point where i can't advance unless i pay.,3
What the hell is with having to do a 50mb update every single time i play. Ur using up all my data!!!!,1
Well built,5
"This game is the epitome of what happens when F2P goes horribly wrong. The game encourages you to use your secondary currency and will try to milk you for every cent. Not to mention that the ""Best Value"" is $100.",1
Fuuuuuuufuuuuuuuu,1
Excellent game play,5
Riley,5
Could see how this good go the way Clash of Clans did for me though...,4
Always crashes every 5 min,1
:-),5
Says swipe the minion and its unresponsive. Cant even play it.,1
Was thinking this would be like any of the old dos  games and was quickly disappointed.   Timers just kill this game.,1
My biggest gripe is you can be constantly be attacked.when you successfully defend your dungeon you will lose resources(gold / stone) and can be attacked again to lose more resources. I had 3 successful defends and lost the 4th defend. I went from 2.1 million gold to 345 thousand gold. Successfully defending will gain a higher rank but higher rank means you can be attacked by stronger people...,3
The wait times really slow down game play.,4
Can't type in my dungeon name also microtransactions,1
Like it so far,4
Very much like the original.,5
It's kool,4
The game will not load all the way it gets to 90% and then crashes starting on 10-12-15,4
Please wait while your imps get your dungeon in order always shows up while I'm in a battle then I lose my streak so 3 stars,3
Best game,5
"Easy playability, improved graphics, and some new sadistic fun, make this remake worth the download. Good for all of you old geeks like me that are looking for that nostalgic game with some updated features.",5
"You are pitted against far more advanced players both in attacking and defending your dungeon. Moderate players are just fodder for the (paying) fanatics. And in this game, you pay for EVERYTHING.",1
Very fun,4
Heard about this online and figured and I figured I give it a shot. Big mistake on my part waiting for minions to be created like in Clash of Clans. This whole thing is a micro transaction pincher to strip you of being able to enjoy even half of the game. Challenges that are more of a joke that are technically min in rushes and trial and error which may take forever to redo. Place takes way to long to mine walls. Enjoying also paying premium currency for imps.,1
"I love the original DK 2, this type of game is not for me.",2
"No bugs yet, very enthralling.",5
Loving  it !!!!!!!!!,5
"You know those pay to play games that give you enough to do and free stuff on day one to keep your attention and get addicted?  Yeah, this isnt one of them...  You start out with a tutorial but if your like me and loved the pc version you just want it to stop.  After the tutorial you have pretty much nothing left to do unless you pay money for more imps.  This is nothing like the pc version and to me was PAINFULLY slow to play.  If you manage to keep playing this, you have too much money or free time.",2
loved it sence the orignal still good,5
Been playing for a long time now and I really get tired of having 30+ win streaks get thrown out the door because of the game stopping and loading at the beginning of a battle.,4
You took a game from my childhood and made it pay to win.,1
Great time killer,5
Can't play the game error 1.7,1
It's a great game! When I can play. I've only successfully connected twice. And both times I was disconnected. I have great signal and I have 4g.,1
Takes a while to build up but it is so worth it!  You don't have to spend a lot of money on this game but it does help to buy some gems to get more minions,5
Long wait times,3
"I absolutely loved the original game, I was so excited to see this then.....I played it. What a shame, it's not like the original, not as fun and you have to pay or wait forever. It's a shame that this is the direction this game took. Why can't games just let you buy them outright anymore?! I'm truly disappointed.",1
The minions no longer have personalities in the dungeon. They missed an opportunity to modernize the genders of some minions with stereotypes as far as the eye can see.  For better or worse the free to play late game is pretty low time commitment once the dungeon is carved the way you want.  Carving dungeons can be tedious as you can't swap trap positions and my s-pen stopped working with the game.  The strategy elements of the game are entertaining.,3
Great game... Faster paced than coc which is great ... Way better than the comp game!,5
Horrible POS. Stay away unless you LOVE waiting days for simple actions to complete or paying $5 each time you want to play the game.,1
Would not work at all,1
Like it but won't let me text dungeon name,4
When I go to name my dungeon it wont let me. My keg board just goes away when I try typing. Please fix as fast as possible. Other wise I would freaking love this game,3
Played it for years,5
Good enough.,5
"Like CoC, though a crap ton more expensive and with an evil twist. Love the voice work! But alas after a few days of gaming I can now see the writing on the wall. The wait times are too long, the resource gathering is too small, and the raiding does not make up for any of it. You are going to have to pay to play, there is no way around it. Oh and did I mention raids take everything in this one, money, resourses, and your troops. You wake up to nothing most mornings.",1
It a great games but when it dont save so when i got a news phone i had to start all the way over,3
Good stuff,5
I have been trying to play but it keeps crashing. I'm still trying to claim my first quarry and it keeps crashing. Please fix!!! I wanna play!,2
It will not let me type in a dungeon name. So I am stuck and can't keep playing.,1
"Don't bother. If you try to edit your dungeon,  the moment your WiFi  blips you'll be under attack for the next 20 minutes apparently.",1
Great game for die hard raiders.  search out the Ivory Palace guild!,4
A new way of a tower defense game that captures the original spirit of the first game.,5
Gems are a bit expensive only real downfall of the game,4
"Fun game, great price - free!",5
Too fun too put down,4
There will probably never be a game like the first 2 I'd gladly buy the 3rd game for my pc and one so long as it's a set price and not a pay to win,4
Amazing game!,5
Almost as fun as the computer game,4
It's fun but like most games now days you have to be patient or spend $,5
"Forces my game into a repeated login server derp. Was working last night, go to refresh slaps and getting this bs.",1
"It really is fun... But and it's a BIG BUTT... I can't play for more than a few moments, before the game needs to reload. At first it was annoying, now it is just plain ruining the game experience! It freezes in mid raid, so I lose my troops, lose my revenge status, etc! I have some patience, so this loading crap wouldn't usually affect me, but when it starts interfering gameplay, AFTER I'VE PAYED REAL MONEY TO PLAY, it makes me mad! I'd rate it lower, but I did pay to play... Just tired of losing shhhhhh to the load screen.",3
Cool,5
rt,3
Every time I start the game it just stops working.,1
I love tutorial! Just kidding... I cannot enter my dungeon name it doesn't work...,1
"I love the dungeon keeper games but sadly, as with most games nowadays, it's strictly online. It sickens me what the gaming industry has come to. What happened to the choice of playing offline or online? Now if you don't have Internet access you can suck it apparently.",2
Its fun.For what little I was able to play. I don't know if its me but for the mobile android device or the device I have it won't allow me to type my dungeon name into the box and submit it. I can hit the submit box but I can't type anything in to submit box.,2
Please put in redo button,1
"It would be better if it didn't reload my dungeon in the middle of a raid. This has happened multiple times. It lets you place your minions and reloads, causing you to not only lose the raid but the minions as well.",3
Hardly a shadow of what this game is supposed to be.,1
Will not connect to server... If and when it does the game forcecloses when gets to creature behind the door. Please fix.. Very frustrating.,1
Just haven a lot of fun with this app it's goofy and great ha ha ha,5
Best so far,5
Great time eater,5
"I really liked the original game back in the day and this is an adaptation. The pvp system is garbage. If you get any ranking you will be continuously attacked by a barrage of players whose abilities will appear godlike, this is the point where you will realize that there are people who actually waste money on this garbage. I'll never carry my tablet around enough to really get into this game and unless you have a giant phone then you're not going to enjoy playing this game on it. Overall I give this game a rating of... Bleh...",1
Great game its easy to play on computer its harder on phone I dont know about tablet so I cant say much,4
I would rate higher if it dident have to reload every 5 min plz fix,1
"Right from the start save your gems. Even the tutorial where it inclines you to use them. Just save them. This game takes time. And you can cut down that time with more imps. Do the quests on the bottom right, and save up the challenges in the battle menu for when they appear as a quest netting you quick gems, and if your patient imps go on sale for 40% off, helping you get the best bang for your hard earned gems. Raid constantly, rise through the ranks and earn gems for doing it.    Cheers",5
Lower prices,5
"Finally, dungeon keeper for android. Thank you for making a great pc game into a portable master piece.  Keep it up!!!    Make number 2 soon, maybe more like the original pc dungeon keeper for all of us hard core dungeon keeper fans.",5
Can't find it...,4
"Fun to play, easy, Great time waster.",5
It's A Demonic Clash Of Clans.I Love It Almost As Much As I Love Chocolate Shakes..And I Love Chocolate Shakes,5
"I was a fan of the original game, but not a fan of the art style. it doesn't feel even remotely close to the original and I've never liked games that take time to do thing's. The original Dungeon Keeper was one of the best games I've ever played this is just lame.",1
Keeps crashing all the time I love this game but hate that I'm raiding or building something and it crashes please fix this,5
It is a great game.,5
Makes the game unplayable at times.,3
Nothings wrong with it all I ask is is just add more stuff,5
This might be a great game if everyday I didn't have problems logging in.,1
I enjoy this game! Too cool...,5
How about the game lets me type my name. I can't even get past naming my dungeon. I tried 10 times. I failed every time.,1
Love this game,5
Good as I remember the original.,5
This game is totally amazing. Thank you EA . you never fail us.   This is what you get when an actual reputable gaming company creates a game on Android.   And for whoever is hating just keep in mind this is a free to play so stop your nagging.,2
I refuse toy spend money so I've reached a point where it's awful play competing with ppl who've spent tona of money. Good time killer.,4
So on the quest to unlock the bile demon stutter sets in a dn game locks up.,3
It won't let me name the dungeon so I can't play it,2
"I really like this, it seems to be just like clash of clans",5
"Don't like how some item missions fail to complete with out some reason. Like the bug zapper, just fails every time no matter how many times I take out the heart. Then going into the game and getting blocked because attack in progress...really. Kind of fun game but days to build and dig, ruin the fun these games used to be. Also it not being cross platform save, very annoying.",3
Horny is great!!,5
Got better after payment restructure,4
It's gr8,5
Well the games designer urges you to spend gems saying they will give them back so spend freely never got one gem back so progress and fun are slowed down to a 0 just like I would rate this game if I could and should be ashamed to take the name dungeon keeper!,1
"This game is buggy but the biggest problem is when you have your own guild (1 member) and you are kicked from it with no feedback as to why.  Between the bugs with the onscreen keyboard when trying to submit bug reports, the accidental use of resources and gems due to the buggy ui and you got a good idea what this game is like.  My biggest gripe is that the game barely resembles the dungeon keeper most grew up with.  I think I will stick to war for the overworld.  Also learn to sync notifications properly.",2
When I try to type a name the game dosent let me I can't even begin the game because of this one star until this is fixed,1
Love it,5
Loved playing way back on puter,5
"This is everything wrong with a pay to win game. They took a great title like dungeon keeper and turned it into a ""free 2 uninstall"" disaster. You will need to spend lots of money to get anywhere in this game. Loads of micro transactions and an example of a developer being anti consumer. Basically running a cash grab and disguising it behind a great lineage like dungeon keeper. Nothing like the original and I recommend you stay far far away.",1
"Ok sure this isn't like the original 1997 version of the game, get over it. I loved the original dungeon keeper and I can accept that this is nothing like it and that it is very similar to clash of clans in terms of basic mechanics, however it does have some unique twists. Almost every base you siege will differ greatly from the last which is very refreshing after playing COC and allows you so much freedom in how you set up your maze-like lair. Load times are atrocious but other than that a solid 4/5.",4
Can't get past trying to name my dungeon. Won't let me type it.,2
A twist as opposed to all the clones out there. It's about time I found a strategy game that was not a clone of clash of clans.,4
Good but must spend money,3
"Was a huge fan of the origional, and this port to the android is perfect! Not pay to win at all!",5
"Fix the horrible matching system. Just another, high levels gang up on low levels kind of game.",1
More tower defense and less dungeon building than expected. Guess they had to figure out a way to earn money worth a free app.,4
Good game,4
"Love this game. Haven't played it in a while, & I love the improvements.",5
"seen one pay to play , seen them all.",1
It has so much potential. I'd rather just pay for the game with no gems and wait times.,1
I like what they did with this game..,5
Must play best game ever lots of fun,5
"I don't usually like PvP gameplay, but I actually enjoy that aspect the most in this game. And it just gets better and better the more you play. I recommend this game, but keep in mind patience is needed until you start leveling up.",5
Must play. Loads of fun and built in breaks for multitaskers.,5
LOVED THE GAME UNTIL CHOSE TO DO THE GOOGLE SAVE. NOW I LOST WHOLE DANG GAME!!! 5 MONTHS OF PLAYING FOR NOTHING!!! SCREW THIS GAME AND DEVELOPERS IF THIS HOW THEY DO YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Just a  clash of clans rip-off. This pathetic excuse of a game is a sad attempt to drain people's wallets using the their love of the game EA shut down in the first place.,1
its awesome,5
"I loved the original but EA found a way to make it horrible by way of making you pay to actually advance in the game at a normal speed. I recommend avoiding this game if you don't like paying to play a ""free"" game.",1
"You can have fun and play for free, or pay for extra resources and dominate",5
Having fun,4
Game resets every time I try and build spike trap for the first time.,1
Even if you didn't have to pay for every little thing it's a poor excuse for dungeon building.,1
The best game I've played since Skyrim.,5
it a interesting  game,4
Interesting,4
This game is awesome except the micro transfers crap. Why make a game free if it costs u hundreds off dollars to play and days to do small tasks. Microsoft does the exact same crap with Xbox live and making u pay 80 bucks a game then adding like 4 to 5 add ons that cost 25 bucks or more to get the full game its BS.,4
Keep pads won't open so I can type in a name,1
It won't sync up with my Google account,4
"Keeps me occupied when bored. Recently had to start completely new dungeon. Randomly disconnect, had to play the tutorial 3 times.",3
"None of the charm, none of the playability.. just another shake down of so-called devs prioritizing money mechanics over game mechanics.  I could have had monsters or levels  to buy (read:real content) and would have gladly but instead you had to tarnish a cult classic with your greedy grubbing slime.  Despicable and disheartening.  Lazy and uninspired, you'd have more fun lighting your money on fire.",1
I would've rated 5 stars if I could shape the rooms myself.,4
"Finally, one of my all time favorite pc games in an updated mobile format with awesome pvp..  This game is a must.",5
"I loved the original computer game, this is fun but there are still a few bugs to work out. Wouldn't let me name my dungeon.",3
The game is well laid out and had been fun so far.  Very smooth and goofy fun,4
The keyboard for naming a dungeon does not allow input. Every time I touch a character on the keyboard the keyboard rolls away. Because the game expects input at that point play goes no further.,2
Poop,1
Diabolically awesome,5
Fun!,4
Terrible,1
It'd be nice if other players couldn't steal your resources. That kind of forced PvP is a complete turn-off for me.,1
It doesn't seem like a bad game. But I can't get past name selection for some reason.          It just selects and deselects and wont actually type.,3
"Raids are fun. The game is ok if you can be patient with the upgrade times, but it becomes a little ridiculous when you have to wait 14 days for a single trap to upgrade! The geme wants you to spend money on gems, which are way too overpriced for what they do.",3
Nothing like the original other than the concept. Very similar to games such as boom beach,3
"It's a cool game, but the system that sets up matches is crap. First off, you are often attacked by people who are leaps and bounds beyond your level because of the trophy system. You earn 50 trophies for winning a battle, but lose 2 for a loss. So you end up just getting more difficult with no real way to drop down. Secondly, if you log in and collect gold and stone, you are attacked, within 12 seconds of logging out, repeatedly until someone finally wins. You don't even have time to log back in to rearm.",2
Love how it looks! Play is good. Still have campaigns!,5
"Its a like the original dk, just multiplayer. Games are a little slow due to summoning time and the  ammount of gold/stone from quarries, forcing you to fight and steal from others. There's rewards you can't obtain from grinding, some ridiculously costly making you feel stuck after obsidian ranks. I would not have been able to afford the imps had I not spent real money on this game. Kind of a drag. Maybe making the units/buildings obtainable without a 4th currency would make things better.",4
"Everything I start the app, it crashes right after the logo screen. Just installed it and tried running, no go. I hope they fix it but it's EA so probably not.",1
Fun,5
Off the hook,5
It's clash of clans all over again,2
"This game is Clash of Clans with a reskin. I love this franchise, and to see it fall so low with it's extreme time gate and oppressive money sinks it just breaks my evil little heart.  If you love Clash of Clans, by all means install this game. If you loved DK1 & 2, steer clear or have your heart broken like me.",1
It won't let me in I used to have it but I deleted it this happened when I first downloaded it now again plz fix,4
Reminds me of the original,4
"Just like all other tower apps. Somewhat original content, with no original play. The wall system even seams flawed. Its a cave wall. Not a castle wall. In my opinion, that means you cant fly or attack over it. Line of sight only.  I will say i love the song and the humor. If they rework it just a little more. easily a 5 star game all day. Maybe 3 starter imps. Larger play area. Flying units that dont pass walls just ground attacks. Maybe tweak the immortals a little more as well. Over all not bad but fail.",1
Have loved ghis game for years....so happy to find it for my tablet....only wish I could play offline as well,5
Originally got game upon release needed a lot of work was very buggy and I truly was on satisfied since then they've made quantum leaps with the changes it is a lot more fun mainly bug free no problems here thank you for making an original classic fun,5
"Own the first 2, yes the win 95 and win2k version.. still has some of the original feel.. with new little twists. Bullfrogs original was still the best one yet,  but its definatly not bad for a touch version.",5
"I've never played a game of this sort, but it's turned out to be quite fun. If you're having second thoughts about downloading the game, dont. I'm sure you'll like it.",4
Nope,2
Addicting malicious strategy! Delicious!,4
This pc classic has been ruined by the most expensive pay to play set up,1
Its great,5
I use to play this all the time back in the day. I loved it and still do!,5
treade it you for boom beach,1
I love the game and all but redesigning the base is a hassle if you had like a edit mode that takes away blocks you've made and all your rooms and traps i would be very happy.,4
Great game bring in salamanders and the spell where you get to see threw the one of your creatures eyes and it becomes 1st person like in dungeon keeper 2 lol that  would be fun!,5
For those who wqnt to be more like The Overlord and less like the hero,4
"Seriously, EA, stop nickel and diming me. Give us a full version of these games with a clear up front cost we can play a real game. And what's with that fake email address with a catch all auto answer? If you don't have a real email don't lie to us.  I played Dungeon Keeper back when Bullfrog Owned it. Why can't I buy games like I used to? Now it's just pay to win...  There are quite a few games like that now. It's sickening. Does EA even make games of their own anymore?",1
Pretty cool game,5
I'll rate again later if I like it,3
I can't even open it!!!!! It force closes instantly every single time,1
It's awesome,5
Can't enter name for dungeon and can't continue,2
Love it,5
I can't type my name in tutarial. Now I can't  even  install  it.,1
"Digging time must be reduced. 4 hrs, really? At least down to one hr, or 30 min. Otherwise, the game is cool",4
Which is a lot,4
"Ok whats going with this game now. Its constantly crashing, lagging or loading. It will stop mid battle...it use to run fine. Too many updates is making this a bloated cow. Its a Good game. The dark cousin of clash of clans but it seems like its messed up now. Gonna give a couple more days then I will uninstall it if it's not improving.",4
Long time fan of this game!,5
Ghana,5
you forgotten the start button.,1
Enormously expensive to move past pay-wall. Otherwise 3 months of digging tiles is your game.,2
Awesome game.,5
"I would like it a lot more if despite my turning notifications off, it would stay off. It loudly announces when buildings or imps are done. It won't turn off!",3
Woo,5
"I used to play Dungeon Keeper 2 with my dad back when it first came out. The reason I downloaded this was for the sake of nostalgia. In-app-purchases drag this game down. It's like EA got their greedy hands on a classic game and then proceeded to try really hard to wring out your wallet. Thankfully, you don't have to purchase anything if you have the patience. This game makes you wish you were playing DK 2 instead. If you like really SLOW strategy games... this is for you.",2
"If you have limitless bank account or time its perfect for you, and the reviews are rigged too!",1
Great humor and very addictive,5
"I may enjoy smacking minions, however I do not enjoy my dungeon as it is. There should be an option to destroy rooms, as well as a dungeon editor.",2
Love it,5
How but you guys figure out a way to keep this game stable instead of getting booted out of costly battles.,2
Every time I try to open the app it leaves the app,1
It's very good for casual players,4
Cool game. But it keeps restarting my progress. If I didn't have to start over every 5 minutes I would five star,2
"Went through a tutorial that basically told me to give EA money. Went to name my dungeon, wouldn't let me. I give up.",1
Not to bad,4
Awesome,5
It's been forever since I've played dungeon keeper.,5
"This game is fantastic for a depressingly short time. One you get your third imp, you're pretty much at endgame unless you pay money or are willing to spend weeks farming achievements. The game wasn't pay to win and wasn't so punishing with wait times, it would easily be my favorite game on mobile.",1
"EA has destroyed a wonderful game.  They have sullied a work of art.  Whomever is responsible for this treasonous filth should have the same worked upon their body, while they are kept alive for as long as possible.",1
Runs great...no prob....at least yet...lol well done....i wish they made this again on pc......,4
"All it wants is money. 5 minutes of game, feed us cash, 5 minutes of game, more cash. Complete rip-off.",1
"It seems the creators of this title never played the original Dungeon Keeper, they just heard about it. Actions that should take mere seconds to complete now take hours.... unless you want to pay with real money. Shame on you EA! Making a single room should not take 2 whole days but 20 seconds.   ... I deleted the digital abortion after a few minutes.",1
Its great,5
Frequently drops connection with the server when doing raids and you lose everything you'd used so far.,2
Great game love it so far,4
I got a free song though?????,1
I was liking this game. Time needed was okay. Now new version waited 2 days for upgrade to unlock new things. Theynever unlocked. Now it takes attack points to upgrade dungeon heart. People attack more often never enough resources to update anything. This is why I quit clash of clans....any fun left in this game gone. Too many people attacking from three tiers up I'm gold 1 obsidian one attacking. Still never get enough to upgrade and now need to compete in the tournaments to get the new in game currency. Updated  I am DONE. TOO MANY ATTACKS.,1
Came back after 6 months worse than before can't defend your self still but worse. No balance in attack and defense.,1
Always a good game,5
To da Bones!,5
Whould give 5 if wasenr so lagy,4
"Entertaining and addictive. I played the original and I  like this version also. Some missing info at times but very playable. Lots of notifications though. Thanks for creating a game that'll  suck up my already limited time, enjoy.",4
"You hit the pay-wall pretty quick, but other than that it's really fun and a great time waster.",5
Whenever you attack another dungeon it goes black off in the middle its an constant irritation  and so it sucks,3
Good,5
"Great fun, and a nice relief from clash of clans",5
Unplayable. Crashed more times than I can count in the tutorial alone. Not worth the download - sucks too - I was looking forward to revisiting the franchise,1
Love this game then and now,5
"I enjoy passing some time setting up the dungeon. Can take awhile building out, but still fun.",5
Fun tower defense with cool twist,5
IM OP NO ONE CAN BEAT ME SO EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Love dk,5
This game was so bad it gave me cancer. Avoid it at all cost.,1
this is just like the pc version but even more enjoyable and even an online version with guilds the best gamplay of its style of dungeon TOWER DEFENSE game play!!!........,5
Pay to win bullshit,1
Love the app..,5
Imps getting dungeon together happens way too much.,2
Its a little different then most games of its kind and that's why I love it!!!,5
"The graphics are great - just like the old PC game. The gameplay is pretty good  suffering mostly from very limited placement of your corridors and traps.  You will notice when raiding that most of the stronger dungeons all look the same - a mandala like maze of passages with a minimal number of rooms. This is nothing like the creativity of the original.   There are two serious problems. The first is that it is very intrusive - sending updates even when shut down among other things. Yes this can be tweaked but I couldn't easily find the settings to do so - so no stars lost for this, just a mild frustration.  The second point is that despite changes, the pay wall is still very steep and very high. Sure the game is free but to get the same experience as the original would cost far far more in micro payments.  This would be much less of a problem if the micropayment model had concentrated on providing payment only extras rather than crippling basic game play.  Play until just before you get frustrated then uninstall.",3
Cool,5
I loved the original and this is similar to multilayer og. I like how it's not too expensive and you can play for free without losing to others all the time,5
Crashes after 1 min every time. Error code 7. FIX IT.,1
Very well thought out app,5
Love,5
Its fun but its basically a cash grab.  It still takes months to level up.  Progression is still measured in years.  It's still a cashgrab.  You can only play for a few minutes daily basically.,3
"Long time fan, love the app",5
"Sure it's fun for 5 minutes, then it's pay to unlock this, pay for that, blah blah. Screw this, it's a sham trying to capitalize on good PC games. I'll stick to running the PC games on my phone through an emulator.",1
"I want to restart the game to make my dungeon better and more manageable,  BUT I Can't.  I don't want to make any other account just to reset this game.  The imps also cost so many gems while getting those many would take years to do.",1
Needs a bit more work,4
Classic,5
I Loved this game  when I used to play it on Win95.  This updated version is even better!,5
Omg you should get it it is awesome,5
I didn't play it yet,5
Cool,5
Fairly fun game but like most EA products the game is hard driven more so than most on you to purchase in app items to really progress. I understand that their sole purpose is to attain more money but EA is above and beyond greedy. Still it is decent even if you don't succumb to buying gems.,3
Should be more like the original game. Constant online content is stupid. Can someone make games with the gamer in mind not the money.,2
Hilarious and very fun,5
Some things are different but the feeling is the same as the original. I've wanted to play it again for some time now and now its back! I'm thrilled!,5
Raids are unbalanced continually get matched with dungeons 10 to 20 levels higher than me and impossible to win with such a level gap plus purchased dungeon protection dose not work still get raided,1
Every time I minimize the game progress restarts,1
Just as much fun as the original,4
Fun.,5
Fun,4
Awesome once u play u won't want to stop and if u think ur good enuf I'll be waiting so bring the game and get ready for some shame lately having trouble with the beginning loading process,3
Very good and funny but long loading,5
I've loved the mechanics of this game immensely and cannot express how happy I am that its actually pretty generous without buying extra stuff. Raiding and defending is actually pretty amazing and everything feels rewarding.,5
Guys this is unacceptable I'm playing on a brand new tablet with my router less than ten feet away and I keep getting booted in battle to my home dungeon. Not good if people are spending money and getting booted.,2
A good little game that is reminiscent of the pc version. Good to see it on mobile... kudos to the developers.,5
"It's a money Grubbing piece of crap that shouldn't be existing it's another one of ea's ""games"" If you could call it that, that everyone needs to stop buying into doggeroll like this if your coming into the gaming industry this is the most #1 thing to STAY AWAY FROM if I could I would give it a negative rating",1
Love this game and always have i was so happy someone made a moble one 5 star all the way thanks.,5
"Very unique base game compared to the major contenders,  super fun and diverse!",5
Fun to play,4
"Pointless to build walls. People buy expensive heroes dragons with real money that just fly over. When did anyone build a dungeon without a roof? Seriously, call the game maze keeper.",1
"In the latest version now, my app downloads patches every time I start it.  Does anyone know why that may be happening?  I don't want to pay it if it is going to kill all my data.",3
Hes right its not the same it has a little bit more loading and more pixels and better graphics,2
Game,5
Look up dungeon keeper 2. Nothing like the actually game,1
Easy to learn and enjoyable.,5
Love it! Reminds me of old times..,5
"This game is fun. Loved the original. (well done per phone version!) 1. Add more info* to certain items like bolstering. #2. THE WAIT TIME for the blocks is wayyy too long., however games fun. Need to make an easier way to see when tourneys are lasting or when they start-finish. Ive paid alot of money to this game,  gems are WAY too hard to get.... MAKE PART 2. thanks. Xoxo",4
Nice game,5
:-),5
This is right up my strategy alley,5
I'm winning big defensive points against high ranking ppl sending 1 unit. This has to be dropped connections. I have lost a number of attacks due to this myself.  Glitch wins are cheap.,3
Great,4
Game is sick. They actually gi e u enuff free gems to let you play for free.,5
If your looking for a time sink please look no further. That and there's something truly satisfying about slapping imps.,4
"Not a bad game, but it can get pretty tedious without enough imps. Rocking out in battles to raise your league status is about the only way to get gems less you buy them. But, for a free app, it's really good.",4
Fun,5
Can only one the game once.  My phone needs to be restarted for the game to open again,1
Power level of the minions seems to be a lot less now than what it was before the update. I can't give it any more stars than that...now the zoom doesn't work...can't take away the last star....,1
Still needs work but getting there,3
Crashes as soon as I open it.,1
Its basicly dk version of clash but with some interesting difference.,4
It reminds me how awesome the original games were...,3
Only thing slowing down the game is build times,5
Great game,5
*****---*-----********-------*******--*-*-*-******----*---------******----**-***-*--******---******--**-*-** (it is a secret code with took me a long time to make,5
So far so good I have only been playing a day but at least you can earn gems faster than most games,3
Nice,5
Love it,5
"24 hours to clear a gem vein? Extreme money loving thugs out there. If you interrogate me why its one star or ask me why, then I will laugh at everybody. Forget this game and play the pc version. You are better off without this crook of a ""game."" Enjoy this review ;)",1
Suprised @how addicting it is,4
I've been hoping I would see this! Thank u!,5
Lacks alot from PC version but still fun to play,4
Loved the game back in the day like this one. Toss a few bucks at it and it goes faster or don't. Still fun to play. Fun to find the best layout to ensure survival from others. I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes strategy and evil...,5
Getting really tired of this game downloading the updates every time I want to play it takes forever and it takes up a extra 51mb of space,2
Maybe even more fun than the original PC version.,5
"A classic , bring back the good times :)",5
"Good game, but I just bought swampus for full price, then about half an hour later he went on sale for only 500 gems.Is there any way to get some gems back?",3
"Fun game , but slow pregression",4
"Its really fun, i just keep raiding. It can entertain me for hours.",5
Not the old game by far but fun still,3
I keeps crashing on my Note 3,4
Because of rule changes and rebalanced items certain challenges are no longer able to be completed. I know cause I am In the middle of rebuilding my dungeon and I know the bug zapper challenge was never as hard as it is now.,3
The original dungeon keeper took like to seconds this takes 15 days,1
One of the better ones.,4
I played this year's ago on the PC. Nice piece of nostalgia.,5
"4/7/15: Made a complaint about in game keyboard not working two months ago. No answer. For over a year now the Troll bug is not fixed even tho they said it was. Freezes when raiding another dungeon = equals automatic loss, which happens at least once a day. This game used to have excellent customer service but that is now also gone. Almost not worth playing any longer. update 7/31/15  In game keyboard still does not work. Made multiple complaints but NOTHING has been done. 6 months now. No answer from EA.",1
So far so good,4
It keeps crashing right after i rename my place,4
Easy & Fun to Play & Learn A must download,5
"As the title says, the concept is great. The gameplay blows. Often I find myself having to reclick something 3 - 4 times to get it right. GUI is too small now. The biggest issue I have is how stinkin long it takes to do anything. I am at the point where it takes 1-4 DAYS to complete any action. I would have to pay to speed it up. Well, I paid 8$, about what I would be willing to pay for a game of this caliber, but I won't pay more. And now my interest is dwindling as I am forced to wait longer and longer.",2
Can't make a name,1
This is a very good game but today a box appeared on my guard post with an imp face on it please tell me what it is please it is very weird.,5
Good fun. Glitches. Wish for more monster choices are weapons. Not bad,3
No where near as good as clash of clans,3
I can't get past the name your dungeon,3
Great now that it has been fixed and enhanced,5
Not quite like the old PC game but enough quirky fun,5
"The game crashes on startup. I haven't even been able to get to the title screen. I would love to actually be able to play this game, but as it is, it's just taking up space in my sim card.",1
Very fun like the computer game,5
"This is the same as all the other games.  Build a base, go attack other people, get suckered out of your money.  Anyone who played the original dungeon keeper game for the PC will be very disappointed in this game.",1
I love this game. Way better then clash of clans,5
One of the best games I have played in a long time.,5
Its ok,3
Fun,5
"Not perfect and can be slow, but I am enjoying it.",4
It won't even open because it's optimized for tablets so don't make it a phone game if it doesn't seem to work,1
Super super super awsome,5
It waz fun and easy to play,5
"Issue with game data being out of sync and causing it to reload over and over. Only fix is to delete game data, and it happens again a few days later. They had an offer of a free Imp with any gem purchace, so I purchased enough gems to unlock an Imp and expecting that I could then redeem the free Imp and get two Imps... Well, it didnt work that way. They automatically give you the Imp and I then didn't have the gems to purchase the next one. Everything else is redeemed why not the free Imp?",4
Fun game,5
Fun game but slow progress and annoying mandatory pvp.,4
When I want to play and I tap on it was it does not work plz fix it,2
It not bad however my phone can't type message or write a dungeon name but all in all it fun little time waster,4
I still plat my dungeon keeper games.  Its nice to see it in a stratagy pvp game like this.,5
A over-time game,5
Nothing like the original. Terrible. Pay to win game.,1
"Awesome game from back in the day but won't play on my android. Downloaded twice and either freezes at the ""connecting"" stage or just shuts down. Would rave and rate if I could play.",1
Yeah,4
It seems fun right now,5
This game is so fun,5
"I've found it gets one sided once you reach a certain point, if you're lucky. Every so often I've had to restart my phone just to be able to raid other dungeons. Not your best work EA.",3
Badass to play,5
Nothing beats being able to slap a few imps around this game is quite addictive and the red dude that pops up can be very humorist,4
"Dont like the long waits, but addictive game.",5
But this app is a recreation of the favorite of an eclectic few.,5
"The game is fun and I enjoy the DK theme, however the ""buy my stuff"" messages are very annoying.  The micro transactions gets -1 star.",4
Amazing,5
Fun game,5
"I would love to give game a proper rating but I can't even log in to play it. Every time I try it say "" error connecting to server code 7 ""   PLEASE HELP",1
Great game!  Keep up the evil work!  3:),5
"I remember I still have the actual game they made long ago and it was amazing, hate to see they made it into this where everything it timed and such costs money and everything nothing like the old game",3
I bought gems and the game glitches while processing. 2 days later I realized it had gone through but I never got my gems. The devs asked me for proof (which I provided in spades) and I never heard from them again. WATCH OUT THIS GAME LITERALLY STEALS YOUR $$$.,1
"All of the sudden I can barely connect to the game, and getting disconnected during battle happens waaaay too often. This happens both on mobile data and WiFi.",3
Good,5
"Dungeon keeper mobile is an example of taking a unique game franchise and turning it into everything else that's trending. And when that happens, you get something mediocre. Don't waste your time or money on it",2
"Love this game. Its a bit of Overlord and the Arcade Classic Gauntlet with some good humor, nice graphics, and lots of upgrades. Loads of fun.",5
Good one...,4
Awesomenesssss,5
Im chums with the dungeon keeper,5
Best game I've ever played,5
"Untill the latest sale on immortal, now everybody flies past all traps with just a single immortal taking it all for free, now its the worst game ever",1
This game is so fun. Its an oldschool version of clash of clans.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ,5
"This game is like every other builder game, you can invade other dungeons which is interesting. Although it is not balanced for level. Unfortunately like most other builder games you need to spend a fortune in money, or wait forever to do anything.",3
This is so dumb play the originals way better then the microtransactions in this pile of crap.,1
I'm going to be a great problem to other players,5
Dungeon keeper ripe off with lile most mobile games now a clash of clans style game if you liked the classic Dungeon Keepers safe your self some crush hopes and dreams and leave this alone im uninstalling this after i post this. Thanks EA for ruining a classic yet again...,2
Fun game. But it updates WAY too often and for no reason. Also disconnects a lot.  Way more than other games on the play store.,2
"As a huge fan of the classic PC titles, I am impressed with the translation over to the ""freemium"" style genre.  Though lacking in the sandbox ability I enjoyed in the original,  it makes up for it with a nice bite-size gaming style that is just as easy to pick up and put down as it is to get sucked into for hours on end.",4
It's cool,5
To slow.,2
Woop,5
I love to slap my imps!! This  games is part tower defense which I love! Thank you very much! !,5
Decent game so far.. better than a better portion of dungeon  building games available on android market,4
Slow loading. Hard to keep enough cash to keep traps enabled. You will be defeated after enough attacks disable your traps. Can you PLEASE let us bypass the  introduction and ask us for an existing account. Its a pain to walk through starting a dungeon you'll never use if we have to clear cache or reinstall.,3
"It's been a year since I've played, and I was pretty excited that my dungeon and progress were saved, but now whenever I try to open, I get a patching error code. Please fix!",2
Tired of being attacked every 5 to 10 minutes can't save any gold or stone when being attacked that much,1
Amazing game. Used to have it for my pc. Ahh nostalgia. Love it.,5
Google keyboard doesn't work . my phone is a ZTE please fix,4
Awesome,5
I only have 4 games where I log into everyday..and this is one of them,4
Good,4
...would be five stars if not for build/dig times,3
I've filled the game from it's first one.,5
Reminds me of the originals,5
Awesome,5
Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome,5
Some of the upgrades take way too long,3
"I feel sad for anyone that gave this game a 5 star review. I feel sad because they obviously don't know what the original Dungeon Keeper was, and if they do, than they don't deserve to be called fans. The game does what every almost every free to play app does - they slow down gameplay so much, that you're willing to pay ludicrous amounts of real money to get it back to where it was. The only reason this game exists is to put you in a psychological battle between your patience and your wallet.",1
VERY VERY VERY ADDICTING,5
Good stuff.,5
"Love this game.. I've been at it for a while... would be five stars but since the last update the game won't recognize the stylus for my note 4... it's alot easier to build with it,  especially with the small wall blocks... so fix that n u'll get ur 5.   ;)",4
"I had this app in my iPhone before, now I'm rocking an android and it's a lot faster and even more fun now",5
Fun and cute. I really like this game,5
The best game of all time I can't stop playing it,5
would be nice if timers were not measured in days. really?,4
Ok,5
Amazing,5
"Loved the pc version, so far this matches up perfectly",5
Love it,5
"I've been a long time fan of the Dungeon Keeper games, and this is no disappointment! :)",5
Lots of variety.,5
Awesome. love the game.,5

"You have to think about your defense and offense.  You can't just plow through, and if you set it up right you can't get plowed over either.",5
I enjoy smacking my minions around.,5
I gave it 5 cuz of the concept but it need a better in the game way to get gems,5
Yes finally not sure what was done but it's fixed n back to normal so glad... truly is a great game... I loved it so much I ordered it online for my pc... thanks again,5
I have a lot of fun but it takes a time for things to update. I have been playing for a year and still not fully upgraded,5
"Load times, constant required Internet access, and the gem system keep it from having a perfect score.",3
The load times cause me to want to play less.,4
Great game. Kinda  like CoC but different kinda too. Love it u should get it!,5
This game is a Keeper.,5
"What an insult to such a classic game, don't even think about giving EA your money for this, they don't deserve it for pumping out this trash.",1
Fun,4
This was a great bullfrog game looks way cooler than before! Update: This game is the best tower-lair defense game out there. Have been playing from day one on android. Forget the rest get the best! UPDATE: Whenever something goes wrong the Devs are right on it!,5
It tells me to type my name but I can't for some reason. please fix it I want to keep playing,3
Pretty fun,5
Is anyone surprised at this point?,1
Get the game,4
"I was a fan of the original almost twenty years ago, love it",5
Cool,5
Don't bother wasting your time setting up traps and making your dungeon a complex maze because everyone is just going to literally fly over all of it.,3
"Was fun for a while, but now I lose so much gold and stone in raids I haven't been able to train or build in a long time.  Pointless once things cost in the millions, unless you plan on playing and raiding several times a day.",2
"a rip off of the original, buy the computer game, it is a million times better!",1
Great,5
Same,3
I love this game,5
Great for those of us who are a fan of the old school DK games.,5
"Well, raiding a dungeon  seems a little easier  than defending your dungeon because the traps don't  seem to be strong enough even with optimal placement but the game is still  fun.",4
Good way to pass the time and very fun to boot,5
Awesome,5
I've only just started playing but it has potential. If your into strategy games I recommend at least give it a go.,4
"Ultra addictive, once you start you just can't put the game down, almost as good as the original",5
Nice,4
Almost as good as the one a decade ago,4
Fun game. Unique strategy style. Don't have to worry about coming on and being devastated that all your hard work is gone. A little expensive in time. The game gives the gems freely and that is refreshing.,5
Crashes a lot can't pass tutorial does not save progress when It crashes. On a game with timer its pointless to play.,1
I remember playing the original Dungeon Keeper. This game is every bit as fun as the original.,5
Been playing DK mobile for about a year now and game play and engagement has improved 100-fold.,4
Pay and slow build times are sometimes frustrating but the pvp and defense raids are fun. Works fine on galaxy s5.,4
I love to raid guys but a crash in the middle of a raid sucks. Especially when it's up to 100%. I just got effed in the bee.,4
Reminds me when I played the original DK and DK 2 on pc awesome,5
It would be alright if they didn't crash so much and they actually give you a star for 50%,3
Really enjoy the game. Only complaint is drop price on imps.,5
Looks like original DK even the voice is the same  but it's focus  is on building dungeon and defending against other players,5
"Someone help me, I can't seem to name my dungeon, when I type it doesn't type anything",3
Can log in on my tablet it lodes then gos black and then out of the app,5
"I thought this game was forgotten about, still love the original but this app is a great revival.",5
Good,4
Addictive fun!,5
Horny is the devil,4
Favorite game fromy yourh!,5
Good game,5
Takes me back to the old DK with a slight twist for today's mobile gaming.  Don't listen to the haters!,5
"I was having a ton of fun with this game, very enjoyable, not too monotonous, not too pricey, but I've now sunk 40 bucks into this game, and every time I try to build, or increase my imp build speed 2x, or basically click on anything the game goes into a cycle of trying to reconnect to the server, then flashing my dungeon for a split second, then it trys to reconnect again. Over and over. Fix it and I'll re rate 5 stars. I'm not happy what so ever, do not dl this game till this problem is fixed. Xperia ‚Ñ¢ Z2",5
Completely built off of micro - transactions.,2
I like it but put more people in it,5
Brings back awesome memories,5
Can't change dungeon name or report bugs. The keyboard disappears every time I try.,1
Didn't work.,1
I played this game on pc a VERY long time ago. I missed smacking my imps.,5
"SUPER fun take on the tower defense concept! However, this game DRAINS my battery REALLY bad, even with my phone plugged in! With my phone plugged in it drains my batter by about 1% per minute! I can only play 40 minutes or so at a time or else risk phone death. I REALLY want to play this, but can't. It drains my GS4 faster than my screen does, according to battery monitor, and it makes my battery dangerously HOT!",2
Great game that keeps you on your toes.,5
I think the game has potential.,4
YAH,5
"The only reason it's called dungeon keeper is to pull in nostalgia dollars. This is nothing like the real dungeon keeper, and the pay wall is too huge for this to be considered a real game.",1
Way too fast!,1
This is a fun game. I would recommend this to anyone who has played the original computer game.,4
Can be played for free but it takes a whole lot longer to get the upgrades that way. Still fun though.,4
Upgrades to your dungeon take a long time as you advance. Imps cost way to much. All and all though this is a fun time killer as long as you don't expect immediate results.,3
This game is pretty awesome. Horny's voice sounds really cool.,5
"The beginning had a little too many instruction boxes. Maybe could've found a different way to explain how to do things. Even after you finish the eternal tutorial, there isn't much to do. Even if there were, you can't really do it. The game very poorly instructs you on how do do, well, anything. However, once you DO figure eveything out, the game isn't that bad. Sure, there's a lot of waiting for things to be built or upgraded, but, other than that, it's pretty okay.",3
"Looks like this game is right up my alley, but I can't enter dungeon name. Keyboard disappears every time I touch it. Droid turbo",1
Not the same Dk in used to.,3
Why do the updates sit in cache? Every time I clean my cache on my phone I need to re-update the game to play. Did an idiot write the software?... or something else? Kinda stupid in my opinion. I'm uninstalling it because I can't play it.,2
Its not the PC game but its still ten times better then the Sims 4.,4
"Anyone who loved dungeon keeper on PC will be sorely disappointed with this cash grab knock off.  The only similarities are the name and some of the graphics, everything else is closer to a clash of clans clone.   Very very disappointing.",2
"Worked great for months, now it crashes every time.",1
"Almost. Boom Beach doesn't have server errors or longish loading time, but this IS a great alternative üëç EDIT: Constant server crashes",1
"Sucks, it won't even let me enter my name and I can't get passed that!!!!",1
Get this game now,1
Can't get past tutorial on Moto X because I can't name my dungeon. Keyboard just goes away when I try to type one.,1
Fun,4
Haven't been able to play in weeks. Wish I could log on and play the game I spent so much money on.,1
Cool fun great,5
Loved it,5
fun time killer,5
Makes other mobile games seem good,1
Amazing game based off the computer game awhile back ago.,5
"I'm very picky with my games, and this is exactly what I was looking for.",5
Crashes during battles making you lose. At the point in the game now where everything takes 4 to 7 DAYS to upgrade or BUY gems to shorten times. Ridiculous. Go buy a proper game for 3 bucks. *** now after beginning of June update won't even open...,1
It's cool,5
I like the game,5
Awesome graphics. Entertaining!,5
"Build times are way too long, especially on map clearing stuff, which is usually a few seconds work on village building games.  And what moron thought air units made sense?  It's a dungeon, it has ceilings you dimwits.  Air units would have to follow the same tunnels as everything else.  If that's not enough, updates are not done via marketplace, which mean no background downloads.  Have to open game and wait, wait more, and wait some more.  Goodbye",1
Finished the tutorial and was asked to input a name but tapping a key minimized my keyboard. Unable to advance.,1
Absolutely atrocious. Packed to the max with wait times and microtranactions. I had to wait an ENTIRE DAY TO DIG OUT ONE BLOCK. GO ONLINE AND BUY THE ORIGINAL GAME.,1
"If you like the old pc game of this name. Then you'll probably like this. Its so very similar, but its not the same",4
"Enjoyed keeper yrs ago, i think i still do",5
No just no micro transactions to sh#$%,1
"I just updated the game, now it won't open. Please fix this quickly, Grrr update please HTC M8 One. THIS GAME IS BROKEN",1
Only wish there wasnt any disconnect. Fun n hard game.,5
Enjoy playing this game its fun,5
"Really Fun game if the glitches would get fixed. Some have been fixed but new ones have appeared. Now I get disconnected a lot when rearranging my dungeon and attacked, easy to lose when your traps and rooms are in the wrong places. Also, I can't use my immortal for 20 hours! Get this fixed!! Shouldn't get punished for arranging your own dungeon!!!!",3
"With the game installed, my battery that normaly lasted 24 hours was sucked up in under 2. Also, the game doesint look appealing, sound appealing, and destroyed a good series.  EA IF YOU READ THIS, MAK A GOOD GAME,",1
I played the original and contrary to some people I think its a good mobile adaptation.,4
Still want u to spend money,3
This game sucked. I couldn't type my name in to the freaking thing. 0 stars.,1
He was right best game ever,5
"Looks like it would be fun, but I can't get past the name your dungeon prompt. Everything I touch the keyboard, it goes away. Lame!",2
Love new update,5
"I quite like this game. Great for casual gamer who is patient.  Recently stopped working completely, closes upon start up. Please fix.",3
I was never able to play the old version. I got the disc. Just can't play it. The only problem I've gotten so far from this version is... Well I can't continue.. I can't name my dungeon.,3
I remeber this game as a kid I played it for hours ive been wanting a remake to be made and this is above and beyond what I thought,5
Cool game,5
Dungeonkeeper,5
Do not open all of your mines! :-),4
This is grade A BULLSHIT nerdcubed was right and I hate it that when it asks you to rate it if you don't give it 5 stars it asks you to explain why its so bad and the reason is it costs 49.99 to dig out one block,1
I liked it,5
It's fun to slap the imps and the graphics are good but getting gems is too slow,5
"Those that have given this turd 5 stars have never played the real Dungeon Keeper game where you designed diabolical dungeons to keep  powerful HEROS from stealing your loot.  The spirit of the game was, ""It was good to be bad""..... Where are the heros? Now its just a Clash of Clans build castle attack other peoples castles but to do so you MUST spend money to be competitive.  Stick with your Clash of Clans account there is NOTHING new or original here.",1
Does not work on my phone after last update,3
Great Game!,5
Awesome just like the original,5
"I remember this game from 10 years ago. Not exactly the same, but It's funny & enjoyable.",4
Error the imps are working on the server i think it will be a good game if they are able to work out the bugs,3
Played the original and am liking this app,5
"Very fun, although I should be able to change my name once for free at least, because the keyboard wouldn't work when I was asked to make a name, and I could only use the top 10 letters on the keyboard (so, my name remains ""typer"" not even capitalized! Also, when I was asked to sign into my google account (for 10 free gems), I could no longer play as my other account, ""tytyyyyyu"", and I had to start over all together! There was no option to get my old account back! Please fix so others don't experience this",3
Just like the original from back in the day. I love it!!!,5
Give us better and upgraded troops for challenges or let us use our own!,3
I have always loved the original Dungeon Keepers. I am so glad they brought this to Android because I was very disappointed when Dungeon Keeper 3 got canned and was never released. Me and my friend were waiting for that game forever.,5
"Not as good as the old PC game, but entertaining none the less",4
Was one of my favorites but haven't been able to play in over a week.,3
So much fun.  Easy game play and instructions,5
It would be four stars otherwise. The pay to play is a little to heavy in the game but it isn't really necessary. It crashes on opening since the last update. Edit: it is a week later and it is still broken.,1
crashes,1
It is the best,5
"it first came in 2000 by bullfog, but EA.",5
This Game Rocks,5
It's still fun. I just wish we didn't have to buy imps with real $$ to gain more. Otherwise good game,5
Great game,5
Indeed it did not let me name my Dungeon so therefore I uninstalled it,1
Good,5
Was fun until the pay wall hit very early. Deleted.,1
"Having played the original pc games, this reconstruction offers all the timeless joy of destroying enemy keepers. Face it, everyone's good at being bad. Keep up the evil. :)",5
Why?,1
It is great to slap your trolls,5
"Can't put in name to complete tutorial, keyboard disappears.",1
I played the original version decades ago on the computer. Is great to go back to those glory days!,5
Not a bad game,4
Great game and update!  Had an issue with infinite loop during that has since been fixed.,5
"After playing through the tutorial, I got to the point where you are supposed to name your dungeon. Every time I tried to use the keypad it would vanish. As a result I  could not name my dungeon or progress forward.     After playing the keypad I finally got two letters to stick. The game is fun but there are too many advertisements, and it tries to get you to buy gems too often.",3
Best dungen keeper  game so fur,5
I like this game but they realy could of though  of a better name than horny  becaus really it's self explanatory,5
On the tutorial and can't enter a dungeon name. I'm on a droid turbo.,4
This game is truely Reaper sent. I can now bring this with me every where I go. I'm am a happy keeper now. If this continues to make me happy I would gladly call this dungeon keeper 3. I am willing to go that far to show how much I love dungeon keeper.,5
Great game,5
I got this game when it first came out.   Hit the pay wall right away.  Gave it a second try recently.   It got alot better.,5
Once again your download just isn‚Äôt happening.  Do you think you could get this worked out.,1
I remember playing this game as a kid on pc glad I can play it on my phone...... I just downloaded the new update and now I can't even play it,1
Dungeon naming issue has been fixed. Now if I was able to move my account from iOS to android device I could give this game the rating it deserves.,3
Fun,5
Ever since new update about 50% of the time i click on my guard post to check immortal status it crashes...,3
"Awsome destructive, strategic",5
I love the way the game play is layed out and how you can defend your base,5
"I love the game but it's really hard to build when you have to wait for a day or more just to find out that when you come back and everything has been takin away, ya it's an automatic rebuild, but I'm taking about the building process, you can pay for the build (paying $5 for 500 gems but a 4h build is 47 gems and increses with the time) but it takes a bit to bring back the resources and then have it destroyed again the next second, otherwise, pretty good game.    Just keep working on it and I'll keep playi",4
Love this game.  Play always.  Look forward to the weekends for tournament.  Players are ausume.  Enjoy jumping from guild to guild.,4
But could u make it where if u make a troop it would defend its spot if u are not there when they attack,5
"Got better, then after last update have issues with loosing connection when trying to raid.  Frequently imps are getting dungeon in order. Not playable.",3
I like the game play...when I go to type the name of my dungeon it closes the key board when I try to type,3
I've loved this game before it was an app,5
"Puzzle Game Strategy  game.It's  a money prompting game, I don't  like that. But it is fun to build. I wish it had categories for tournament  play. It seems people who pay have a huge advantage,  But I play it as free, ground up. I think paying is cheating. I would have just bought it , and it would have been a great game. Now it's just fun to design. It's fun to raid as well, No real way to be competitive  against those who spend the almighty $$. Not for those who want to play the real DK. Still fun,",4
I love slaping impsüòÑ,4
Need more flying defends dragons attack is so op,3
Title said it all.,5
Just lost support for s-pen on Galaxy Note 4. So disappointed.                   Join our clan! e-monkeys,3
"I've been hooked for a while.   Tons to gripe about,  but devs try and it shows.",5
Slow loading.. constant re-update. If that isn't enough the game itself is a mimic of other strat game..i.e. clash of clans?,1
Awesome game almost like building your own town but with imps and a bunch of other cool stuff you can do,4
"You don't get the imps right away, and you can't queue.  Makes the game drag",3
"I love this game. I'm with Skar Tactics, and we have the coolest community! But EA, you guys are great at screwing this game up and not giving a F about your players.",5
But it isnt a game to constantly play. It's played over obscenely long time periods.,4
"Good time waister and you don't ""have"" to spend money to enjoy it. However, some extras are only available with cash.",5
"The game wss fun enough, but a few times in a row of opening the game and it opening my browser asking me to buy things killed it for me",1
"I loved the old compy games! This game is great, still has that evilness thanks guys!!!",5
Its a EA game. Enough said. I think youtubers have covered enough so I don't need to explain why this is terrible,1
Love it,5
"Spent a few days playing, and here's my opinion: the game is definitely designed as pay to win. I don't mind the long build timers, but what turned me off is that you can literally buy extra damage and health boosts for real money. Without gems, you're at a massive disadvantage, even with the same level troops and defenses.  Also, this matchmaking is TERRIBLE!  At 600 trophies (lowest trophy league), I'm getting attacked by players with 2600+ trophies (2nd highest league)! Concept is fun, execution is bad!",2
"I havn't played the original Dungeon keeper, but after seeing gameplay of it and seeing and playing this one, I can safely say: EA f**ked up. Aparently, it takes 24 hours to mine ONE block of dirt with gems in it when it took about 5 seconds or less in the original? What the f**k? Not to mention the gem price's are extremly high(at least quest for stuff's special currency price's are ""cheaper"" but at least this game is functional...and funny at times). Seeing EA make this and Seeing EA make/making   the new Star Wars BattleFront, I can safely say they'll f**k that up to.",1
This game is a farce rip off of the original game just to get your hard earned money do not spend any money in this game unless you like to throw your money away please bring back the original Dungeon Keeper quit trying to screw us,1
Internet required!  Some more of us don't want to waste data to play single player games.,1
Junk,1
"One of the better freemium games I've played. Build times aren't nearly as bad as most people claim, and gameplag is very engaging.",5
"It's like a hilarious mix between clash of clans and old-school dungeon keeper. Download it. Used to be 5 stars, but bugs such as OFTEN disconnects and info screens for traps and rooms appearing with the right part off the screen takes it down a couple pegs. Seriously guys, half my guild has quit this game because of disconnects. Can barely attack or even watch a replay. It's pitiful when compared to every single other game of a similar type. Fix it. I hate rating this so low, but the bugs are unbearable.",1
Awesome game,5
Love this game,5
This is your typical pay-to-wait game. By that I mean you are forced to wait for timers to complete actions or pay real money to reduce that wait. This is a cash grab game and is not worth playing as there are better cash grab games such as clash of clans that are still bad but not nearly as bad as this abomination.,1
Lots of fun great game alot like clash of clans but with a new spin,5
Had to get the Google keyboard to enter my dungeon name. Asus keyboard wouldn't work.,4
"Its pretty great, especially the puzzle of putting it together",5
"I was surprised at how hooked I was at playing this game. Just started a couple days ago, and progressing nicely. Very well thought out game.",5
The game itself is very addicting. The reason I give it 4 stars is mainly because in order to keep playing and have things built faster you need to pay with gems or else you are stuck having to wait hours for something to be built. There is also a waiting time for summoning creatures and if you want that done quickly you need to also pay with gems. The only way to get gems is to pay with real money and you will use up your gems quickly since it costs a lot of gems to speed production.,4
I made it to the point where you name yourself and it wouldn't allow me to so 5 star when its fixed,1
"Was fun, for first couple days. Now. ? Definatly meh.",2
I love how itis lick the dk 1 on pc,5
"Seems like a good remake of dungeon keeper. It does adopt the model of gems for speeding up, available for purchase, but quests and other tasks give you a nice trickle.",5
Pushes the paid bits way too hard and moves really slow if you aren't will to give the absurd amounts of money. If you only want to check on it every few days it can be fun. Just hard getting used to the really slow speeds as you reach higher levels.,2
"I stopped playing for a few months because my tablet broke but now it says checking updates forever but it even if you fix it the times to dig 1 block is 4 hours and gems are needed for everything so don't buy plz, k?",1
"The poster child of what is wrong with ""freemium"" games. Crashed twice during two separate raids!!!",1
Great tower defense!,5
Every time I try to name the dungeon it removes the key pad so I can't get passed tutorial,2
Grate,5
"Awesome game, only glitches I can see are some lag on my phone and connection troubles.",5
"Rating down until EA fixes the DC issue when imps need a slap. Until this is resolved, constantly reinstalling is the only fix. Not cool! Take an interest in your customers EA, and drop the scummy neglect.",1
Good game!!,4
Started the tutorial and got to the part for naming my dungeon. Pressing any keyboard key makes the keyboard disappear so I can't enter a name and can't get past that point of the game. Too bad...loved the original and this looks great.,1
I've been playing clash of clans for awhile and I'm liking this game better.,5
"Be very wary of updates, if there is one read comments to make sure it works.  Then update or you're locked out. Game is great when working... my rating is based on it being down, again!",4
"Of course they charge 50 bucks for a thing of gems. Smallest price for them is 5 dollars and then that will only last you one hours worth of building things.  5 dollars for 500 gems and the weakest ""hero"" is worth 800. What kind of bull is that. The game is purposely slow to make you spend money, and if you do buy anything it wont be a permanent unlock. Way better games out there.  Skip this one.",1
"The app is constantly having to go through loading screens and in some cases this can last several minutes (~7 minutes is not uncommon).  EA needs to address the transfer of data from their servers.  Also, when it finishes loading, it starts loading data again.  This is extremely annoying, especially when trying to raid someone",3
"Fun little game, only issue is keyboard doesn't work on android, nvidia shield. Any attempt to type closes keyboard, can't fill in name let alone chat in a guild.",4
"Pretty cool game, no dungeon is the same (thats obvious), fun, twisted, if your patient you won't have to spend much on upgrades...if your patient...keeper.",4
Well made graphics OK not great but good to the eye,5
"F2p for the most part, I've been playing for roughly a year.  To get the full experience you must join a guild",4
Get tower defense,5
this game is cool and awesome.,5
Terrible build times and expensive to skip,1
Laged a bit but is fun,4
Bad clash of clans knock off that doesn't do the dungeon keeper name justice.,1
DK was one of my all time favorite games and was excited when I saw an android version was comming but unfortunately this is the worst type of freemium game out there.  So very expensive. I would easily pay $10+ bucks for a remake of the origional.,1
EPIC GAME,5
"The old pc version was a bit better, but this is pretty close. Good game",5
LOVE DK,5
Better be ready to spend alot of $$$$ to play.,1
This game is beast,5
This is as much fun to play as DK or DK2 ever was!,5
I've played his game before but on an apple product and it was great then I switched to a droid maxx and now I've started over but after the tutorial I go to name my dungeon and the key bored goes away and I can't name my dungeon pls fix and I'll rate five stars,1
"EA bought out the original company, bullfrog, around the release of dungeon keeper 2 for PC. After purchasing the company they just sat on this game, never attempting to rebuild it for PC. It's sad to see this game being shelled out in an app store, using an in-app purchase system, and very little of the classic games mechanics or design. The original classic dungeon keeper has been crapped on by EA,  the decision to reincarnate this once life draining game as a mobile app was a harsh slap in the face.",1
Great game.  Solid graphics.  Wonderful sound effects and music.  Free ring tones?  Sweet!,5
"EA, level with me here. You just wanna swim in the money bin, don't you? I mean, there's nothing wrong with that, but did you need to slaughter one of the best IPs you have left to do it? I don't know about the rest of you, but when EA burns, I'll be there to point and laugh.",1
Awesome app new twist on old game,5
"Build a dungeon, defend against keepers... Sounds awesome, but poor connectivity issues coupled with poor in-game performance in contrast to other other titles offering similar gameplay mechanics makes it an annoying title to play. You can also regularly lose more resources than you can gather up through being attacked. Very frustrating, very unbalanced and a money-grab at best. Literally cannot progress further in later gameplay without paying for resources in-game using real cash. Be warned!",1
My favorite game in Google app form......awesome.,5
"Fun game but takes time, real time to get good.",5
"Guess many folks on here haven't played the original dungeon keeper games, stays true to the original game, yes it takes time to build stuff, but name a game now that doesn't, cost to build things quick",4
I CANT STOP PLAYING THIS,5
I played it be for on my pc,4
"It is early for a full rating, but it's good so far.",3
"Needs more components,  I got bored quick on this one. Good game though.",3
Good time,5
Awesome strategy game and comical.,5
One of my favorite games made portable,5
Please fix this!,1
I miss the baby alien looking imps. Shooting and flying over walls seems unrealistic to the dank & completely underground idea.,5
Completely ruined dungeon keeper.,1
Great app,5
"I got addicted to this game, just like all the other dungeon keepers I have played. The problem is, when I try to open the game now, it says ""checking for updates"" and stays on that screen forever without loading. I have spent money on this game and I want it fixed or my money back!",1
Very fun game,4
IT IS ASOME!!!!!!!,5
Nothing but a money grubbing waste of time,1
It is a good enough game,5
Fix the rearranging ability and I will rate higher stars,4
Great,5
"Very fun and continued play. Unable to search in guild search, keyboard disappears when I try to type.",4
Name wouldn't let me type to when the name meanu pops up,4
"By far my favorite game to play of all time, good graphics and smooth gameplay, I don't know what I would change about it, its all to perfect!",5
"Very enjoyable app, I like the dungeon ,traps and monster aspects of it...it is like most apps though with prompts to buy gems but not needed.",5
"I haven't played with guilds yet, but overall this game very much has the feel of the originals.",5
I used to play the pc version. This captures the spirit of the game perfectly.,5
At all the complaining on reddit. Its a mobile game. Deal.,5
Its like you're a in  charge....!!!!,5
Amazingly addictive and awsome,5
I would have given more but it locks up after every battle,3
Love it!!,5
Great game so far.,5
"I love this series. Ive played since the first one, however, the keyboard dismisses itself when clicked. I can't type a name to create a new clan. Please fix this.",4
"Too sensitive to connections. I play on a mobile device, expect most people do. Any significant lag or connection change and you fail a raid. Tired of building a raid and having it fail 30 seconds in. Fix this and I'd rate 4 or 5.",2
Its just like the old version I had for PC I do love evil,4
"Not as good as the original pc version, long load times, but a good app",4
Loved the x86 game. It's 1990's all over. Used to love this on the comp. Hope it lives up to its rep.,5
"The game play is fine/fun but the game randomly crashes all the time. This is especially annoying when attacking as there are bonuses for winning streaks. Was going to buy some gems, now glad that I didn't.",3
A little time consuming on builds and hard to start up but great game !,4
"I have played somewhat, unfortunately when it comes to naming my dungeon it won't allow it. I tried to type it in, but every time I tried to enter it, it just closes the keyboard out. UPDATE: looks like this bug has been around for a while. So those of you who have androids should know that they have not released any kind if fix for it yet and no telling when and if they will at all.",2
"Everything you have to wait for is absurdly long,and it flaunts constantly about micro transactions. Complete garbage considering you can't advance in the game without wasting a year or two.",1
Game breaking bug,1
If you like conquer & defend games it's better than most of them. Dialog was great & game played smooth. But I'm not that into them personally lol,5
All they care about is money if you dont know they basically put micro transactions in every game and the item that you need in this case gems will cost money real!!! Money!!! This game sucks. EA stop making us pay for things that are useful plus this isnt even close to being like the original dungeon keeper waste of time and space,1
Sick and tired of it. keep saying every few min of game play that the imps has to get dungeon in order,1
Build times increase exponentially and quickly. Gems come very slowly. Definitely could take months just to get 4th imp without spending $$ or micromanaging. Still a fun game if you're into set it and forget it style build and fight defense games.,3
I ove this game . I download it a while ago and got a new phone and I wanted to restart my game but don't know how! Please help and I'll give 5 stars,2
"The game is not what was on pc l, it's close to it but I don't like the way it's played now, I miss digging out the dungeons with legions of imps",3
A bit different than the PC version but still a good game.,5
Over all fun game even the load is interactive.  Takes some time to understand how everything works but the wait is worth it,5
Too much of a time sink for my taste,1
Like the game it seems fun but I can't enter a dungeon name it won't pull up keyboard or anything would like it fixed as soon as its fixed. I will reinstall the game and give it a better rating....,1
"Nexus 5: Unable to name dungeon, the keyboard always disappear. Fix it and I may give it another try.",1
"no fun here,, pay upfront for a game that doesnt have ""in app purchasing"" or nothing at all,,, getting old EA, grow up!!!",1
really bad,1
Meh,1
"Would probably be a great game if it wasn't called dungeon keeper and use horny to think you going to play the old style dungeon keeper. Very confusing, pay walls everywhere... Take a tip from the PC game dungeon 2. About the best dungeon like game I've seen",1
Moves fast...few real issues!!,5
It is super fun... Didn't ever glitch.AWESOME!,5
Stuck! Can't input dungeon name.,1
"So much potential! But, resource quantities and ratios are inaccurate, and building your dungeon is difficult. If a game is optimized for building a tactical base, then more helpful setting should be applied for in game use to make the building more efficient.",3
Wish it was like the old Dungeon Keeper for the PC a lot more fast paced and fun but overall a good rehash,4
Can't name my dungeon because the screen keyboard disappears every time I try use it.,2
"Ive seen people play this looks like a grat game but it wont connect to  the  server, will change the  rating when i can play",1
Great,5
Not bad. Offense spells are a bit too powerful so game is not balanced√± but still entertaining.,4
"Played the original games, really miss ""killing the good"". Other than this apparent omission, it's fun.",4
Sooo much fun! :D,5
Always lagging and reloading. I would love it but getting kicked in the middle of battle is very annoying,3
Best mobile game ever.,5
"The game itself is great. However, it will cut out in the middle of a raid often enough to be annoying, especially as it thinks that you ""forfeited"" it, and marks it up as a loss.",4
Hmm,5
Classic game I remember but with a few modern twists.     Revision.....  Seriously EA you guys make 4 billion last year and can't get a server good enough to go 10 minutes without kicking me off?,4
it is so much fun,5
good game,4
I've seen this on YouTube so I'm going to give it a try.,3
When I first try to log into the game it freezes when the imp drops down only being able to see his two tiny feet and a hand then it says unfortunately dungeon keeper has stopped. This game is complete rubbish.,1
Fun game,5
"Everytime I play or do something, it would do it but I dont see anything after that. I would have to restart the game just to play. I used to love this game but its too annoying.",2
Game doesn't always load for my tablet please fix the problem,5
But there's a chat bug that makes it unpleasant,5
I can only launch game once in every 30-40 attempts. Uninstalled.,2
"Really cool game. I first thought this was another trickle economics app, but you do not need to perpetually purchase anything to enjoy this. It is close enough to the original PC version that I want to reload the PC version and see.",5
Simple easy to get into and nothing is forcing a cost on you to play,5
Not bad,4
Great,5
"Game is great, only complaint is that air defenses should be made available sooner, keep getting mauled by the dragon immortal.  Better yet get rid of the flying units all together. This game takes place underground in a cave, does it not?  Kind of defeats the whole purpose of building an awesome maze of traps if they can just fly to your dungeon heart.  Other than that have invested many fun hours plotting my maze of death, watching replays of invaders, and raiding others.",5
"Well, I wanted to start over so I created a new account but couldn't name my new dungeon because every time I  clicked the keyboard to name my new Dungeon it was going away. So I came back to my old one and I am lost will all the new content. PLEASE HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM ! I CANT WRITE MY NEW DUNGEON NAME!!!",3
"Resources and build times/costs are way to skewed toward the ""spend money or wait 13 hours for the resources to build something then 15+ to build it while you're being attacked by other players who have been spending money like water and are therefore better than you"" model of game in short it sucks ducks dont download.",2
Very good game.Mwahahahahaaaaa!,4
I love this game!!!!!!!!,5
A new version of a old game,5
"I also got stuck and could not enter my dungeon name, would like to try the game",2
Its to awsome i.cant kep .up with.my wordnssjdrjddjdilosnebeje,5
I loved it,5
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
I'm use to games like this because I play COC. So I enjoy this game for now,4
EA ruined the series,1
"continually locks up on kitkat. cant swipe imps, when i do it keeps sayin upgrade complete n reconnecting. please fix! still disconnecting an reconnecting when i try to smack imps!!  please fix!!!",2
Great free game.,5
"The mobile version of the classic Dungeon Keeper reduces it from a creature-sim/strategy game to a tower defense game. Careful planning of dungeon patching and attack strategies will get you ahead and can make gameplay more fun Pressure to buy and use gems is annoying. What is more annoying, however, are the disconnects. Regardless on whether I am on WiFi or not, the game disconnects all the time. Oddly enough, the frequency of dropouts increased the higher I got in the ladder. Now logging in is impossible.",2
Thank nerdcubed he helped me find this app,5
Great game is so much like the original PC game!,5
Fun game,5
Very addictive and awesome you can customize your dungeon,5
I used to lay he computer version of this back in highschool. Still has the same feel to it and thoroughly enjoy it,4
Very cool,5
This is nothing like the original game like come on its a game for the 90's it was a great game and then you made it a big piece of crap with MICRO TRANSACTION,1
Graphics are gud and it never gets boring it takes a lil time upgrading but well worth it if we had more people on it im sure the real fun would go begin the creators should put a commercial out just like clash of clans im sure everyone would switch to this instead,5
"I do agree that this is not what we grow up with, still this is to me is a job well done. Also this game requires waiting, so inpatient gamers beware.",4
I love slapping the imps to make them work faster,5
An amazing game,5
I dig it. Fun and plenty to do.,5
"I remember the original DK on PC, hours upon hours of gameplay. Sad that a classic title has fallen victim to the ""buy your builders"", ""freemium"" business model. I'd much rather give em $20 for a real game, the way it used to be.",3
"This is just so boring. Disregarding the long waiting times, this game is just SOOOO SLOW!",2
"In true EA fashion, resource costs and time to build is waaaaaaay too long in an effort to get you to spend money on stuff. Would like to play more but 3 or more hours for an upgrade means I open it, start a task and close it.",3
"Hi daddy it's Issa Face and I love,love love love and loved it but not as much as you. ;) and :)",5
"I was a big fan of the original PC games, so I had high expectations going in. I was not disappointed.",5
Poor combat selection system allows higher level players to power level up players that don't wish to level quickly,1
Game seems fun from the tutorial but it won't let me input a dungeon name. When I go to use my keyboard it makes it go away and there no generic system to skip and rename later. If I can get a fix I'll give a much better review and I'm sure it'll be 5 stars,2
If it wasn't for the glitch about naming the dungeon this would be an awesome game.,3
I can't even start playing it! It told me to give it my name but it won't let me type in anything!,1
awesome game... good old times in dos mode. so far only issue I have is the hang time on loading.  quick fix is to log out and relunch the app. kudos,4
Loading please wait. .... Always breaks while trying to play. Frustratingly broken,1
"In essence a clsh of clans clone, however loaded with all the fun, over the top dark humor that made the original games so amusing. Still would love dugeon keeper three, but this will do for now.",4
Can't even type in anything when it wants me to name it.....idk what to do...and can't move on with no name,1
Is so cool,5
"This is one of the worst examples of pay to play ""Free"" games ever, WHY are we supporting micro transactions.  Man this crap makes me angry.   DO NOT download this game, waste of time and money, and even if you want to pay it is not as good as the original.",1
But I still like it as much. Fun fun fun,5
"Hours of fun, great nod to the original.",5
I'll give it 5,5
"Keyboard for naming dungeons is incredibly glitchy. Otherwise, very fun! (Droid Turbo)",4
"Hours of fun, great on the tablet. Excellent nod to the original.",5
Pretty good at passing time and very adictive,4
"Having fun so far, haven't made it to guild stuff yet.  Gems can get pricey or you can choose to wait out the overly long upgrade times.",4
"Very confusing on what has to be done, besides buying gems.",5
I played the original on the computer many years ago always enjoyed designing and destroying the hero's. Not to bad still miss the original tho.,5
Disconnects on my 2012 Nexus 7 every time I attempt to start trying minion level up. Works fine however on my Note 3.,1
I love this game on the PC and I got to the part when u make a name and It won't let me make one my keyboard keeps closing,1
The game doesn't start =(,1
When naming the dungeon.,1
Great,5
The game is wonderful,3
I love this game. Haven't played it in a wile and just got back and just destroyed some people. Forget how good I was.,5
"4 stars because the game itself is fun and attractive, although for the fifth star it would have to be a little less buggy, startup loading screen has crashed probably 20% of the time. Pvp also drops quite often making you lose the monsters you just waited 45 minutes to summon... Also wanted to mention this game is quite a resource hog.",4
Gooood,5
Best smartphone game,5
&gt;using meme arrows,5
best  game ever  i thoght  it waa something  dumb  like  clash of  clans  or something  but no it is amazing  download  this game !,5
Great game! Would recomend this game to everybody!!!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,4
Spam your friends! Spend lots of money! Many minutes of enjoyment per day. Then pay more or wait till tomorrow! Don't forget to give them money!,2
Love this game,5
Its cool after you get started,4
"A nice game that is similar to the original classic. So far no complaints. I give it 5 stars now because, for a freemium game, it exceeds my expectations.",5
It so fun!!!!!!,5
Really fun game A+,5
The game itself is fun but took me forever to get past naming my dungeon. Has stopped and booted me out or simply froze a handful of times in the hour and a half I've been playing.,3
this game is awesome i love it!,5
"Good time consumer,fun,and good idea with the imp slapping  XD",5
"I am on a Lg G3 running lollipop and when I get to the part where you name the dungeon, my keyboard does not work, whenever I try to type the keyboard disappears then comes back still not typing anything.  I loved these games for the PC, would love to play more of the android version.            ***FIXED***Used a different keyboard and had no problem then.",5
Been playing for about 3 weeks now and I don't really have any complaints. I like that the resources are easy to collect and level up. Gems are a lot easier to obtain than other games similar to this one. EA has another hit.,5
This dk   is a fun fresh version from the original. I do kinda wish you could possess the minions like the original game. ..but not a bad way to waste time,4
Kick a@@@,5
I'll rate this higher when I can name my dungeon. It won't let me progress due to keyboard not responding in game on my Droid Turbo.,1
I love to the original games and this one promises to be grand as well.,5
"Nothing like the PC, but still Good.",4
Use to love this game but now it crashes every battle and I lose all attackers for nothing,4
Love the app. Great time killer would love to be able to earn more gems and should have an option to earn free gems after the challenges are done or until able to get to certain challenges.,5
Love this version as well.,5
Loved it so much,5
I really like the game but lately i keep getting.. Loading... Please wait while imps get dungeon in order..  Loading.  Error connecting etc. Only after i got 4 imps have i had this issue. Game was great before i bought imps.,1
Despite the game not being as bad as when it first released its still painfully obvious it wants you to spend as much money as you can on gems. I am not a whale.,1
Over all its an enjoyable time sink when you have 30 mins here or there.,4
Wanted a dungeon keeper game got clash of clans but worse.,1
"I want to give this game a higher rating, it seemed really fun, but when it asks what to name my dungeon, when I try typing in a name on my  keyboard, it closes when I open my keyboard again to type it, it closes again. It's rather frustrating I want to play the game and give a higher review but I can't at this point in time.  Edit: I got it to work I had to switch keyboards and I was able to type in the game again.",5
It was decent,5
Funny stuff nice work,5
What a blast,5
Stays at the update screen with no progress on either Data Network or Wifi connection. Galaxy S4,5
The imps boost really dosnt make them dig fast just run fast. And they cost WAY too much. Build times and dig times or kinna reallistic would of liked the lvl 2 traps to be fast builds.. Its a nice change from clash of clans still.,3
"The game has changed after patches. There's enough to play with what's provided and a mechanism for accessing all the other sections without making a payment. It is easier with some purchases but not required. Having played both DK1 and DK2, this is more like a throwback version. That's not to say its not any fun just bear in mind that its built as a mobile game. That said, the most frustrating part is the server connection. There are periods when it continually disconnects which leads to interrupted raids that can lead to losing a spot in tournaments. Be prepared to have your dungeon raided by higher level players. The game does not scale well in tournaments so beating a new guy is as good as getting a moderate victory over a comparable opponent. Originally Id give a 4 now with more freq d/c more like 2 to 3.",2
I'm wondering why it's only 500k people if you haven't tried this game I recommend you play it peace out,5
"Would love to actually play the game, but I can't get the keyboard to work when naming the dungeon. I have a Droid Turbo. Please fix!",1
"Can't get past ""name dungeon"" does not work on lolipop.",1
"Stays in touch with the original, nicely done",5
"I think it takes a little long to load, but it's fun nonetheless!",5
This is first time I laughed since 6 months ago,5
Interesting twist on an old favorite. Will be fun to play around with it.,4
"I heard a lot of negative stuff about this game, but I like what I've played. It's simple, and quite entertaining. I have a high tolerance for free to play games, so I can ignore purchasing stuff :p It's simple, slap the imp, dig a hole, put some cannon traps down and throw some trolls at a random player. Give it a shot, it's free.",4
"I got this to play with my friend. I decided at one point to buy gems and when I did my money never showed up in the game. I reported the issue and they refused to help me out. There goes 25$, thanks jerks.",2
Yeah buddy get this stat,5
"Always loved the series, been real fun so far",5
This thing my dad told me to play. So i tried it out. And now I can't stop playing it! Best game ever 10/10,5
Not like the original game of the 1990s. This new form of gaming sucks. Takes so long to make any progress and what's with all the in app purchases?,1
The only dungeon the makers of this epic failure should be making is one they put themselves in FOREVER!!! I think a blind monkey with a drinking problem randomly typing code would have done a better job.,1
Fun!,5
Took long time to download then it updated when I opened it then it loads and kicks me out,1
"Can't even play! Game crash's right after title screen, pathetic!",1
best game I've ever seen,5
"While this game is definitely not as good as the 1990s cult classic, it is an OK mobile game and would recommend it to anyone who has not played the originals. Also I bet that most of the people playing this game didn't Even know that there was an original",4
Love this game but my keyboard wont show up when it asks dungeon name. So i cant progress from there,3
It is downloading now And it is fun to play,5
Just started.  Used to play the old one on pc.  Playing on galaxys5.  Only issues I've been having are connection problems and loading sometimes.  Will add more when I'm higher lvl.,4
Please fix the keyboard issue I'm still at the beginning where it asked for a name and every time I try to type anything it minimizes. I'm using a Kyocera and it's a great near top of the line phone. I LOVED the original Pc version of the game,1
Slap an imp!,5
THIS GAME IS FRAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!,5
Great stuff!,4
Really enjoy this game.  Great time waster and doesn't require you to spend real money to get the most out of it.  Definitely recommend.   Good job EA!,5
Played this game as a kid originally on pc this game owns and is fun throughout don't be fooled by the in game purchases it's only for convenience you can earn currency and don't need to have extra stuff to have fun in this game,5
Fix this keyboard bug I'm using a nexus 5 and every time I try to type a name for my dungeon it won't let me I was having fun now I'm just fed up ...... Been waiting over a month for this to be fixed and have scince told everyone that its not worth the trouble fix it and I will be happy because it is a good game just horrible staff working with it ... Thanks.   PS went online and I'm not the only person having this problem poor customer service,1
"Slow, unlike the originals but awesome.",5
When ever I try to use the app it says error and wont let me play. When this is fixed I will rate higher.,1
Lots of fun. Way better than I thought it would be.,5
"App takes forever to load, and when attacking other players dungeons, freezes up, tries to load, but eventually takes you back to your home dungeon with all your minions killed.",1
The game is fun and i really enjoy it though the troop capacity could be greater,5
I loved the dungeon keeper series. I love this app,5
Love it. The game is so cool,5
Killer game by far one of my favorite#$!#$&* games I own bar none,5
Love this game.  It is the best game in the world if it was not created then what would I play in a evil or devious mood,5
"I love this game, I also love the original PC game and still have it. Have to fix laptop in order for me to play it but the last couple days the game has kicked me out and is loading a lot. I'll be playing and next thing I know it says imps are fixing my dungeon. Please fix. I'm getting of not being able to play for long periods of time. I only get to play 5 minutes before it kicks me off.",5
"It won't even let me name my dungeon after the tutorial...lame, I loved this game on the old PC.",1
I try to make a name then my get kick out,1
I like this game so far.  Still trying it out.,4
Time it takes to do things is just way too long. It just takes to ling to be able to accomplish anything significant.,4
Loving an old game reboot,4
Wonderfully Evil,5
A lot of fun!,4
Great,4
Pay to play,1
"My main complaint is the keyboard bug, I managed to get past it by naming it ttt, because that was the only key I could find that wouldn't minimize it. Otherwise it's fun so far.",4
"Just started a few days ago,  but it's great so far.  Not based on money grabs and solid humor.",5
"I can not open the game, and when it does open, it keeps force closing after a raid. I'm using a Verizon Moto X (2013). It works fine on my tablet when I'm at home.",1
Awesome,5
When i zoom in or out during a raid the graphics start glitching out to become seizure inducing please fix.,2
"I'm faithful to this game.  I'm on it at least daily, if not more often.  Considering that I'm fairly busy most days, that's something.  It's the ONLY game I play regularly.",5
"DK has it's funny side, as a game though, it lacks balance. Easy to get a third imp free through achievements, fourth imp free takes alot of patience and alot of digging. League PvP is poorly thought out, and has extremely low levels vs extremely high level players. So to take this game seriously, and spend money on it? Can't say I would.",3
Not as good as original pc game,1
Crap game with horrible amount of pay time and little control of minions.,1
It's a good game.I enjoy it.but I can't download the patch for some reason it tries but stays at 0% please fix this problem.,3
This game reminds me of the pc,5
"I grew up playing dk2, this falls extremely short of it.",3
Great game,5
Lots of fun,5
Best,5
This app has bugs to where I can't name my dungeon and continue. Makes me thing downloading this was a mistake. Uninstalled and bad rating.,1
Play,5
Its a great game and if you don't know what complating is watch swoozie,5
Dungeon keeper is the best,5
I just started playing DK but when I try to name my dungeon but I can't touch any letters but I can touch the submit but it never submit. I NEED HEEEELP,3
I would check it out if I were you,4
"I would give it 5 stars if they would fix the programming so it would allow you return to a raid-in-progress after an unintentional disconnect, instead of just ending it as an automatic loss. It's EXTREMELY frustrating.",4
Not dungeon keeper like it used to be,1
"The game that meets hell to hell ""evil laugh""",5
Yawn............,2
More fun than you think,5
One of the best,5
When I was littler I used to play this game on the computer alot and this game is an amazing representation,5
Meh,3
"Good game, runs smoothly on my galaxy 5",5
Good game but still has bugs,5
This is a game.,5
Its good so far can't wait to see more,4
"At first I thought it would be extremely monotonous,  but it's way better than first anticipated.    Love playing it now and I am on many times a day.",5
Nope. Thanks anyway.,1
"You guys had to add transactions? Just let us buy cosmetical things, like a different dungeon theme. The game is unbalanced, and takes much more longer to dig a block, at least lower it by 30 minutes. Game is addicting as it's meant to be, but all around, the game is awkward, EA needs to bring it to Origin.",3
Fun,5
"Some parts of the terain in your dungeon takes a day to mine out when dungeon keeper is supposed to be a real time stratagy game.and everything that made dungeon keeper great to begin with has been craped on,nuked and trown out the window and replaced with a micro transaction.EA you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this abomination.and I hope that the bullfrog team comes back and see's what you have done to this beloved franchise.it would actualy be cheeper to go on good old games  and get dungeon keeper one and two for ten bucks or somthing like that.",1
Words cannot explain the cancer EA has brought to gaming,1
Every time i try to raid another player my game crashes almost every other raid. You want my money? Fix this garbage. I'm losing gems after resupplying and I'm missing out on stars and resources. This is ridiculous.,1
Not nearly as good as the original PC games.,3
"The game is fun but there are lots of flaws. My biggest problem with the game is the balancing. There is none, is what it feels like. All the higher leveled players have to do is send in ONE flying unit to destroy your base because you can't build any Anti air and their unit is at max level. Even when you finally are able to level up to build an AA, its just ONE little missile, that does little damage. There is another air mine but u need to do a event battle to earn purple gem to build it! Please add more AA or AT LEAST don't let people be prone to be attack by players who have air units when they can't even build any type of AA defense.",2
: ),5
I justwished it was more easy to get those goblins or minions,5
"Too many confusing battle options, and talk of tournaments and guilds right after I started playing? Game keeps disconnecting for no reason, and the player dungeons you must attack are pretty lousy--what, you couldn't come up with a decent campaign mode?",2
"I have been playing for at least 8 months and I am absolutely addicted to it, it really is a great game except every once in a while it glitches mid battle and ruin my raid but other than that I love it.",5
It won't download,1
"Same as others, need to name dungeon, but keyboard just disappears when you touch it.",2
It's so good that I can't stop playing. üòà I still can't stop playing.üòàüëπüåã,5
This app is so awesome I feel like playing it 24\7,5
Good,5
Not as fun as the original issues with play and how to upgrade dungeon heart. I will go back to the original.,1
"My game wont load why,???",1
Although its got in app purchases (unlike the original) its a good game I've never seen anything like it its great!!,5
"Its a mix of Coc,PvZ,and balloon tower defense.Its amazing",5
I'm on Moto X I'm using the new android keyboard by Google. Your game is literally unplayable when the box comes up to give a name the keyboard can't be used I tap anything and the keyboard disappears. Please make your game work with all keyboards.,1
"There are common features of Dungeon Keeper, but this is not a DK game. This is EA attempting to cash in on the Keeper name. It's a flipping Facebook game that is skinned like Dungeon Keeper.",3
I love This dungeon,5
Great game!,4
I have looked everywhere for a version of the original game ..this may not be exactly like it but it's a ton of fun,4
Fun,5
"I have missed bullfrog games, hope to see theme hospital's return.   update:  i still like the game but after being maxed out it seems to take forever to get to the next level with the battle points.   but it is nice to go in do somethings and check on it at the end of the week.   i do tend to fear the updates because they seem to change the game play.",3
I can't stand the constant demand for microtransactions. It's to the point of asking oneself why even play. It's too bad to see what EA has done to a classic Bullfrog game..,2
"Still in the intro section. Game asks for a name for your dungeon. Clicking on keyboard minimizes it and pulls focus back into the game. Can't type, therefore can't continue. Phone: droid turbo.",1
Best game along side titans mobile,5
So much fun to play,5
"Runs like most Android games, reminds me of dungeon keeper on the PC, except you are always waiting for stuff to get done or spending money to get them done. Cave-ins have a timer but there is no way to know how long it is.",4
I paid 5 bucks to buy gem money was charged  but these guys didnt gave me gem or refund my money cant believe they did that,1
"Much like our beloved of Dungeon Keeper, but updated with modern ways for EA to make money. Playing without paying will require a ton of patience. Nice graphics though....",4
Mico transaction fest. Stay away.,1
Super fun. Slap the s**t out of those imps!,5
SWEEET!,5
I like the new pieces but.it's still glitchy,3
Great game you did a good job. But please improve the performance... the loading time are way too long,4
"After giving it a year, this sad excuse of a game has utterly failed to capture that essence that made DK so great all those years ago.  Stay away.",1
Finally a free to play game that is free to win. Just take your time on your dungeon.,5
I played the hell out of the first two real dungeon keepers and honestly this depressed me someone took the games I love and ripped every bit of heart out of it and then demanded 5 dollars a day,1
Never ending challenges,5
"""Unfortunately, Package Access Helper has stopped."" I haven't played for over a week.",1
"Great job in pushing the developers into a model that nobody likes and then shutting down said developers because no one liked it. The game is actually not bad at all. It's not at pay to play as people think, but thanks to EA's bungling this franchise is headed back to the grave.",3
Wish the scale of leveling was a bit more even,1
...but ultimately this game is pay-to-win. Usually most games with in-game purchases are fine to play if you have some patience -- not this one.,1
"Why does EA have to ruin every game that I love? Buy the original, it's cheap and amazing and it's just.....better.        Seriously, micro transactions, wait times? Stop ruining the gaming industry EA. Both you and Atari.",1
"And not bad at all, love it",3
"Almost as good as the original, but the pay to play will become extremely annoying, I'm sure.",2
"Based on reviews here, clearly you guys never play Clash of Clan and other castle defence game. Beside this is online game, what you guys expect? Please don't say that minion and flappy bird are online game, please keep your ignorance to your cave. And if you guys having trouble installing this game, cuz its 3d but your smartphone are expensive... so I guess you don't deserve a smartphone becouse you an idiot.",4
Game seems fairly good but the prices shoot up very fast to encourage you to buy gems to continue playing.,4
"I purchased both dk 1 & 2 when they first came out. I can honestly say this ""game"" doesn't hold a candle to either. In fact, it doesn't have a view of where the originals took a leak.",1
A tragedy,1
"When the ""Rate My Game Plz"" popup comes up it gives you 2 options, 5 stars and 4-1 stars. If you rate 4-1 stars it takes you to a feedback page and doesn't allow you to rate any lower. Even if you give the feedback page they never read it and the rating doesn't go through. That is shady as hell and the only way around that to say anything bad is to rate it directly here.",1
I hated it,1
Not just the succubus gets tortured. My memories of the original will never recover from this travesty.,1
Ya I've only been playing for a few hours but I tell you it's an excellent game I find it rather cute and fun I like how you can slap the imps to make them work faster thanks for an amazing game,5
Amazing.. Great updated game,5
When I'm in a raid my minions turn into their corresponding icons instead of what they're supposed to be. Please fix!,4
"This game is really slow with no pays. Over a year now, still losing every battle.",1
Complete crap,1
"Another free game that quickly hits a wall unless you pay for ""gems""",1
Entertaining for what it is.,4
Crap,1
"Micro transactions sucked the life out of the game.   shady review practices, Google it.",1
"Fun ,fun",5
"A slap in the face for Dungeon Keeper fans. Designed to bleed money from users. It's nothing but micro transactions, for everything. HORRIBLE!!!",1
Only complaint so far...loading   times too many and too long,5
Not worth it just play Clash of Clans,1
"To make it big in this game, you have to have at least 4 imps. Other than that, don't rely on defense, the best way to win in this game is to RAID RAID RAID!!!",5
It cost to much for minions in this game to get everything done for you and you would have to buy gems to get more,3
Its like clash of clans but better,5
"I love the game, but no matter what I do it won't let me submit my dungeon name, it won't even let me type it. How am I supposed to play when its not going to allow me to name my dungeon?!?!?! Please fix!!!!üò¨üò¨üòà",1
Not bad! Reminiscent of days past.,4
Loved this game. Needs ninjas.,5
Loves it,5
"This game is a lot of fun, the only problem I have is the fact that you lose all of the minions that you have on a raid even if they don't die, if this is fixed I would give five stars!",3
"This is not the PC game, folks, sorry. It is still a fun game of strategy and silliness with your favorite Horny devil! And who doesn't like smacking imps around once in a while?",5
Just so much fun trying to keep your area secure,5
"I like alot when it 1st came out,don't  like that you made it a pay to win game",3
"Of course it's completely different than the old PC game. I'm seeing a lot of  negative comments here , whining about how it's nothing like the original game. Well, DUH! It's an android app ya Idjuts!  Yeah I wasn't thrilled at first, but I actually gave the game a shot and was pleasantly surprised . Now I'm hooked!",5
THIS IS AN INSULT TO DUNGEON KEEPER AND DOESNT DESERVE TO EXIST,1
Cool and exciting,5
It is filled with so many micro transactions I can't even play. I want the old dungeon keeper back,1
N/a,3
"This great game has fun battles, good strategy, and cool graphics. It also doesn't stall out like so many games do in order to get you to pay. I highly recommend it.",5
Great for 15 minute games with hours in between letting timers run. Impatience will cost you gems. Well balanced gameplay with strong strategy component.,5
You gotta think hard an make your choices wisely,5
It's pretty dope,5
Although it's not like the original it's still entertaining and runs smoothly,4
Cool game,5
Not quite what i was expecting but an ok game so far,3
This is a typical pay to play. the first 30 min is kinda fun then it is just a grind. :( Not fun,1
Plays like clash of clans or throne rush or similar games. Has dungeon keeper characters an rooms,4
Awesome Just Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Was a great game until it stopped working.  It will no longer let me take part in any kind of raids or defense. I get into it and it won't register any of my taps.,2
"I don't know how EA manages to ruin every game they touch, but they are consistent.  They took a fun, unique game and turned it into a micro-transaction heavy, slow turd.  Just go to G O G (dot) c o m and get the real thing for under three bucks.  I love DK, but this game sucks.",1
"For what it is, it is a good app, I don't spend money on it but still find it entertaining, you just need patience.",5
Love multiplayer,4
Loved this game from when it first came out on pc.,5
You can get a lot further in this game without having to Pay To Win like you do in Clash of Clans. IMO.,5
Fun game,5
Automatically changes your ringtone to DK rap... That's retarded so uninstalled. Will try again in a year.   This ruins the dungeon keeper experience and is horribly designed to get you to spend more money than the original game cost.,1
"The game is entertaining, but it would be nice to forever opt out of raiding. The only way to do this is through an in-app purchase and it doesn't last long, not cool. Raiding doesn't interest me, but building my dungeon does.",4
Best game around,5
Not  the pc version but meets my needs,5
Micro transactions are pure evil,1
"If anyone actually thinks this game is good, then the world is full of idiots. Best value 100$?",1
This is a really cool game! I love it.,5
Ea sports you did a fantastic job on this game,5
Graphics are good. Game play is good. You will have to get used to waiting for upgrades to complete.  Otherwise have fun raiding!,4
Would be 5 stars if I could just play it like the 90s pc version. Waiting and coming back is not as fun,4
Fix your game!! Great game but I can't get past the tutorial as when I go to type in the dungeon name the keyboard shrinks back down no matter which I tap! And typical EA probably won't even see this review or care to see it!!!,2
"This isn't a game. It's a scam. While the ""gameplay"" is fun and addicting, it becomes more and more difficult to play it without buying ""gems"" to get rid of time restrictions. It can take 24 hours to dig out a 3x3 room. 24 FLIPPING HOURS!!!!! That's grotesque. A prime example of ""freemium"" trash made solely to leech money out of any players ignorant enough to throw away their cash. Stay far far away from this ""game"", and tell everyone you know to stay far far away.",1
Awesome!!,5
"I got this to get away from the hacking in Clash of Clans, but EA's love of money over good gameplay is ruining this. I'm in a league I didn't earn by just defending myself, and now I can't continue at any pace without pumping money into the game; which I won't do because I hate EA. Thanks for ruining something else for me.",2
I ve enjoying playing since it 1st realse !!!! Keep it up,5
When starting out invest free gems in imps,4
"It's a different take on the old title. But this is pretty original, and fun. Great for anyone who doesn't have time to grind on a game. You don't need $$$ to enjoy this game.",5
Its awesome,4
Game can't run for more than 2 minutes without crashing or going into a reload loop.,1
Great game Liked a lot.,5
Awesome!,5
"Just an attempt to make money off an old loved IP. it's like a CEO's idea of a video game.  It's just a Clash of Clans clone with Dungeon Keeper slapped on the front. Don't waste your time, because even if that DID appeal to you, it would take you months to get remotely far in the game since everything is pay to win.  Overall, save yourself the disappointment and go play something else.",1
Fun to play,5
Sadisticly Fun.,4
So far this game has been great. Hope it keeps getting better,5
Entertaining no real complaints smacking the minions is always a good stress reliever,5
It is fun to me because it is such a big strategy game I like how much you have to think when you're in a battle because you have to know where or when to place your troops also to everyone that's saying that this is a clash of clans clone this was out  before clash of clans,5
"Fun, time-wasting game. Connection is a little unstable, but that seems to be on my end.",4
Takes me back when I was playing on a pc in my parents basement lol,5
Great game,3
I have dungeon keeper 2 for desktop and I love it.,5
Cool,5
Very fun n addictive. Great redux of a classic,5
Very similar to the computer game.  It's well designed.,4
"Loved the original on PC, and now I can take it with me and link up with friends.",5
So far its fun and funny. Haven't played for too long yet though,5
STOP PUTTING YOUR UPDATES IN THE CACHE.,1
"Seems to disconnect in the middle of raids and there is no way to make up for the lost objects such as minions, coins etc. Fun game, until you get sent back to your dungeon mid battle with no way to recover, even if you are winning. Had to give it a worse rating since I can never make up a battle that was lost due to ‚Äúimps getting my dungeon ready"". Very annoying bug.",1
Nifty to pass the time with,4
Best played so far,5
It sux,2
"Glad to see an old pc game become an app.  I give it a 3 star, graphics are great, but with WiFi in full bars it lags tremendously, but switch to 3g or higher, say 4g LTE it helps. And what happened to the possession spell?",3
Nothing is more satisfying than slapping around some minions.,5
Was here when it came out. It sucked then and hasn't changed. Oh wait my bad. It did. And now it's worse.,1
"It's a lot of fun for it's type, definitely  not your average rpg. Still it keeps you coming back.",5
Error code 15 your imps still not on it,1
So addictive,5
"Game kept crashing when I would try and raid. I would get 10 seconds into the raid, it would freeze and I would get a message that the imps are cleaning up the dungeon. I would get marked as a loss and loose the invested minions, mana, trophies and winning streak. The game is no fun being stuck as a farm for others. I am uninstalling not waste the time and patience any more.",1
Dont waste your time. Its standard EA paywall trash.,1
I love the game but it keeps kicking me back to my dungeon in the middle of raids. It's costing me bucket loads of gems to get my minions back and  I can't get to a point to upgrade my heart to the next level or move past where I'm at.,3
Petty good game,3
"It's still full of several minor bugs, but it's very fun, decently true to Dungeon Keeper, and even the voice actor sounds like the original. What can be frustrating, though, is how you can be attacked by high level flying minions, etc. and not even be at a level yet that the game lets you defend AT ALL. You just get slaughtered over and over again, have your money stolen, and can't do anything about it.",4
"Self-referential, pokes fun at EA as well as itself as a series. Obligatory 'god' currency, (gems) seem less stingy than other mobile games. Not hating it as much as I thought. Bullfrog is still on my mind. If i have to make a reference to the game, it would be something like Bullfrog being rotting in the graveyard amd EA being the vampire that rises because of it. Overpowered but not without it's weaknesses.",3
A fun game with both attack and defense missions.  The artistic aspects aren't the greatest.,4
Super great game,5
"Not much like the old one, but entertaining",4
Its pretty awsome to have a dungeon and ips to expand it and even name your dungeon I recomend it for clash of clans fans,5
Everything adout it is awesome!,5
Yea,5
Great game very funny,4
This game requires months of patience or a fat wallet to get any enjoyment out of it.,1
"No way to compete with paying players, tried for a few months finally grew tired uninstalled today, done with it.",1
I didnt think it was possible to make this game worse but EA managed in succeeding.  The game is no longer even playable. Full bars on wifi and cant even complete a battle without a message poping up that imps are getting my dungeon in order. This means the battle was ended in the middle of it due to EA's horrible servers. Tried other tablets and other wifi locations but the issue remains,1
EA transitioned this to tablet very well. Good voice overs.,5
Very fun and mischievous game!,4
Loved it,5
Game,4
It won't download,1
"This game just had the name and the way the character looks, other them that, the game play is no where near the real Dungeon  keepers. Don't like that other can attack.",1
Lots of lags,5
Petty good!,5
"Played the old one for the pc, it came along way",5
"You can't call it micro transaction if it exceeds 5 dollors. You shouldn't  have to pay to win at a game. I want to play the real dungeon keeper, were you don't have to pay more than its real price.",1
It is cool,5
"Review wasn't done, didn't hit submit.  Three times my phone has forcibly restarted while restructuring my dungeon leaving my heart exposed. My battery nowhere near low at the time, phone was plugged in last time. Every single time my dungeon was attacked at the exact minute my phone shut down.                   I still wouldn't have seen the connection if it wasn't for the app losing connection every other time I was attacked when playing!",1
Cash grab,1
Can't get past the naming of the dungeon and emailing ea is a joke,1
After a year of waiting it seems like they fixed alot of issues I had with it then. Problem with air units: any attack disrupts their own attack.  Doesnt matter where its from. Kinda bullshit programming on ea's part. Goes to show that EA is headed down the toilet.  Can't even make an app. Balanced.,2
Slow reconnect,3
Loved the pc version and love this one too if only you could make imps easier to get it would be much better,5
The IAPs cost 4-5 times what they should be. I would never pay that much for a game on my phone :-/,3
I enjoy it. Scares the crap out of me when my phone is up and reminders are on. Lol,4
nice graphics well explaned its a plasure to play it.,5
Great game when if was on the p.c. and still is a great game,5
It is better to see this as its own game,4
"I would of gave it a 5 but don't like the wait times to build.  Too used to the original, instant build and not waiting days for everything.",4
Awesome,5
Flawless,5
You have to pay to do anything.,1
"Higher level no fun for F2P, wasted 6 mos",3
always bothering you for gems and it gets increasingly boring,2
"I enjoyed the of version, and missed playing it. This takes me back!",5
I think its awesome cant get enough of it,5
"If you played Dungeon Keeper, and enjoyed it, then this is the game for you. Same great game, same awesome voice. Now you get to play against other people.  This game requires patience though.  If you want to play fast paced, this isn't for you.  Sometimes it'll take a while before getting to build each room.  If you spend money, thing move faster--but who wants to spend money on intangible things?  Only thing I don't like is the cutesy, bubbly graphics.  Other than that, great app.",5
Great game,5
Micro-transaction lol. Just to clear the map of dirt takes a literally 24 per tile times 300-400 aka a literal year. Or pay like $500! Yay! Ya deleted this game after three days. It's one click a tile and don't play for 24 hours..... amazingly fun!,1
This game rocks !,5
The game requires you to attack other players to advance. There is NO option to just build your dungeon.,3
It won't let me type in my name so I can't play it it is annoying,1
This game is just as fun as it was when it first came out idk why people are saying you gotta pay cash for stuff.,5
Just had my imps reset back to 1. This game is crap,3
"While the game itself is fun, I have played many Clash of Clan clones. DK is by far the most technically challenged in terms of connectivity and load time. I would play 1 game of each clone at lunch and dinner, and half the time, DK would disconnect in a raid (instant lost). In comparison, other good clones would disconnect once every half a year, while lesser clones would show a reconnect screen for 5 sec and resume. Couple with THE longest load time, it is clear DK is built for desktop, not mobile.",2
Awful good!!! Mleh,5
Fun but tedious,4
The game keep kicking me out for no reason the when I reload it says I'm being attack and plus my storage keep going to 0 when it is full,1
"Loved the original DK, this has been a fun trip down memory lane.  EA has clearly taken the idea of CoC and reformatted DK to fit the mold, but it's fun to play.  Motorola RAZR M",4
"I loved the old Dungeon Keeper games, but this is NOT one of them. This is not free. I'd like a paid version with no in app purchases and bs.",1
"Aaron Walker for your infomation, dungeon keeper was actually made before COC thank you. this is just a remaster with micros. and i like this better then COC so yeah. get good at searching info before saying something idiot.",5
this game cost too much money and really can't do nothing in it,1
A classic game franchise abso-freaking-lutely RUINED by EA's greed. A sad sad excuse for a remake. Horrible gameplay that can only be played if 100s of real $$ are spent.  Pitiful. Shame on you EA.,1
"This game is fairly graphic heavy with plenty of eye candy, considering the platform. If you enjoy the dungeon keeper series and like the half and half strategy gameplay style, I'd say pick this up and see if you like it since it is free. There are elements that add and some that detract (see in-app purchases). Still, EA did this one right and created an enjoyable game. If you have enough patience and can wait out all the timers, you can bypass most of the in-app purchase requirements.",5
It's not the best because the minions dnt defend epssaily trolls,3
J,5
This game is so amazeing,5
Fnaf,5
Pretty good but not the original,3
Lots of fun.,5
Not investing time in this again.,1
"This needs more of the classic single player experience to make me love it.  I will be hoping for a new version that brings back the old antics that runs out so quickly in this version.  Imp slaps must be on more than one screen!  More single player!  *edit* After only a couple weeks the only thing left to do is collect gold and stone, and tell imps to dig at 24hr dirt.  You can level through ladders without ever making a serious effort or initiating a fight.  Good bye DK. RIP",1
Great fun,5
loVE THIS GAME it lags but its awsome!,4
"They have to eat too, and this game is fantastic.",5
"Not quite like dungeon keeper 1 and 2 from the 90's, but one of the more fun free pay games out there.",4
I love this game from the started..its a great game,5
"Cool game, although a little slow loading, still fun to play. Has room for many improvements.",4
"Not what I had in mind! You completely destroyed dungeon keeper with this crap, I literally have to wait hours to do anything after I run out of green gems . I will be uninstalling this game.",1
It's. A little gilitchy but still.fun to play,5
The old dungeon keeper rocked. Still play them today. This is a little weird.,4
Greatest thing ever,5
Not going to give you my money. Sell me a game and I buy it. Try to trick me into lubricating that game with money and I'm not going to play.,1
I loved the original windows dungeon keeper from the 90s...wish this was a bit more similar...but definitely addicted to this version. Fun game!,5
Just like Clash of Clans. PvP tower defence game. Addictive (yes that's a good thing),5
Stellar,5
"Good game, an inverted clash of clans...",4
Really. Fun,5
"Prompts for a dungeon name after a brief tutorial. The game appears to be incompatible with my (default) Lollipop keyboard, so I cannot enter a name and continue playing beyond the tutorial.",1
Basically don't expect anything like the old dungeon keeper just expect a Clash of Clans type game,4
"It is a good game, not like the orginal, but it will do. 4 stars because the wait to upgrade/mine/build is just too long.",4
It's the best game ever!!!,5
Thank you ea for taking a loved game and crapping all over it. Hope someone will make a clone like the origional.,1
"This game is really fun but won't load, I had thus on my old phone and I got a new phone and it won't load. Plz fix this",3
Blatant money grabber riding the coattails of a treasured franchise .  Shame on the developer.,1
If you're not stupid it's free to play,5
It has all the annoying pay features you'd expext...get to a certain point and it is hard to progress without gems...but I still dig it.  Lots of fun.,5
An inventive clash of clans like variant. I love the flavor and the pathways.,5
"It's definitely a fun and unique game,  however it takes a long time it's one of those games that you better plan to play for a long time as you can really only play for maybe 10minutes a day without spending a fortune buying gems to speed stuff up. But if your ok with a game you can play a little each day as I am, then it's great.",4
Awesome,5
Couldn't keep away from the original and the buy-more-play-better version is the same.,5
Great game absolutely great just wish you could pick up everything and place it like in clash of clans.,5
"Dungeon keeper is pretty good, and is not a clone to C.O.C did u even play the game people",4
One of the best games I have played,5
Utter trash,1
I think thats its just a really awesome game that everyone should play,5
Terrible. So many micro transactions. 24 hours to remove one piece of land.,1
Diabolical! Love it to bits!...and pieces!,5
"Anyone who rated this game more than 1 star, is a moron.",1
AI needs work. Blow a path straight to the heart and if there happens to be an intersection then they'll follow that path instead of going to the heart.,3
Worst game in my life,1
My buddy told me to check this game out.  I still love every second of it.  10/10 should download.,5
Installed game and couldn't complete tutorial due to a keyboard bug. Htc m8. The bit I could play was afflicted by spending gems for EVERYTHING! On top of that ea is making it more difficult to rate this game poorly.,1
"I loved this game when I had it on PC, but it's become sheer crap when ported to mobile. There are a number of things that totally lower the enjoyment a lot: constant requests to like on Facebook and make reviews, items expensive and requiring hours to make, max. 2 imps unless you spent real money to buy more,  constant and annoying requests to make purchases, et al.  As the saying goes ""Free to play, pay to win"". Oh, also forgot to mention that this is a power hog. It'll suck the life out of your battery as I was left with 15% of my battery after playing the game off and on for only an hour and a half.  Don't recommend as there is no way to get more Imps BUT to make a purchase. Luckily, I still have and installed onto my laptop Dungeon Keeper 2 and all packs/patches. Gets totally worse, though. Made an In-Game purchase of 1100 Gems (had 66+ left) and after purchasing my next Imp for 800 Gems (game didn't give me a free one until after I restarted it), I had a grand total of 106 Gems remaining. For anyone interested, do the math. I got ripped off.",1
Maybe I am missing the small bad hiccups but smooth game play and consistency from the get-,3
Ea does it again taking a great franchise and bending it over. This game is terrible please do not download unless you lime paying $100 to win. Wtf where they thinking with pay dungeon,1
I just downloaded it and I cant even use it.,2
Ok,4
I don't care if it isn't the exact game mainly because it's a mobile game and I love it mostly for remembering the great things from the real game.,5
Unable to connect/Crashing alot lately,2
"Started playing when it was released on Dec 19, 2013. Today is feb 10, 2015. This game is very bad, and the game download low count on google play reflect my conclusion. Good bye.",1
"Meh, ok I guess",3
I think it could be better.,4
Nothing but micro transactions,1
This has got to be the best real time mobile game ever love the fact that it's on the dark side of things because being good gets boring,5
"Great game, easy to play, keeps you engaged! I'd recommend this game to anybody!",5
A lot of fun.,5
Great game! Keeps dropping out and losing server connection on 4g. Will upgrade review if connection problems are addressed.,3
WE NEED MORE PLAYERS!,5
"Brings back the memories of the old DK under a freemium wrapper.  Not bad at all compared with Clash of Clans, etc.  However, it needs more high end / top level upgrades, and getting the competition only currency, loadstone, is a bit of a pain.  Tournament idea is much better than a clan war.  From a long time freemium player who has never spent dime one in R.W. currency, this is a fun game and on the same level.  Ignore the negative press and give it a whirl!  I think you'll love it!  Oh, and I only occasionally have had connect issues, so they seem to be improving from what I've read in earlier reviews.",4
It is literally only for EA to ask for your money nonstop. and it is horrible,1
So far plays like the computer version I am so used to and love so much,5
It is amazing and for u morons who tjink it is like clash of clans this was befor clash so clash ripped off them not the other way around,5
Not like the original pc game but it is quite close,5
They need to fix the new glitches that prevent you from connecting to the server.,1
"I love this game. LOVE it... I could easily see it deposing Clash of Clans. Unfortunately, the game has serious issues. It boots me out of raids and campaign scenarios and survival raids ALL THE TIME. Often I can get started, but in the middle or near the end, I get booted back to my dungeon, causing me yo lose. Sometimes it won't even let me get that far, which at least doesn't count as a loss. If not for these issues I would probably be spending money on this game... Something I cannot say of other games.",1
Aswm,5
Best app ever,5
Ever since Android 4.4.4 the game won't run for more than a few seconds at a time.,2
At least in the start,4
"But now it is crashing constantly, and won't let me play at all.",1
"How ever after a patch early in March the game became UNplayable on my Android,  server stability became an issue. Crashing every time I attacked or defended my dungeon.  Once ea screwed a Guild member my entire guild opted out of continuing to reward EA with our patronage.  1* for server stability 0* for ea's usual crap customer service & 4* for game play when it functioned.  As of2/7/15 server can't even be connected to",2
"No strategy, no end game...blah",1
Decrease the wait time by a lot and I'll give u a better rating,2
"I am not happy about all the in game purchases, or the length of time it takes to build everything. The game play is entertaining as is the animation and Horney's comments.",4
Lots of fun,5
"I grew up on Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, it's so great to have a game I can actually play on my phone anywhere!",5
You have to pay to win. Clean it up EA,1
I like it but it really didn't catch my attention but still pretty good after it caught my attention,4
"The PC version was great, this pay to win version is OK a best, it has potential to do better.",3
Great version of thr classic PC game but as most games lately you have to pay to get things going or be very patient. I would give it 5 stars if thr costs were lower. You should never even have to think about spending 100 dollars ans still not have access to every aspect of a game. The best console games don't even cost that. Just saying.,4
"TOO long to upgrade, but fun",4
Great game.,4
EA doesn't care about the games they make anymore.,1
Best dungeon game ever,5
"Great game,  good but slow w/original Samsung note,  fast w/Samsung note 4",5
"The thing about this game is that its made by EA which I'm not a big fan of, other wise the game is perfect",5
Cool,5
Server connection drops sometimes. Great game!,4
Unplayable late game,1
Bigger players just keep attacking smaller ones relentlessly. This game needs balance so 1500 can't attack anyone below 1000.,1
Server disconnects have gotten to the point that you can't even raid. It is totally unplayable now. What was once a nice distraction is now an exercise in frustration. Don't bother it is dead on arrival.,1
"Unlike some others here, i dont mind the microtransactions. They arent required, they just make things faster and, also unlike others, i am a patient man.",5
My game always says can't connect but every other game I have works fine wtf,2
Been playing on my pc now its on my mobile excellent.,5
The win/loss reporting is always off by 5%. During the battle if you finish between 50 to 55 they drop you below 50 to make you lose out on rewards.,2
"Great game. Only thing is that it disconnects often, despite good WiFi connection, which makes it almost impossible to play. It especially sucks when you are in the middle of a raid and it suddenly quits, making you lose. Will change to 5 stars as soon as connection problems are solved.",1
"Addicting!!!! Like crack rock or meth addicting(I'm assuming, never tried either)!!!!!",5
Well balanced and decent updates with challenging play,5
Every time I open it it A: won't load B: uninstalls my wallpaper and locks me out of my phone,1
I played the (annoying) tutorial and still had no idea of what to do. :(,1
"Game is fun as long as there aren't any connection issues, which majority of the time it has problems. Can't keep my win streaks cuz in the middle of attacking..whoops.. DISCONNECTED now not only are you frustrated for LOSING ALL THE LOOT FROM THE BATTLE but you gotta REMAKE ALL THE GUYS you used before the server disconnect and to top things off YOU LOSE YOUR WIN STREAK!! So don't be expecting that extra bonus loot if your actually able to make your next attack w/ out their game continuously disconnecting.",1
"Terrible,  takes anything good with the original and puts it behind a wall of time or money, your choice. It's better to never let this be on your phone.",1
"I don't like having to buy things, but it's a good strategy game designing your layout and traps.",4
The pc is is better,1
To many pay walls and time takes forever don't ever get definitely if you love the original Dungeon Keeper games.,1
"This game is a fun scheduled builder at first, but the times to do anything after the first few days are quite ridiculously large.  This is a true ""pay-to-play"" game in that to enjoy the game you need to pay for extra actions, and EA has priced them rather high (not 'micro' at all).  Having said that, I do recommend playing it for a couple afternoons.",3
"I own both the PC DK games and have had them since they first came out. Despite all the criticism of this version I decided to load it. Unfortunately it seems the keyboard on my phone is not compatible so I cannot get past the prompt to name my dungeon. Oh well, uninstalled. This is on a stock Moto X (2nd gen.)",2
Excellent game.,5
This is far from being dungeon keeper,1
It seems like a game that some might like and that's  cool just not me.,1
Just plain fun.,5
Very fun just takes a long time to upgrade dungeon  heart and really costly to get 3rd imp. Otherwise  a lot of fun,4
This is not dungeon keeper.,1
"Used to be an awesome game, too many bugs, crashes and disconnects now, almost unplayable. Been playing since launch and really disappointed with the current state of play.",1
Really well done absolutely made for the phone and is extremely well mate,5
Pretty basic thing.,1
Played it awile back dead ended but now it's a great game,5
"Terrible scrubs trying to trick people into 5 stars, here is 1 star noobs...",1
"When it came time to name the dungeon, the game would just freeze up. EVERY TIME.",1
GREAT REMAKE OF A GREAT GAME,5
This game has kept my interest for over a year now.,4
If you like raiding and stealing s*** this is your game,5
"Little too ""spend money"" to be honest.. otherwise fun, just wish that they weren't so money hungry",3
Thanks for killing a childhood franchise EA.,1
Having only just started I can say that the game is fun and has a good sense of humor. The only problem I have  met is when I try to raid it seems like I'm battling dungeons that are three levels higher than me,4
"Wtf. Spent twice as long pressing the retry button waiting for the game to continue as I did aactuall playing the game. Standing right next to my router, not a weak connection.",1
Love the game so far,4
This is ridiculous,1
"This is the worst money grab I have ever seen. The game is basically unplayable unless you spend tons of money. I understand that your goal is to make money, but the fact that you need an option for $99 is just flat out greed.",1
This game sucks my battery dry even when i have it plugged in. Fun game though.,3
I downloaded this game after doing some research on it and watching some people play it. This game is obamanation of the original and you cannot play it without paying.,1
Excellent game,5
And it's not cheap,1
I just downloaded this game and I love it by the beginning,5
Totaly awesom,5
but this game is very addictive but now not so good 2 much is expensive,2
This game is awesome,5
"Bomb spell is way too overpowered, what's the point of making a dungeon if everyone can spam 20 bombs all around and make swiss cheese out of your dungeon? Loading time has also become terrible.",1
I just like the raids and dungeons and other stuff  so I give this game 5 stars.,5
Old school awesome,5
I have missed this game.,5
"I love it so much, that I don't sleepüò¥üò∞üò©üòÅ       GO KEEPERS",5
Makes you feel like a king or queen,5
"Played this game up until 90% of the ""content"" (dungeon heart at second to last level).  This game is only loosely based on the fantastic Dungeon Keeper franchise from Bullfrog.  The game has fun moments, an okay diversity of rooms, options, creatures, tactics, spells.  But the game isn't a DK game, it just tries to slap a DK skin to what is actually clash of clans.  The chicken jokes get really heavy handed often.  And the more the game progresses, the laggier, and more unstable and buggy it got.",2
I LOVE  IT,5
Great fun ... time waster... hilarious prices,5
"I would give it a 5 stats if it wasn't because I have to buy gems and such, I do get that you need some way to gain profit with this, but it just kills the game, if we are going to raid others dungeon, should be fair play not money play",4
"My screen starts freaking out in the middle of a challenge... My brother recommended this game because he knows one of you developers and thought it would have it's glitches taken care of quickly... It was the necromancer challenge, I'm using a Samsung galaxy light and I have screenshots of the error if you need... it looked like a massive hole in the code but I don't know anything.... please fix cause I cannot progress until you do....",1
I like it and all but y dose every cost so much like lower the prices for everything not much but make it affordable,3
"So lately there have been some issues with downloading new updates onto a Google phone, the nexus 5. Further issues with being logged out constantly on the newest DK update.DK just ain't what it used to be I guess.",3
Yaaaa,4
"A super DK fan, love the mix of a mobile game feel and DK feel. Think the issue people are having is that they are wanting DK3, this is not. Its DK Mobile.",5
Great version of the old classic dungeon keeper.  Of course modified slightly for modern game technology but holds onto the feel of the original very well.,5
Its like overlord but on my phone,5
Wicked,4
fun,5
great app its really fun,5
Fun and funny.,1
"I really liked the original Dungeon Keeper, so this was pretty fun as well, I just wish it was more like the original game, and not another freemium game...",3
Great game. I do like the originals better.,5
I love this game haven't played In awhile so I thought I'd redowbload it.,4
"I am enjoying this game so much. I actually supposed that I am. I am not one for the games that you do somethings and then walk away from the game, but this one is so addicting. At my level I'm waiting a couple of days building thing or upgrading so the wait is getting longer. My only complaint is really the wait, but if you can wait then this is your game.",5
Clash of dungeons,1
Fun,5
"This game looks great, but I can only play to the point where I need to name my dungeon. The onscreen keyboard comes up, and I'm unable to type - no way to progress. Tried on two different Nexus 4 smart phones, 4.4.4 and 5.0.1.",1
It is repeatedly loading the game fix it,2
Great game very similar to original pc version. ..lots of fun...on a galaxy s3 no problem running it,5
Deleted right after my phone yelled at me in the middle of the night for not having enough storage for my stone :-P,1
I used to love this game but now its just a clash of clans remake. Bring back the old version!!,2
I haven't been able to log in in like 4 days error code 15. I'm really sad I love this app :c,1
"The game is fun and graphics are Great, but the game does not work for long on mobile device. I have a 16GB Samsung S2 and the I cannot run the game on it past the guard tower with an Immortal. There are a number of issues with the in-game play as well. 1) There is no way to interact with the other players unless u r on facebook or in their league, 2) there r a lot of bugs when building fill dirt walls and clicking on rooms and other items, 3) the game drains batteries fast cuz of the graphics in forefront.",2
"Fun a great time killer. Funny,funny.",5
"It takes months of 2-3 times a day game play to get anything done.  Unless you are willing to give them a lot of money.  Since it is taking longer and longer to load. Has been crashing frequently, typically right after I start a raid,  causing me to loose my warriors. I'm just done.",3
"Poor. It is better once u play a few days still slow but addictive starting to change opinion maybe ***+  The app still has connect took issues it goes through checking for updates, connecting to server, unable to connect to to server, try again, connecting and zits there fofever. After 8 or 9 tries I am sometimes able to get on.  All of my other internet apps work fine.  please fix this.",3
I am a huge DK fan.  I played the original PC versions a ton.  Your mobile game itself gets 4 stars... How you monetized it gets a 1 star.  If you had just let me buy it for X dollars I would have spent the money on it.  As it sits now I won't spend a penny on it and as it works now i am thinking i wont play it as I am very frustrated that I can't really do much aside from queue up 2 things to be built and then log out for 5-8hrs while it builds.... Ridiculous.   I laughed when I saw you had marked $100 dollar bundle of ‚Äôgems‚Äô was the best value.  This game is not worth $100... Or $50... Or $25... I would pay $5.99 for the full game though.  Maybe even slightly more assuming I got the FULL game.  But as it currently is you will get $0.  Please change your monetization.  I want the full game.  I do not want to have to pay every time I want to play it over and over and over.,1
Thought I'd be fighting the good guys,4
"Gems seem to come easy and free, and ol' Horny makes for an excellent companion.",5
"Why are these people allowed to right out lie and not be charged with false advertising? Where is the better buisness bureau? And PLAYSTORE should be extremely ashamed for not only allowing but even promoting this nonesense all for the measly peanuts they make from these scams. P.S. Is full of these scams ""apps"". Shame on you.",1
Yeh,5
This games cool really it I to the is,5
A lil different but it works out fine,5
"I wish there was a ""storage tray"" you could put rooms and traps into while remodeling your dungeon. Like in Clash of Clans",1
"The game is fun, but is full of bugs which prevent it from being really enjoyable and make it frustrating at times.  For example, you attack another player and defeat him with a 51% victory, the game will still say you only dealt 45% damage and count it as a loss. (Almost as if the last 30 seconds of the battle don't count) Also, when you deploy minions in combat, 3-5 of them to freeze along the way and can be seen aimlessly hacking away at walls until they are killed.",2
"ITS OVER 9000!!!!!! [o.O},|/,,",5
"Typical EA dumkopfs mess up a great opportunity for a good game. Loved the original, but this is micro transaction hell.",2
I don't know what to say its just fun and when your boerd you can beat the living crap out of your workers!,5
"If you're a fan of the old games, check out War For The Overworld. It's a fan-made game that DK veteran Peter Molyneux has praised. I bought it on Steam and it's awesome. This game here is crap.",1
"I loved the original, and at first I wasn't super happy about the free to play model. However, as these games go, this is really one of the better ones.",5
It's alright.,4
It reminded me of the old game they change it a lot lot time I played it,4
I really like this game and it doesn't crash,5
"I'm not happy about the constant crashes and disconnect issues. Even with strong wifi, you get kicked off the servers before you can really get into the game content. EA's engineers totally screwed the pooch this last update, I had rated 4 stars, now they get two. Weekly guild tournaments,  and elite tournaments that only the Chinese and Russians can win, it has just become another clash of clans clone....1 star because 0 isn't an option.",1
Awesome,4
"ITS REALLY LIKE ""THE QUEST FOR EPIC LOOT""I LOVE IT",5
"I just bought the $10 bundle of gems but didn't get my free imp :( I bought one anyways but if you could hook up the freebie so Id have 4 that would be awesome!! Thanks in advance, love the game!",4
"The game won't even load, connect to a server, or even play. It freezes up on the main load screen over and over and is just unbearable. Also what is up with the cartoon like graphics!? I mean come on this is a game about leading your hellish army to conquer the overworld not making it visually appealing to kids... Why have you tarnished DK's name!?",1
"Ive been upgrading for a year and a half, spent alot on the game too, but I estimate I wont be done uograding for two more years.",5
Fun game overall,5
Truely one of the top 5 games ive downloaded. I highly recommend it dont let other reviews about other player complaining stop you from trying it.,5
I loved dungeon keeper. I hate this version. Its nothing like the original and seems to be made with too many middle men and not enough game play. Why is it so hard to just give us the original style? I'd even pay for it if I had to. Its better than this crap.,1
Sucks all I can say,1
I like the game it is very addictig but there are little things like not having to summon demons again after using them in a raid even if they dont die that could make it better.,4
Please find a way to fix the code 7 problem,3
Dungeon keepee for PC was amazing in back in the day and this is all about how much money you put in the game.,1
"An amusing game, but it crashes frequently.  It is playable without the pay content but the high barriers to gem acquisition make it frustrating to do the free play.",3
Slap a pretty title on a micro transaction game you have EA,1
Fun game. Gets you thinking.,5
Its a great alternative to those other strategy games. Different. I like it,4
This game,5
Awesome Game,4
A good blend of the snark from the old game with how most free but pay games are run now. Worth the time (and money) investment if you were a fan of the classic pc version.,5
This game is pay to win. do not play this game and don't give them your money,1
Not perfect but a fun strategy game.  I like the way each attack teaches you more tricks.,4
Was a great game but constantly crashes. Please fix!!,2
"Great, entertaining game.",5
My keypad won't come up when I try to type my dungeon name,5
Game boreing.  Lose money faster than you can mine it. Lose over 8ook in day and gain back 300k if lucky. EA needs to do math.,1
Wonderful,5
Fun game.,5
Great Game! It has alot of humour. Great graphics. stop wasting Precious time and Download it!,5
Fun game,5
Its defanately not the original .....,3
I love this game.,5
I like it  its cool how you can play the bad guy,5
EA is f*%king cash cow have to pay to win.,1
This game is horrendous with it paywalls I mean for f**** sake why does it take 24 hours just to mind those gray rocks with gemes in them I mean are you s******* me why the f*** do I need to wait for a day just to mind something,1
Game is good,5
Great game,5
If you get over the fact that you can pay to become more powerful then its fun.  Just play for free!!,4
Greatgoryone says great game.,5
"Does not allow me to name the dungeon, the keyboard continues disappearing. Seems like it would be a decent game otherwise",2
Different than the original fun to play. Only problem is our group guild leader hasn't been back in 3 months so we're kinda screwed. And when it disconnects. And sometimes I win a raid but it glitches and then it says I lost. Boo.,3
It is wonderful I like this a lot,5
I like it but could be much better,4
"This is a game with the same business model as games like Clash of Clans. It's free to play with the option to speed up by buying gems. The game gives you ample opportunity to earn enough gems to raid other dungeons frequently. If you don't want to wait for your buildings to upgrade or if you want more imps to build more buildings at once, you've got to pay. That's just how this mobile game platform works these days. If you don't like it, play the PC version.",5
Love it!!,5
"Need to watch my ram memory or it crashs,  servers drop alot, but the game is excellent,  I will add that I have lvled up without purchases, it can be done. This is not the original dk or dk2, its dk3 and I wish people would stop complaining.  Cant wait for the next dk4 which I hear is ""different"" again.  They are all great games keep them coming EA.",5
F*** THIS GAME,1
I bought my jems where is my worker?,2
Its good but that needs to be fixed,1
"The game was so amazing, but once you get higher up, it just becomes frantic and tedious to do anything. The challenges become to hard and require a lot more thinking than they should. And on top of that, there is not enough balance I'm the game",2
"I gave it a shot, but I just couldn't find anything to like. Incredibly stiff and restrictive play unless you were willing to pay. Profoundly minimal actual game play.",1
A throwback to the pc version.  I like :),4
"It's not even so, this is just a blatant cash-in from EA, don't download the app, EA will suck up and rape your wallets!",1
It looks like DK but is fairly far from the original game.,3
When it came to name my dungeon the keyboard didn't work! So I'm stuck and can not play anymore.,1
Should have kept it like the pc version. . I see I will have the same issue here as I did with castle clash/clash of clans.  After making it so far it will become almost impossible to advance without having to spend money.,3
I love it,5
Fun to waste time,5
Needs cash to make any progress hides negative reviews EA is toxic,1
Epicly AWESOME!,5
Noting like the old dungeon keepers long waiting time just to mine one (1 day) if you get this it will make you cry,1
"Imp had on an android outfit, click on imps, says free imp, spends all my gems completing some room instead. Seems legit.",2
Love this game,5
"The have play is fun. Sure, it's not the old dungeon keeper, but in itself a good game. The biggest issue with the game is it constantly disconnects and crashes, regardless of signal quality. The other problem is you can buy your way to high ranks, not good.",2
This game is NOT Dungeon Keeper!!! FIX THIS EA!!!!,2
"I loved dungeon keeper! This is not what I loved. Please give us the old game back. No micro transaction, no free to play! When all it took was skill and patience to play. Not how big your wallet is.",2
"They keep updating and upgrading this game without fixing the main game-breaking issues. I have contacted their tech support many times to no avail. They need to allow the game to function according to data that has already been downloaded to your phone without relying on a constant, impossibly strong Internet connection for everything. You know, like other games do. And if the game does have to crash in the middle of a long raid, let us resume the raid after the delay. Or at least let us try again for free",1
Fun game  great way to pass the time,4
All about your money,1
This game is very addictive....I can't stop playing....no problems so far,5
Fun,5
"Fun, for a wile, don't bother if you are looking for an experience like the old pc version of DK.",3
Not a bad game but very slow.  It takes hours to build things.  Once you builders are done you can get a bit more playing time in attacking other players to get materials for next building then its back to waiting and waitingand waiting.,3
This game is really fun and competitive.,5
Horny? Purchases? I do like the little ads though.,2
Its not letting me uninstall it cause I want to install it again,3
"First thing it tries to do is charge me five bucks for a ""free"" imp. Classy.",1
Do a bunch of stuff so some d-bag can attack you while you're of line. POS money hole.,1
"Every time I try to name my dungeon during the tutorial, the keyboard comes up, I tap a letter and instead of adding a letter, it just makes the keyboard go back down. Tried it over and over and over and over, still nothing.",1
Well constructed and fun without feeling like you need to buy your way to a win,5
The old dungeon keepers were very tedious but still slightly fun. This one isn't actually fun in the non-building/upgradeing gameplay. But the building and upgrading was neat (mostly due to the visuals).,2
Nice variation on 'farm' games.   No thought required.,3
Just yay,5
Plenty of events to keep us busy.,4
I still love the game but it'd love it even more if i stops crashing me during log ins or in raids and making me lose almost automatically! This obviously isn't a probably only i have.,4
"No suport, money grab remake of DK! Constant crashes,bad play,dont waist you money or time",1
Much better than clash of clans. Highly recommended,5
It,5
Accidentally spent gems killing week of progress. Gems most useful in-game currency and take longest to accrue w/o real $$ purchase. Made an otherwise fun game very frustrating.,3
HELL of a good game,5
"I loved the old DK games, and this is a welcome port to the mobile world. Though it requires patience to play without dropping some hard earned coin, it's playable. Just take minor breaks when your imps are tied up building and upgrading things. Thanks EA!",5
Aawesome,5
"So yes its a freemium game but im going to tell you guys an age old secret to winning at freemium games are you ready? Persistence is how you win. I have 4 goblins and a hero that cost gems to buy, but i havent spent a dime on this game. Everything is unlockable if you keep playing",4
But still fun,4
I LOVE THIS GAME XD,5
Great game. Wish it was more like the pc version but I'm still drawn to this game for some reason.. &gt;. &lt;,4
I would pay 20 $ for a continuation of the original DK series this is a DK skinned pay to win/not wait game. But still ok so far.,3
I don't enjoy attacking at all so I only defend and its been months since I've been able to upgrade my dungeon heart after the update that uses points to upgrade it instead of resources. I would appreciate the switch back so i can enjoy the game again.,4
Only thing that sucks is that it costs to much for minions why can't u guys lower the gem price it's hard enough to get gems as it is it really blows add a spin the wheel for gems as a daily incentive or get gems for daily log in,2
Reminds me of dark lord,5
It is a micro transaction trap but could be fun if they fixed that,2
Yep it's expensive.  I don't put cash into any Game and I'm in the top 3 percent.  Just be patient and if you're disconnected often I'd recommend playing only on a high end device. It's pretty demanding and I noticed I'd disconnect if my wifi signal was weak. Maybe raiding over lte is better?,5
"It's honestly not that much fun anymore,  pretty bored with it.",3
Horrible trophy system. Horribly imbalanced combat system.,1
Fun game.  I recommend giving it a try if you like coc style games.,5
"It lacks a campaign, or really any gameplay for that matter.",1
This game is sooo amazing...its different from clash of clans...I love the way the format is set up,5
"Even ignoring the other games in the series and taking this one just on its own, this is a wretched excuse of a game.  Nothing more than a soulless shell whose sole purpose is testing your patience until you break and buy your way to victory at a cost of anything up to $100 a pop.  EA should be ashamed of themselves.",1
"Some new features..Though it seems they are intended to extend the length of time spent to build key items. Case in point, the dungeon heart.",3
Absolutely sucks in this iteration.,1
"I really want to play Dungeon Keeper (or, rather, the original Dungeon Keeper), and this thing is so close!  but, instead it's chock full of boredom and wasted time.",1
I really like the game but it's now the only game not loading on my phone and it says that I've been attacked but the minions are fixing something for hours now.,4
"Great job devs, but maybe you should make imps cost a lot less. Or give us more money and gems. This game will cost a person a ton of money to make much progress. Still I love this game. Maybe you should also release an android version of the actual original Dungeon Keeper games. I really loved them! Great job anyway!",5
Bob,5
I get booted within the first two minutes of starting. I manage to get up to the point of getting the imp to dig and then I get booted to reconnect.,2
I think you should be able to have features from the actual gake,5
Has everything from the original DK's from the past with a fun new spin.,5
Really fun good game,5
Those updates did wonders,5
I loved the original pc games so I decided to give this a try. I have to say I am disappointed. I don't want to have to go on constant raids and wait for hours or more to upgrade unless I pay real money. This isn't supposed to be farmville!,2
"I never played the original dungeon keeper, So this is all based on this game. This game is really fun. Besides the microtransactions it somewhat forces you to do, the gameplay itself is great. But today I log in to find out that my dungeon was gone and I had to restart. But I'm not. I'm done with this game. The disconnecting from servers is one thing but restarting, Yeah I'm good.        TL;DR game is fun but long load times and ea crave for money.",3
"Do not IAP very often but this game deserves it, I bought the original for PC too. 5* if connectivity yes improved.",4
Cool,5
Blatant money grab. Fun enough if you're willing to spend but servers are buggy to say the least even then. Don't waste your time.,1
But still fun,4
You get to where you name your dungeon and it doesn't acknowledge the keyboard.,2
For some reason I cant stop playing it..,5
"I am still trying to get used to it, but seems pretty good. not sure if I like the whole pay for upgrades though. I prefer to buy a game to play it with everything already there. later if there is an expansion pack, then I would have the option of buying it if I wanted.",4
But do get disconnected alot,3
Updates are cool you attack other  players it's more then you think  install  it! üòÇüòÇüî´üòàüòÉüòâüòÅüíØüöò,5
This game is crap now.,1
"Love it but trolls could cost less gems though,",4
Awsome and adicting,5
Fun game. Neat monsters.,4
The best in my book,5
Ask parents before downloading!!!,1
He who pays the most wins. Those who have spent the most stay on top. You will eventually hit a stopping point with no way to progress further. You can seriously spend hundreds $$$$ or more ouch! !,1
"After learning about this game I bought the original version to try it out. Although the original version has horrible graphics, it is a lot of fun. However this adaptation is not so fun. I've given this game a few months to play and it's just not living up to its name. At this point I only play the game for a few moments once a day to gather the resources. Since everything is so expensive, I can't actually play the game except about once a week. This game is best described in one word, disappointment.",2
"This is an great game. But right after I spent $15 dollars on this game...it started crashing and keeps saying ""please wait while your imps get your dungeon in order"". I've restarted my phone 2 times and it keeps doing it. Please fix this bug or whatever it is. I'm pretty sure this is happening to other people as well. Please fix or you're guaranteed to lose gamers and I will give 5 stars when it's fixed!!!!!! PLEASE FIX!",3
Very much fun,4
"I've been looking for a game like this one forever. Awesome gameplay, and it's great that the game isn't very big. Only issue is long load time. But its acceptable cuz the game rocks",5
"Needs 1 2,3,,& 4x replays",4
Definitely a good game so far.. has the clash type theme but somehow u made it different and really interesting.. awesome job guys,5
People that are complaining are stupid and have slow phones,4
You were able to pull 20 dollars from my pocket thanks to nostalgia from a game franchise that i loved back in the day.,5
This game sucks it is filled with micro transactions that stop the game play so you will spend more money this game is a disgrace to the dungeon keeper name just go buy the original it is so much better and they don't have micro transactions.,1
Good game to bad want  money for imps,4
Look! EA ruined another game series we all love! That's not new.,1
Funny and unique but completely controlled as a freemium microtransitions galore,1
Addictive,5
Absolutely addictive,5
It is the like all the original games with a few extra perks. :-),5
Played the PC version back when it was new. Play smart and the game is still free people. It is after all a strategy game :) No problems with gameplay after 20+ hours.,5
i waited until christmas to rate this to see how they were at christmas.  no gems no nothing.  1 star.  jerks,1
"I've been kicked out of too many raids and had too many problems loading this game to give it a higher rating than mediocre.  Game play is great when it works, but I've had significant problems connecting and maintaining connections no matter how strong my connection strength is.",3
Great game play great humour big diversity simple yet complex,5
I play the first Dungeon Keeper still today on my PC. Very fun game. Saw this and it is your usual army building game but they kept all of the old game feel. Very nice. Well done.,5
,5
Love It,5
Love the computer game and love this one,5
Yea,5
"A mobile version of dk, as expected",5
Question please anwser. I understand the concept u want to make money off this game weather it be buy charging to download it or through in game currencies.  Okay instead of using a  title of an amazing game that was on pic and simply gutting the game to garbage why not simply release the exact same game. Exact let's say it once more exact same game identical and simply add I g the currency or charging for the game. I know I'm simply a number in life don't ruin great games for penny's on a dollar.,3
"It' micro transaction galore and a disgrace to the original game. ""Kudos EA"" I THINK NOT! And to you EA, there is no amount of money you can pay me, I will never give any bad game any good ratings no matter how much money you give me. I don't care if this is flaming.",1
I really like this game,4
enjoyable and entertaining.  I rather like the game that flows at my pace.  The in game purchases are reasonable and the game is quite playable without using any.  I also rather enjoy the way the game runs in terms of other players,5
"Fun game, hoped it would be like to he PC versions, but then again, it's freemium.  Good graphics, and plenty of things to keep it interesting.",4
Pay options are poor either spend a ton or none. I would guess 99% free play only. It really needs more community. If you would never spend any money this is a good choice for a game.,4
Always nice to be the bad guys,5
The game won't even let me name my dungeon,2
A very fun strategic game,5
if you know what your doing. I really like It. I'm having a lot of fun on this game.,5
"I grew up with Dungeon Keeper.  DK is just another clash of clans remake.  Where`s the old spells and hatcheries.  Why can't you summon up as many imps as you want?  Where's the old you get what you get from the portal?  I liked seeing some of the old things and got a lot of nostalgia, but this is just a spin off I could care less to play.  Add the features of the old game with a new campaign, same style of art, don't make it kid friendly. Add challenges and a battle between two starting with nothing. Blood",2
Defending your keep against giant clucking chickens is kinda weird but give it a shot! It's my longest playing game on the tablet.,5
"Has issues connecting to the server every so often, but the game itself is great! Thank you EA.",4
Unplayable. Save a while for upgrade.. Get looted for everything you have.. Repeat.. Or spend 10 bucks for that single upgrade.. No thanks!,1
Excelent,5
Awesome better than dungeon overlord!!!!,5
It's halfway decent,3
So far so good,4
Love the new update attacking is more different and the bolstering makes things more interesting well earned 5 stars but when making a new layout it crashes please fix,5
Won't even let me finish the tutorial,1
I cant get past naming the dungeon. It freaks out and doesn't let me enter a name or submit. As soon as I try to enter a letter the keyboard disappears,2
"I am addicted, wow great game!",5
Glad the made a free version,5
"I like the game, but every update causes issues or changes the basic strategy of the game.  Also, at higher levels, everything is to slow.  A ploy to try and get you to spend money I'm sure, but by that point, why bother?",3
One glitch load times,5
A fun way to just waste time and destress,5
Since the last patch connecting and staying connected is really hard.  Also if you pay long enough you will be forced to pay.,1
Nothing like original dk. Just another lame android game,1
"Used to play this on the PC back in the day. Great adaptation, though I wish you could upgrade the imps. Great game!                                   Amended: this game WAS cool until it uploaded a spell that disables your traps for THE ENTIRETY OF THE RAID thus completely negating the months i spent building and upgrading them. Thanks idiots.",1
Word up G,5
Takes me back to dungeon keeper 1 and 2. But better online performance.,5
Won't let me enter dungeon name on my phone so I can't play it,1
It won't let me get past the tutorial because I can't name my dungeon,1
The graphics are a little cartoony compared to the PC games but it is a fine way to pass time.,4
"Easy to learn, fun and competitive",5
This game used to be fun til I couldn't connect,1
Game resets too many times. I hate to tell the imps this but my dungeon is already in order.,1
Awesome.,5
"The title is what you'll read every two attacks. Getting disconected is not a signal problem, it's entirely a game flaw. Constant interruptions all around make for a severly annoying game. Yet, fights are entertaining, the level of design is somewhat pleasing to the eye, the slow time to load anything is unnerving and that'll sum it up.",2
Love u can build ur own dunegennn,5
Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool,5
This games was really fun until recently when they started having serious disconnect issues.  It reloads 2-5 times every minute.,1
Great dungeon runner,5
....................................................no...just no......,1
"Game used to suck for many reasons, had to stop playing it even uninstalled for a but. Decided to pick up it and many of the reasons I didn't want to play were fixed. Bravo",5
Developer continues to nerf free based play and overpowers pay to play players.,1
Don't care lol I'll pay for some stuff stop hating,5
Not quite as fun as the original but it certainly brings back memories.,4
"I really enjoyed this game but it seems like the servers have connrction issues (loading screen), when ur in a raid u lose connection and automatically lose even if you were winning. Its been happening more as I am now a high level keeper to the point where this game is no longer playable and a waste of time it takes up a lot of space so I will uninstall. Too bad this little game was fun.",1
"COOL GAME, pretty evil.but for some reason I'm only gold 2 and every attack, on me or attacking, their dread or obsidion",5
Pretty cool. Metal as hell haha.,4
A good re-imagining of the classic computer game. The the game follows in the same over-the-top silly themes of it's predecessor.,4
"Constantly restarts during battles. Very frustrating.  Will uninstall if it doesn't get fixed.                                  .                                                                 .update 12/15... now constantly crashes. Trying to re-organize my dungeon and it crashes, and disconnects every couple of minutes. Im done. Uninstalling.",1
Its y favorite game they have something like this on some websites and you get to level things up to and its like monsters help defend your base from what ever you bild and you mine for your money in the walls' but yeah tottaly love this! I want some slime monsters and spiders.,5
Good interaction.,4
This game is a sad excuse and dosent even compare to the original dungeon keeper 1&2 it is like any other free to play game filled with micro transactions the game even tells you to use gems safe your money and if you want good game for a 8th of the price go buy the original it is ten times better and dosent make you spend money to do anything in the game this is what gaming is turning into do not pay for gems,1
Cool as hell.  I wish I could get my dungeon bigger but time will fix that I hope,5
Mu haha haha this is fun,5
Nicely done version. Some of the building times seem a little long though,5
"The price curve is kinda high like most mobile games nothing new here. The game it self is great though, plan to play it super casual as soon as it stops holding your hand.",5
"What a disappoint. Not even a shell of the original games. It's just Clash of Clans with DK characters. Ridiculous upgrade times, and basically requires you to buy gems if you want to play the game. Electronic Arts has come a long way from Plants vs Zombies, what an epic fail. I'm done with EA games, just a waste of time and money.",1
when i first played this game the connection was good but now the connection is bad,4
"A lot of fun so far.  That was my first reaction.  This has since stopped being fun.  Would be a better game if you could opt out of constantly being attacked by other players.  I know it sounds like I am whinging, but it really does suck out the enjoyment for me.  I will stick with the PC version from now on.",2
Its worse because it took the classic and put time of a day A BLOODY DAY!!! And 70‚Ç¨ for 14000 gems and its just 56 blocks buy the classic not phone,1
Topic. Only save your gems and let the timers go out while I  tutorial.,5
"Fun, good little game. Steep premium model.",4
I have the most fun playing this and so glad they brought do to android,5
It a really fun game,5
You can't play this game without in-app purchases or waiting for days to actually accomplish anything.  Found the original game online for $5.99.  No in-app purchases required :-).,1
Very addictive,5
Its ok,3
You can get by without spending much if you really try.,5
The original Dungeon Keeper was amazing! This app took whatever was fun about DK and crushed it! WAIT 1 DAY FOR A SINGLE WALL TO BE REMOVED! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH EA!!! May god have mercy on your souls!,1
Pay to win on another level,1
"Using Nexus 6, 5.0, the keyboard will not function for naming your dungeon.",1
So many things I love and hate about this game...,3
Fun but somewhat of a time consumer unless you are willing to spend cash,4
Fun on a bun son,5
"Once you start moving in the campaign more the Gems are impossible to get, unless you want to fork out a lot of money.  You will enjoy it for hr or so after that the game is useless. Can't even restart this game! Lame.",1
Game won't even let u complete tutorial uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times my favorite game series too bad it got bought by a company who doesn't care,1
I've always loved this franchise and wondered why there wasn't more games. Thanks :),5
This game rocks.... Would be better if you could keep surviving minions when done with battle,4
This app should have been awesome. Play old school dungeon keeper? Sign me up! Literally... Sign me up! Especially since I can't get through the dang tutorial because I can't enter in my dungeon name since my keyboard disappears every time I try to press any key! Also your tech support is a joke. Seriously I have to fax or mail you parental permission to use your forum support!? I'm sorry morons I don't live in the @#$%ing dark ages.... Tell you what allow me to play the game and I'll actually rate the game,1
"New event raids suck, and generally are a huge waste of time",2
Excellent,5
"It won't let me enter the dungeon name, every time I try to hit a key it just closes the key board",3
Never expected this game to play the way it does but it does and it's great,5
"It's not more of the same, there's always something new to do which changes the strategy you use to attack and defend.",5
Won't allow naming the dungeon to continue could be a good game,2
"Similar to clash of clans and jungle heat. I still play dk2 on the comp. The app relates to it in the way that it names things, but not in game play. I was hoping it would be like the scrimmages on dk2.",2
Love it! Still,5
This game is really fun and you should try it,5
No matter what I try I can't get passed the enter dungeon name screen... And no help from customer support.,1
I'm not having any connectivity issues except when I'm near a crappy connection or on a crappy device. It brings so many memories back. I love it. The premium currency is actually quite easy to get compared to other games. But I like this game so much I keep spending it to go faster. I like that play without the currency is still fun and exciting! Woocha! Very nice!,5
Love it,5
Love it,5
THE WORST GAME OF 2014,1
Love this game great fun and funny as well.,5
Thank you so much to EA for bringing this awesome game to Android,5
Awesome game been waiting for them to come out with this one I could spend hours playing this game,5
"The customizing of a dungeon and tactical raiding is great quick fun, but the disconnecting issues can make you more frustrated than satisfied.",4
I'd like to like this game but all it does is crash I would highly recommend not even putting it on your phone until you start to see reviews say that they fix the stupid thing.,2
But bugs you to buy buy buy at every move.,4
"I keep getting screwed over by the game crashing during my attacks, which resets my win streak, uses up my minions and mana, and gives me a loss. If the game crashes during an attack, the entire attack should be forgotten, and all used minions and mana refunded. Even if I'm winning when it crashes, the game still counts it as a loss.",1
Can't stop playing!,5
Updates take too long,3
"It drains the battery and makes the phone hot, and doesn't handle wifi connection drop. If you have a poor connection you can't raid without risking to loose right away if the connection drop",4
I loved the 2 original PC titles and have been loving the new Andriod version.  I am a DK addict!,5
Why get it?!,1
Enough with the time based freeware crap. You took a great franchise and turned it into crap. Shame on you EA.   Sell me a game for $5-10 and make it actually playable.,1
"The game freezes and skips around on the screen if you try moving the screen too much while something is going on at the same time. I liked the game on the computer, both of them, and I'm glad that EA brought DK back, and the layout isnt bad either, but this gameplay is horrible. Not only that issue but in any pvp attack, you can easily overtake an enemys Dungeon Heart. So many flawed offensive and defensive variables.. fix these two issues, and I will rate 5 stars and probably donate to this game as well.",1
"They took a great old game and ruined it. Everything take so long to do and you can get anywhere unless you spend real money. I'd rather a game that I can just buy once and play whenever, even if I don't have a WIFI connection",1
Ea,1
What a horrible idea to have people wait 5 days to be able to play again?? Upgrade waits are ridiculous!!!  This game is complete money hungry!!,1
CRASHED,2
"Start game get 2 loading screens, random disconnect while managing your dungeon or do an event raid or pretty much anything and you get to see another loading screen. Sweet!",1
"I loved the old games, but this one is garbage. Play clash of clans. This was fun until I wasted an hour of my life with the download and the start of the game. After doing the tasks set I was unable to name my dungeon or go any further in the game. What a piece of crap. Sad thing is I saw a lot of bad reviews, and tried anyway. It wasn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",1
With last updated they fixed discount and added lots of new stuff if you start over,4
Now I can enjoy a different version on my phone. This game is clash of clans to the t with some minor upgrades in my opinion to the layout of the game. I am just a dungeon keeper  can from back in the day so this brings back good memories for me.,5
Love this game,5
Reminds me of when I use to play on the pc. Great game,5
"Originally I hated it but since they made it more stable,  it's more like the original game I remember.",5
Love it,5
When it asks for you to name the dungeon it won't let you enter anything.,1
I waited long enough to try and give EA a better reveiw.... the game froze on my over ... mad i bought  anything in this game... wish i could get a refund... and your customer service is a automated responds that doesn't help!!!! If      you download this game don't buy anything.,1
Love it,5
Its terribleit keeps saying checking for updates fix it please,1
"The game won't let me enter dungeon name and I can't continue if I don't. Looked fun. Now deleted. If they fix the problem I'll play, but until then...",1
It feels like the old 1s,5
"Easy and fun, my kids like it alot",5
Ah nostalgia. A remake after my heart,4
Loved that they implemented the use of a tower defense game and a city game,5
Solid tower defense game. Pvp can be frustrating though.,5
I've been playing this game for months. Built my dungeon up & max out my minion capacities. Only to start a raid with my multiplier up. To have the game kick me out of raid. Losing my multiplier of stars & my minions during a tournament. When it means the most.  This game is a P.O.S.... DON'T WASTE YOR TIME DOWNLOADING IT.,1
Two in a row now...raids that during the raid I've won and then when it end says I've lost...that is total BS.,1
0 stars if possible. The game needs to have the same aspect of the old ones. It takes to long for stuff to finish so EA please stop.,1
"The game has become very frustrating to play.  Alot of server disconnects and crashes, makes what could be a 5 star game very frustrating to play.",2
I love the game but a chat room could be implemented. I think all games should at least have one....nevertheless awesome game!,5
I love it butt it is a copies of clash,5
Game good,4
Love it,5
My favorite strategy game. Much more strategy involved than coc. RECOMMENDED. The new updates a huge improvement. Resources are soooo abundant. :P And tiny is fixed,5
Awesome game,5
"Love the game.  Recent update has made it impossible for me to slap imps, game crashes when I try",4
"So I had this for iPad, and it was fun and all but some of the blocks took 24 hours to get rid of and I only had 2 imps. Got bored and got rid of it. Then I see it's been updated quite a lot so I get it on Android, and it took a little bit to download, then I had to get the update, which doubled the memory usage, so I play through the tutorial, which had loading screens that took a couple minutes to get past, then it came down to naming my dungeon. Couldn't name dungeon. Save yourself time and don't get it.",1
good game,5
Both my phone and tablet are unable to play after last update.  Loved it up until then.,1
"Overall not bad game, but it constantly has to reconnect to the server in the middle of battles, or calls, or messages. Plus I've had issues with the in-app purchases.",4
Good game,5
"Thanks,  we'll done",5
No you can't have money.,4
Its cool and all but we need new dungenstuff and wy not we get to pick the dungen type,4
"Thank you EA for bringing DK to Android.  IF EA can fix the disconnect issues that plague this game daily they might get some of my money because this is a 5 star game.  I will say it again, this is a great free game but until EA fixes the disconnect issues or installs a ticket creation system to make up for lost resources they will get no money from smart people like me.",5
"It's not a direct rip off of COC but it is the same type of game. It needs some serious work on the chat mechanism. But I do like the new dread stone addition, including the fact that you can't buy any, you can only earn it in game.",3
Game finally works,5
"Game blows now, thanks",1
"Last update ruins the gameplay. Special raids no longer give mana refill between waves and payoff is way too small to be worth it. Upgrading dark library means no mana for 13 days, not worth it. Uninstalling.",2
Dungeon keeper just got ruined by wait times micro transaction's and it keeps playing even when your not there really!??,1
It does not follow dungeon keeper 1 & 2 traditionally or theoretically no good guys to fight  (maybe because in one and two you korupted the world and now there is only dungeon keepers left to rule and fight over this new virtual underworld!) Not all the old school rooms and creatures are also here as well like fallen angel or vampire!  But i gave it a five star rating because Simple but intricete details of this mod version knockoff of dungeon keeper,5
Finally got it to load love it it's awesome,5
So excited they remade this game!!!! Love it!,5
"Not quite the same as bull frog's dungeon keeper. But still fun all the same. It's line castle crashers, but better.",5
Won't load past the first logo screenshot since the newest update! Help!!,5
"Enjoy the game ,but latest update has made it unplayable. Stuck in a loop trying to load dungeon.[UPDATE : GAME IS WORKING AGAIN ]",4
Fun nastalgece,5
"Requires manual updates every couple of weeks.  Load times are unbearable. Expect crashes at least once a day.  Recent updates are making the Game less fun for all but the top 1% of  players.      Game was fun(when it worked ), if tedious. Pay to advance faster.",1
EA thank you for the nostalgia,5
"The newest update won't connect me to the server. It keeps dropping me before I can even get in. Tried reinstall,  no luck.",4
"Trying to name my dungeon, but the keyboard doesn't work.",2
"I used to play Dungeon Keeper 2 on PC so I had to check this out. I was pleasantly reminded of the trappings of the dungeon keeper game, like a skin of the battle command or clash of clans games. You build a lair and set it up to defend yourself from attacks, while setting out to raid the lairs of others. You join a group for supportive benefits, in this case a guild. Add resource management and upgrading nearly every conceivable component, and you have that resource management/strategy game you may have already played under a different name. It works for me. 12/3/14- Having same issue as everyone else logging in. I miss my dungeon. Sigh...",4
"This 4.3 update I think close to 3mb in size broke my game. I've been playing the franchise for years as far back as PC . This game is a fresh approach to the old game.             My Galaxy S5 ran 4.2 just fine but once I load up the game I can not get anywhere due to a (""loading Dungeon bug"") where this happens until I close the game manually. I've reinstalled the update and the game. I'm broken now. Thanks for this.",1
9/1/14.  Love the game but got another situation where an update makes it unplayable. Please fix.      11/1/14.   Another update that makes it unplayable. Please fix,4
FIX LOG IN BUG!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!.,5
Keeps saying Imps are preparing your dungeon. Can't do anything. LG He,1
Now right after start-up it crashes and goes into a loop. Can't even play anymore. Galaxy S3,1
Game keeped crshing and reloading since the new 4.3 update,1
"Online tower defense style game. Great graphics and awesome voice acting. It's been my favorite android game for around 8 months now.  You never have to spend real money, everything is obtainable through playing.",1
"If you like clash of clan, you'll like this one",5
"I guess I'm not the only one.   I'm stuck at the loading screen that promps:  please wait while your imps prepare your dungeon.   Please fix,  thanks!",1
Since the recent update I can't play. It either won't connect to the sever or it will constantly say my minions are preparing my dungeon. The following was my review before this update.................................Have no complaints about the game so far. I like how you can earn the consumable currency (the kind that costs real money) so for once it doesn't really seem like a massive cash sink. On top of that it doesn't seem to use much data which is a really big relief after the last few games I played.,1
Game does not work after update! Keeps reloading dungeon over and over after last update! Fix ASAP don't look like I'm the only 1 with this problem,1
Droid phone. Its stuck in a loop. Rebooting over and over!,1
Fun game need patience and they need to test thier update before release last updated major fail.,4
"Haven't  been able to login after the 4.3 update. It keep saying the imps are  getting the dungeon ready. When the screen actually show the dungeon, it only jump out and , again, saying the imps are getting the dungeon ready.  What's  up with that?",1
Love the game till the new update no longer let's me play :(,1
Game no longer loads at all,1
"This is the best game I have ever played, this game is way better than I could ever hope for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)",5
2nd update in a row where game is unplayable. It now tries to load my dungeon over and over. Is there any testing done before deploying? This is embarrassing.,1
Add a way to recruit for guilds in the game and id give 5 stars!!,4
Fun seeing the old themes return. Really miss bring attacked by Hero forces.so glad to get raided by heroes once more! Hard but not impossible to risk spending real world money on the game.  This game is meant to be played at odd moments through the day rather than for hours on end like the pic version.,5
Lots of fun,5
Almost as good as clash of clans,5
Simply beautiful.,5
Better now but still some issues with bugs.,3
This is a really cool,5
Unbalanced raids. Construction takes way too long. Heavily favors in-app purchases. And latest update rendered the game unplayable. Constantly tries to reload dungeon.,1
"The new update is causing a crash on my galaxy s5. The game keeps  looping between the dungeon loading screen and my dungeon for a second or two before it goes back to the loading screen.  Tried to fix, even went as far as reinstalling, still same problem. Please patch.",4
Amazing remake of the original....great job EA for once....I recommend this game to anyone that wants to have fun and kill some time...and minions lol,5
Was entertaining until the currency change in a recent update required multiplayer rewards to upgrade the Heart.  Scrimped and saved stone then suddenly can't advance.  Killed it for me.,1
"As the title says. Had to update, won't let me play because it still says I need to update. I can't use the gems I paid real money for. Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling. Nobody from customer service ordered help. That's why I prefer small indie companies, they care about their ratings and reach out the community by offering support.",2
I loved it on the PC; and I'm loving it on here!,5
Too many cheating fuks in this game to be fun. Too many exploits to be fair. Dont waste your time.,1
Curious too see if it can be fun in the long haul.... but fun for killing time,4
LOVE IT BEST GAME EVER,5
The only thing I don't like about it is the constant internet connection required to play. I used to have this game on the comp. Love it. Update. Just got a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro and the graphics are excellent and so much more detailed. Fantastic game!,5
"The game keeps lagging and forcing me back to my dungeon at somewhat random moments. Usually when I'm building or raiding. Hopefully a future patch can fix this, but until that happens I guess I'll have to put the game on hold.",2
Lots of fun,5
"I have been playing this game for the last few weeks. Overall the game is ok. I mean, as a old timer, played all serial of the dungeon keepers, how can I say no to a cellphone version. YET, this game has almost NO creative at all. I have to agree with a lot of reviews out there, this game is basicall!y another version of clash of clan!! And it is not even close to good one. The part I hate the most? In what kind of right mind a dungeon has flying monsters that fly OVER wall? It is an underground dungeon!!!!",2
Love it almost like the pc version,5
Best game evah,5
"Almost too much fun.  Price of imps is a bit high, and I think you should be able to select more dirt/rock spots for scheduled dig out when they're done with the one they're on, but all in all a pretty good game.",4
Every time I try to type something in the keyboard it just disappears and it refuses to continue the game with out naming my base! Which I can't do obviously,1
I'm sick of getting disconnected every single raid. How am I supposed to get a win streak going?,1
...the original pc game was better.,4
Dungeon keeper for PC was one of my favorite games and this different take on that game keeps the feel of the original with also making it easy to play on mobile.,5
"Its nice. Simple yet entertaining, and fun to play with. Love it, love it, love it. :-]",5
Really great game to pass time and looks great. And who doesn't want to beat the crap out of something to work longer,5
Love this game on the pic just as much fun on this,5
Fun game so far...,5
Awesome Fun,5
Wont get past loading page.,1
"Since downloading it, it has been nothing but fun. You cant beat free and its just plain old fun. That was almost a year, still fun.",5
"Enjoyable, if it won't open uninstall and reinstall",4
Any one who has given money to any free-to-play game should go ahead and bury yourself.,1
Funny but interesting,4
"Read through the history of this game; theft, fraud, and an abomination against the original DK. Run away. They even found a way to prevent/impede people from leaving reviews lower than 4 stars...until they got caught.  Rotten. All my opinion. Do yourself a favor and stay away, stay very far away.",1
This app is fun and I enjoy the new things they've done with it but it wouldn't let me name my dungeon so that's why it has only 4 stars,4
Ok app. Just takes while for upgrades. & takes too many trophies for tournament qualifiers. Need to give more tournaments for lower guilds to get chance for winning or@ least stage equal tourneys by members/guilds that are in certain levels that will give higher guilds vs. Higher guilds. Lower guilds vs. Lower guilds...,3
"Completely overbearing ""micro"" transactions system.  $10 to add a minion, the final one cost $50?  $50 to add a pittance of functionality.  Also after you get over the initial hooks which happen quickly, expect to wait days for rooms to be upgraded.... unless you spend money.  Player skill is outmatched by he who spends the most wins.",1
Best game.,5
I swear I've played it years ago,5
Wow,2
It will not let me make a name for dungeon. So not much to see,1
Not worth the time,1
This game isn't fun anymore. I made my dungeon as hard as I could and I get raided 100% every time. Don't have enough gold to buy troops for revenge battles. Just don't play this. Its frustrating.,1
Awesome game but to much money for everything,3
Love playing this game. Great fun!!!,5
I love it but it acts weird on my tablet.,5
Easy to play but gameplay is not like the original . Still has a bit of humor and works well on my device. The pace is slow going if you don't want to pay to play. Updates enhance game play but there will be bugs. Overall a fun time for casual gaming.,4
"This type of building stuff and attack/defense game is time wasting. But this is DK, so I thought it would be different.   Each upgrade is expense, and it takes a lot of resources plus time. You got two builders (imps), and it will take monthes to get enough gems for another one. Easy to attack, hard to defense and each time you lose 1/3 of your resources. A clone of all other same type of games, and nothing good comes out from DK and DK2. Huge fan of DK, but even bigger disappointment at EA. 2 times worse.",1
I'll never stop loving dungeon keeper,5
"Pay to play ruins the pacing of a great game by grinding play to a halt until you shell out an average of $20 to buy a classic play experience. Download it, play it even pay money if you feel inclined but don't rate this game highly. This business model is gouging pure and simple.",1
Tons of fun and lots of repay value.,5
Goes to screen and updates refuses to connect afterwards,1
I can obviously see that peter molenough had absolutely no coalition with this what happened to the dungeon keeper franchise dungeon keeper 1 and 2 are better than this you can buy those games for 5 dollars on steam . com why would I pay your over priced micro transaction when I can the older  games for 5 dollars and those games have no in game payments,1
Slow at first... Be patient... You will improve fast....,5
Takes me back to the fun of the old PC game. Wish this was a little more like it..maybe for purchase with out the in app money grab.,5
Fun right off the bat.,5
I use to have this game totally awsome,5
Awesome graphics. Great game play. Needs more upgrades and cool stuff though.,5
This game is awsome I remember playing this game on the computer when I was younger,5
Lollipop keyboard not compatible,3
"I love this game it's very fun and requires a little level of intelligence  to create a dungeon that will halt any enemy attackers, very addicting.",5
Loved this game on the system love it on my phone,5
Since my posts are not being approved on the forum I'm giving 1 star until this loss bug gets fixed. I keep losing even though my dungeon doesn't get 50% damage or the heart destroyed. Get your $#1t together.,1
Totally awesome,5
Its a good game but it freezes a lot and kicks you off if it does it in the raid u lose automatically,3
Fun game...kinda old school!,4
Lame,1
"It a free to play, pay to win game. The AI of the mobs is beyond horrible. Trolls and bile demons commit suicide to attack their favorite room on the far side of the map. And in the 3000+ point range, keeping resources is darn near impossible. It stopped being 'fun' a long time ago. Deleting.",2
Epic,5
Gud,5
"Love playing everyday,  new challenges,",5
Fun,4
Great remake.  Very nostalgic.  Lacking in strategy.,4
"This is a decent recreation of the original the is both fun and as free as you want it to be. Pay to play or not, it is still fun.",5
Would not properly download,1
Get the old version for pc,1
"I have been raiding but just as i send the bulk of my minions in, the game drops and says they are fetting my dungeon in order. Terrible",1
Awesome. It makes me may Ss the original.,5
"I reached the point where I name my dungeon, and cannot enter any text. Touching anywhere on the on-screen keyboard exits the text editing field without entering any data, so I'm stuck there.",2
I remember this game from 10 years ago. Love the challenge,5
"Still a huge fan of the original, but this is awesome!",5
Puts a unique twist on dungeon grinding. Not too often I get to say EA actually made a good functioning game but they really hit it out of the ball park,5
Unable to play this app since It won't let me name my dungeon.. Fix this,1
"So far so good.  Enjoying immensely. Now completely lopsided and they know it..since last update, everything went towards the person paying extra real money to aquire boosts.  I havent won a single battle in weeks. And im pretty maxed out on upgrades.",2
I like it alot,4
Fun game with a great theme and a surprising amount of voice acting,5
"24 hours to dig through ONE BRICK?!?! It doesn't have to take that long though, if you're willing to shell out $100 at a time to fill your gems. No wonder the DK in the picture looks like he's got nuts for a chin... gettin' ready for us all to bend over. Again...what a joke.",3
Very easy to learn and straight forward ;),5
Very fun. Great graphics in HD,5
"May i suggest an introduction for a variety of new troops such as captured humans like the giants and lord of the land from pc version s, would set up some pretty cool story missionsüëπ",5
But I can not enter my name so I can't go any farther in the game.,1
Fun app,5
Wish you could sell rooms and traps. Also wish you didn't have to pay for stuff just to expedite,3
Great game!,5
It's a hoot!,5
The game.is.perfect like clash of clans,5
"As is the case with ALL freemium games, people who pay cash will get an edge over players who don't. However, the game has a great dark sense of humor, a bunch of fun little dungeon building mechanics, and it gives players plenty of chances to earn the premium currency instead of paying for it. All in all this game is fun, just be prepared to be patient.",5
Love it,5
Would love to expand my dungeon add a few more floors.....,3
"Before the combat currency, it took huge but doable amounts of materials to upgrade the dungeon heart. Now it looks is just impossible. Bring material building otherwise this just becomes buy to win. On the other note recruiting immortals with that was probably the best possible move for that section.",3
This game starts you out with plenty of gems to build up and learn with. Would be 5* if it didn't randomly crash on me.,4
"They made the game much more accessible to those who refuse to pay for ""free"" games.. Tons of fun and quite addicting!",5
Good,5
If you like clash of clan you'll like this game,5
Game keeps making me download 53mbs when I am not connected to WiFi. To much data use...,2
"This is an Incredibly fun game to play now that I have it on my phone. The gems however take entirely to long to accumulate in other words they are TO HARD TO COME BY, and the upgrades take way to long. The Imps, OMG, they are way too  costly. 800 gems for a the third that's crazy. It went from 40 to 800 wow that's ridiculous, I'm scared to think what the fourth or fifth or even worse sixth and so on will cost. Lamo",2
Loving playing this game again on my cell. Just as addicting as it was on my computer. Well done!,5
"I'm taking one star away. The reason is because the game will sometimes stop right in the middle of an attack. Please do something to fix this or at least compensate for when it does happen. I think if you can't keep it from happening, you should give a free resupply and allow us to keep any resources gained. I still love the game and I hope you guys will make it better. I will rate again with 5 stars when the issue is resolved. Keep up the good work.",4
Eeehhh,3
"Funny, Great, Awesome...blah blah blah. I cant put my phone down !",5
Addictive!,5
And a suitable homage to the original game.,5
Been waiting for DK3 for years. A bit cartoony compared to the old ones but still good. Just wish you could rotate the isotropic view.,5
"The game is nearly unplayable due to the extreme delays to simple things such as the number of imps you have or the generation of gems etc. EA has taken away the heart and soul of this game and turned it into a gigantic series of  microtransactions. There is no shame in waiting for items to generate or build rooms etc, but when a single tile of gems takes 4 hours to dig out, and your are offered the option of rushing the order for 49 green gems and your return is only 3 to 4 gems, it is very frustrating. Also when raiding other dungeons, even if my minions are not harmed I am still forced to pay 1 to 2 gems to resupply, otherwise if I return to the (my) dungeon I lose my minions and am forced to resummon (ie pay gold) to bring the minions back into my domain.   Sadly I will be uninstalling, and I am very disappointed in the revival of this game.",1
Great game...works well on both my devices.,5
Love,5
"I loved the original pc version. I just want to build the dungeon and ward off the ""good guys""...as much as this is fun, I miss the simplicity of the original",3
"If it didn't crash every  3 minutes wouldn't be to bad. The times to upgrade are a bad joke. Gems are a pain to get.   Purchase didn't show so I didn't get the bonus that made the purchase worth it . can't log in it was just crashing all the time , now I can't even load . last update fubared the game. If I could give a half a star I would.",1
If I want to play a game then I should not have to wait a lifetime to have something done . Just another one of those games that you just have to pay to have fun or wait for it to tell you when you can play.   I love the old bull frog games but this is not a bullfrog game. So far us oldies no not a fun game,1
"Exited me out during about 4 multiple exclusive raids, even when i had good Internet not the first time either, and now it wants me to give thirty gems to retry, and it was certain I was going to win the raids. Will rate five if compensated and problem fixed",1
"Gameplay awesome and I,m sorry for the people I attacked. But I got a lot of loot.",5
"This game requires a constant connection, which is fine since it isn't really a data hog.",4
Just like the oldy,5
Avid fan...keep it up@UR end*,4
Excellent game play,5
Good casual fun.,4
Seems OK so far,4
Won't let me name my dungeon please fix!,1
The game used to work great until the Lollipop update.  I did a full factory reset and it seems super choppy.  Maybe it just needs optimizing for the new version of android.,4
He,5
"Crashes fixed, still a lot of micro purchase bait.",3
Great game so far. Brings back memories.,5
The raid pairing system ruined the game play please fix and make it fair. Also add in a bonus for guild LTs to inspire competition for guild leadership. Right now it's just a title with no reward.,5
Have to have internet to play boo,3
Being played this game since they create it on computer,5
"Best game ever I just love ""horny""",5
"I loved the original, and though this isn't a direct port, it still has some of the charm of the original.",4
The game is getting more and more unplayable. In every battle it will freeze and reset itself. Little to no support on the problem. Uninstalling today.,2
It's OK tho... But nothing compared to the original...,3
"I love this game and the few others out there that I have played across a few consoles but when I got this game I somehow acquired 14,000 green stones and I got really excited (weirded out too) and of course started getting stuff with them and took a break to do my morning routine, only to come back to play and everything was gone and I had to start all over. I'm extremely upset and can't believe this happened....please help and I will boost up to 5 stars because this game does deserve it",2
Can't get enough,5
Game works well.,5
"I played this game waaaaay back....still addicted....buuuut that being said, I hate the pay to play crap. Imps didn't ever take THAT long. Total bs!",4
"Can't name my dungeon, messes up even with a droid maxx",3
Ever since the bugs have bin delt with. Game runs smothly no hickups. The hast to administer to this conumdrum has bin much appreciated,5
If anything this game would have been enjoyable IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE PAYWALL,1
Yo EA fix the update its not even letting. Me play wow,2
"I wish it did referral rewards for friends. I've told like four people, and they all play it. They're playing more of this than Clash of Clans (they used to love it, so that tells you about this game). It'd be a nice incentive for making people play it. A gem mine would be nice too (and very helpful). You'd definitely move to #1 (in strategy)! I hope y'all take this into consideration. I love this Game. It deserves the #1 spot...definitely better than CoC!!!",5
"When it decides to let you play, it is fantastic!",4
Hard to figure how to improve after tutorial,3
Still Sofa king fun,5
"Find it slightly better than clash of clans. definitely the top 10 of this type of game fun loving and witty, sadistic sense of humor.",4
"I am a patient player of this game and will wait for days to upgrade rooms and traps, so with that in mind, I love playing this one. I spend maybe 5 minutes to raid someone's dungeon, then I'm off the game for the next few hours. If you are patient, or willing to pay for gems, this one is for you.",5
Uninstall. Shut down. Power up. Install. Could be cleaner but this worked.,4
Update occur with no update abilities. Please fix glitch.10 Nov 2014.,5
Update fail,1
Redirected to Google Play for update but update is done. tried uninstalling and reinstalling with no luck same problem.,2
ATTENTION: If your going to play this game prepare to get disconnected frequently no matter how short or long your playing. The creator made it this way so people spend more gems or money. If ur going to play do not waste ur gems nor spend money on this game. I would give this game a 1/4 star out of 5. You will experience getting Disconnected a lot. 9-22-14  During game play the app. will shut down..    10-22-14 During game play the game sends me to the loading screen making me lose that battle.,1
Installed the update today 11/10/14 and now the game just routes me to update. Way to ruin my play. Will change review when fixed,1
Can't play after update.  Please fix,2
Locked out due to update also I have put alot of money in this game and I'm really mad been playing for a year,4
update fail,1
Was fun until new update. Done with it. Uninstall.,1
"Update made the game absolutely unplayable. If you're reading this, chances are you won't be able to play either",1
Issue with UPDATES not launching app after install.,2
"Great game, I like it a lot, but update sometime break the game for a while. Also if like me you don't want to pay, you must be patient",4
Update required but there's no update....,1
I already updated it... and it won't let me play..... EA YOU SUCK...,1
Due to overly large build times and EA's quest to drain your wallet dry. If your unwilling to spend money (like me) this game is slow and tedious.  I'm still playing it so that says something (not sure what :-) ),3
Update is not great news.  You have broken the game.  How long are you leaving this broken?  Patch with no testing and go home!?!?,1
Updated - busted infinite update loop,1
"""Update Required"" and redirect to Google Play. I already have applied the update. Considering these are the people who brought you Origin, what do you expect?",1
You have to keep paying more and more to play. Don't waste your time and shame on EA,1
Latest update doesn't..... Back to five stars when it does.,1
"Game says you need an update but even after doing so, same message....",1
"It says update is required, then takes me to play store but no update button, why won't it let me play",4
Update broke game wtf,2
Ever heard of beta testing before launching? You'd think EA hired Microsoft's programmers for how buggy the updates of ANY game tend to be.,2
Unplayable with the lastest update,1
Wtf... Update locked me,1
Game keeps telling me to update but no update available. Can't play the game anymore. They really need to get on a fix ASAP.,1
Update problem makes it so I cannot play. WTF?,1
Doesn't let me play,4
"The game keeps telling me that there is an update available, but google says it is up-to-date. Wtf?",1
Sad that this is what the original game has come to.  Not that engaging but OK.  Main issue is buggy updates that are a little hit or miss.,3
"Spells no longer deliver damage... Before update level 5 bomb spell destroyed 6x6, now it's back to 1x1. Currency change is also bs",3
It updated now Won't let me play please fix,1
Awesome game but phantom update,3
Is life at EA so bad that NO ONE tested the latest update before releasing it?   Now the game is broken and can no longer be played.   Please refund the money I spent on crystals EA as I can no longer get into the game to use them.   Sad sad state of affairs EA...  Would give zero stars if I could.,1
Allot of crashes when attacking. If you have no patience this game is not for you.,2
Phantom update required. Please fix soon before I get withdrawls! Lol,3
"I updated it it tells me""good news a new update is available!"" When i already have the update",5
The game wont even load up. 1 star,1
It says you need an update required even though you can't do anything about updating the app!Other than that I cant rate it because I can't even get into the app! ):&lt;,1
"Installed the update. Run game... ""an update is required"". No update is available. Uninstalled game, reinstalled. Run game... ""an update is required"". Literally cannot play anymore!",1
Amazing,5
Almost like the original game,5
Nice,4
Its fun and reminds me a lot of the original,5
"This games has great graphics.  The gameplay is interesting and challenging, but unless you want to spend cash it is slow going.  So far I have not spent any money, but I can only play for an hour or so and then turn it off until the next day, when my dungeon ""improvements"" (evil laugh here) will be done.",3
"Fun game, you can play well without spending money, so get it...",5
Awesome,5
"Love this game, reminds me of the original and i just can't stop playing it,  i had to go and buy dungeon keepers 2 as well, awesome game",5
Not a bad time killer its still a little heavy on a pay to win game.,4
"Fun game from PC days,  you don't have to spend on this one.",5
"Had this ages ago for pc, still fun and on mobile!!",5
I have had this game a few days.  It drains my battery pretty quick.  Galaxy S4 but it is well worth it.,5
"I used to play this game on my computer...I have heard some people complain about how its pay to win but isn't every game? I have more fun on this one than any of the other ""battle/clan""games",5
Great game.,5
"my thirst (not that I noticed it till this game) is unquenchable!!  love it! I command u to download, dungeon keeper!",5
I love it,5
Brings back a lot of memories.,5
Love it,5
Cant even name the dungeon,1
It's a strategy game,5
I like it so far.. Time will tell if I'm able to do anything without having to dish out real cash,3
Great game,5
Great game.  Some crashing issues. All in all better than the first two.,4
Only after 4 hours into the game do you realize opening gold mines and quarries creates an irreversible weaknes... also employs very aggressive microtransactions for real money.  Destroys the game.,1
"Bravo, EA, the keyboard doesn't work in game! Why is this an issue? I've encountered the hardest boss of all time, that's why! Naming my tutorial dungeon is impossible....",1
"Yeah, the purchases are stupid, the time requirements are horrendous, but it's not that bad if you're not trying to play for hours at a time",4
"One word, awesomeness. It has quickly become my favorite pastime.",5
why?,1
Game is garbage compared to the original.  EA micro-transactioned this game to death and it's not fun to play at all.,1
"Interesting game play, and a fun follow up to a classic game. However I am not a fan of pay to win.",4
Really enjoying this game!!!,5
Cool,5
"Been loving this game since I got it! Had my doubts when I first started playing, but its turned out to be one of my favorite mobile games",5
I don't know because of the new update but in pvp all the time drop off....That's annoying loosing like that all the time....waste my gold and time...plz fix it...Another thing this new trap's are BS.if you are not in the top clan impossible to get the purple stone,2
The games a scam.,1
"I really liked the original, and was pretty annoyed at EA`s glitchy remake, but the tablet play is much better, very happy with my experience",5
Horrible A.I. that is hit or miss every game..and updates that change the rules as they go..even after you have (paid) for game currency,1
I can't give it more than 3 stars though because it tells me I can't connect to server way too often.,3
Not as good as the original computer version but still pretty good.,5
"There should be some kind of story,",2
"If you like setting up diabolical gauntlets for others to rage quiet over, you've found your game.",4
I cant log in looks so fun but cant play it. Plz fix!!!,1
"Six months back I would've given this game 5 stars: (a) it was very fun, (b) it worked. However the last two ""updates"" have essentially broken gameplay. I can no longer attack anyone without the game timing out mid-battle...Causing me to lose trophies and resources. Sorry EA, but you're losing your fan base...Fix the issues before adding new features.",3
Some Times when attempting to attack game freezes it can cause a loss.,3
"I heard about the minion wallpaper and would like to try it sometime,but I can't find it..",4
Screw micro transactions!!!! Are you serious EA??,1
Game starts for about two seconds then says loading starts again then back to the loading screen,1
Not to bad but run out of gems quick,4
I loved the original 2 for pc and this really takes me back,5
"Seems lately the game has been having an issue with calculating percent damage done.  Over a dozen times now while attacking I get over 51% and even see the star awarded, but when it goes to summary page gives a different (lower) percent damage and no star!  In looking back over defensive replays have noticed same discrepancy.  Summary page and results dont match up with what actually happened in the attack.. please fix! Very frustrating..",2
Can't connect. Been a week since i could play!!,1
One of the few Pvp games that I can play for a few minutes at a time.,5
I think this game has some very interesting gameplay.,5
"connection problem.... connection problem, connection problem. Its a good game when it works!",2
Fun enough. Play when not playing CoC or BB.,4
Awesome sauce,5
"I loved this game when it was on PC. This version is OK. I had troubles getting the game to enter my dungeon name, not able to access raids and then it would restart at a later point and I would have to redo some things. But this is a really fun game!",4
I don't see umps fixing it,1
Love this game,5
Too much demand on time based garbage,3
Really not happy with the survival raid updates.  Hope you come to your senses and put things back and get rid of all these really powerful characters that players don't have access to.  I used to love this game it is said when a developer updates himself into the flop house.  Lower the minion summoning time.,1
Drowning in bullshit microtransactions.,1
"Good game, but only playable if you want to shell out 30 bucks",3
"Amusing gameplay. Loading is annoying, but tolerable.  Highly recommend!  Connection issues are generally tolerable if you aren't a die hard gamer, but I subtracted a star for those. Developers,  well done. (Once again downgrading the rating because of disconnect problems)",3
I love the graphics but some of the challanges are harder than others,4
Fun game. Sometimes unstable and crashes.  Getting the new content is interesting.,4
"Alot of changes and will take a bit of getting use to, but still Loving It!!!! Getting Better all the time!!!",5
Wicked fun!,5
Here is a suggestion.  Reboot. Let player pick dungeon keeper or dungeon raider. ( one on surface one below) clans can reinforce on a raid or on defense.,5
Loved the pc game now I can play on the tablet so much fun.,4
"Great game! Kept with it, got better! :D (must play more now!) Design your Dungeon any way you want... I don't understand such low scores.",5
"It took me a minute to warm up to DK but once I did, it became a burn! Give it a shot. You'll probably be surprised how much you'll enjoy it",5
Highly addictive. My favorite android game. Thanks EA for knockin it outta the park! My only gripe would be being attacked by people that must have spent money because our trophies are similar but they are advanced way beyond me. Unleashing attacks on my Dungeon I've never seen or was prepared for.,5
Garbage,1
Another amazing game ruined  by micro transactions.,1
Asks me to name my dungeon then won't let me type uninstalled and reinstalled still same problem.,1
Come out with more traps an turrets,3
I've always loved dungeon keepers. I'm glad to be playing it again.,5
Play has improved in last updates.  It still asks for a lot of $$ but playable without it.,4
"Not the PC game of my youth, but most excellent for an Android game.",5
Mega disappointment the update completely messed up every time I try and play it always crashes + this dungeon keeper is a disgrace to the franchise if it wasn't so cartoony and more like the dungeon keeper 1&2  I would def spend money but this version is not worth my time nor a penny glad I still have my the PC versions of the game,1
Pretty good game,4
"This new update is as stupid as they come. Not only did i waste my money on green gems, but I cant even use the ones i have. So you come out with a new type of in game currency. Your game crashes everytime i play or attack anyone making it imposible to obtain any of this new currency.  Im done playing no point now. One star for you. I would go lower but thats the lowest.",1
I loved it it was grate,5
Fun so far.  HR is funny and makes the game amusing and interesting.,4
"I love the game, but HAAAATTTEEEE when it crashes (prematurely ends) a raid in progress, and ALL THE FREAKING MORE when i have already eliminated yhe enemy keepers heart and am DENIED CREDIT for it.  I cannot in good conscience give this app a worthy rating until this is fixed.",2
"Like it says, its good to be bad.",5
I wish I could give it a better rating love it when it works but fails connection 97% of the time. And it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Used multiple devices and internet connections,1
"I wish they would think about reverse spending. Meaning if my gold is full I could trade it for 3/4 the value for Gems. So if I had 1,500,000 in gold I could trade it for 540 Gems.",5
"Game is great, chat feature and recruiting ability, not so much.",5
Funny and cool love slapping faces,5
Excessive amount of pay walls to the point where you can't progress without paying it's not even worth downloading very disappointed since I'm a huge fan of the original PC games,1
Been playing for over a year now! And it keeps getting better!!!,5
"The game was made to be competitive, only way to get gold is fight but the game crashes during battles 80% of time causing loss of trophies and resources not to mention frustration of loosing due to lag. Forget about completing a survival raid, the game will crash on wave 8 or 9.   Update: most connectivity issues had been fixed. The battles work and do not crush while using bad connection.",4
"Very good game, however, the game screwed me over and spent the 2500 gems I've been saving up for imp #6 on about 4,000,000 gold. Besides that, I get booted out of someone's dungeon, telling me to please wait while my dungeon is straightened out, just to tell me there is an exclusive survival raid available. I lose my troops, the immortal I captured, the resources, and the raid. No combat points. I am VERY disappointed. :(",2
Fun lots of laughs,4
My phone has been going off non stop.. reminds me of pirates.. attacked in seconds of making..this game offers nothing cept long grinding times and is very annoying,1
I am willing to spend a little moola on this one simply because they don't ask to sift through all of your info. CoC gameplay with an amusing announcer. Go Horny!,4
Fun,5
Awesome game you dont need money if you got the time to build up your dungeon suckas,5
"I love this game. I never have more than a few minutes time here and there to play, so I have had the patience to build a well-designed and defensible dungeon without spending a dime. It's been great fun and I hope it stays around for years to come!",5
Struggling with dig times on tiles.,3
"Was a good game, but after you get the hang of how to play you should be able to restart your dungeon. It is BS that you cannot remove or replace the rooms if you do not like where you put them while you were learning to play",2
"Love this Game, though the whole multilayer aspect is silly, I love to see it ported to android!",5
Love it,5
"Update, if I could lower this score I would.  I tried playing it again because I was bored.  Mistake.  Stupid in app purchases are the only way to get things done in this game.  It took a week to get 800 gems to buy a third imp, required to build things.  Build times are 24 hours for many things shutting you down for a day. Or you can buy an imp for $10 but watch out the 4th is even more.  Expect to spend $50 or a massive amount of time on this game.",1
Love dk games this ones interesting! !!,4
Very fun and unique,5
It's Ea nuff said. Too bad they really know how to ruin fun games,1
Not sure what the upgrade times will be like but so far it is fun.,4
"One of the only games I play, runs like an evil version of clash of clans. Really feeds into my diabolical side",5
May not be the same as PC but impressive game as a mobile app. Recommend using a tablet though. If you are patient you can spread out cost of real $$.,5
Its ok,4
"The free to play system drags down this game a bit, Needs more ways to earn gems without paying real money.",3
Never played. But I play Scrabble. Haven't been able to log in for ELEVEN days. Should be more of a priority for an online game.,1
Leave it to E.A. to take a classic killer game by the folks at Bullfrog I think and turn it into a steaming pile of #/$‚Ç¨. Thanks again E.A.,1
Love this game,5
"That's the only game I am playing currently. Solid game, Graphics are awesome, Horny is devilishly funny. So far so good no complains. Now about spending money ..... well this is your decision that's a game and nothing is for free, don't forget many people spend hours to build this for us so we can have some fun,  so stop bitching and complaining people cause your IMPs wouldn't multiple.",5
It's decent.,3
Nice game,4
"Great game to play over time. Don't compare it to the PC version, its a different game. This is an excellent game to play in small increments over a long period of time.",5
Spend more time than im proud to say on this game.  Check it out.,4
Takes forever to get more imps but still fun outweighs the issue,5
I love it,5
In my opinion this is the best strategy game out there,5
I like the pc game but this will work.....,5
Awesome game,5
When I try to press a key to name my dungeon the keyboard closes I don't know if its a problem on my end or yours but I'd really like a fix.,2
Make the game cost a fee and take out the gems. The pay to win model is extremely intrusive and a horrible way to play.,1
It won't let me play cuz I can't type the name of the dungeon the keypad just keeps going away whenever I try to type,4
I loved this game on PC. This is way to kiddish. But it did make me go on like and buy the original games. That's the only reason I gave it two stars,2
So frequently I can't get past the tutorial. Very disappointed.,1
Great homage to an epic franchise!,5
Not the real thing but still fun,4
Fun game love it!!,5
Lots of microtransactions but the concept and playabillity are there if you can deal with the waiting (hence the microtransactions)it is entertaining.,4
"As a professional coder, this game has some good things going for it. but like many the High cost bracket in-game items as well as real money purchases is it's downfall & will reveal that, if they don't consider it  soon. Easy come easy go is the world of ftp app based gaming, someone with less greed, and a crappier game will prevail. Don't listen to me what do I know. I'm just a coder with 22 yrs experience that has worked 7 years in the ftp game market, more recently mythic ent. Get a clue b4 it gets you.",3
Really loved the original dungeon keeper series. Not a big fan of the free to play games that most companies put out there. This one isnt too bad. Other than the initial purchase of some Imps to speed things along you really dont need to purchase gems. Games play is fun and engading. Really funny antics from main game voice over. Great game. I do hope they add some more features.,4
You have to be someone that's not in a rush,5
Awesome,5
Its good game,4
I like the game,5
Badass good graphics good story fun for a long time recommend downloading,5
"I seen comments thatthos game  makes u spend money,I saw plants vs zombies 2 and one comment said u need to spend money too.soithink EA is trying t get money from players",1
I like a game I can sit down and put an hour or two into. This game requires looking at it walking away for hours at a time. It's terrible. EA ruins another game. :(,1
One of the most addictive games I have play in while!,5
There is a lot of micro transactions,4
Love this app I can't stop playing! Just one suggestion make it so that you can play on other things but tablets. But other than that this game incredible.,5
"It could've been an awesome game, but the insanely long wait times for anything to get done are a killer for me. I have 30 minutes to play right now. Probably not in 6 hours. And the IAP prices are just as insane as the wait times.",3
Fun game slapping the imps around is fun and the game requires some skill to set up a nice defense,4
"My game is just awful! Every time I open the app, it takes forever to load! And when it does, everything is white, dull blockes.Fix this, and I MIGHT change it.",2
"Loved both PC versions. Wondered if it would ever translate to mobile. Of course there are in game purchases, but I've never used it and I am happy.",5
Very easy to get into this game,5
I got to the end really quick. Now I got nothing to do. Didn't spend a dime. Attacks were really easy for the first few month's. Then they made it impossible to complete any attack. So I got bored stopped playing for a couple month's. Started playing again the other day got bored in about 20 minutes. Realized how much space this game was taking up on my phone and decided today to delete the game.,2
Like many others I love the original. I knew I had a problem when this one said it would take 4 hours to dig one square. I would love to really play Dungeon Keeper on my phone.,2
Fun,4
Great for the times that are free,5
Good game but to slow without spending real money,4
"Just upgraded to samsung galaxy with android 4.1 and now it crashes all the time, practically unusable now. I have had tons of fun plaing on my old phone and hope that an update will come out soon and fix the crashes. Fantastic game, despite the recent glitches.",5
Wish there was a version you could purchase up front instead of this in app purchase crap.,2
Excellent detail,5
EPIC,5
"Been waiting a while for the DOOR wftow beta completion and hoping for some new game. Here it is! So far I love it. Now, where is the next Splatter House?",5
I like the game and you should download it because you can raid other people's dungeon,5
Its like a crazy mash up of so many great games its hard to describe it. Plays flawlessly on my flex 8 and the visuals are stunning. Great game and I would recommend to anyone trying to kill some time.,5
"It IS a fun game,  but the way the game is set up is pretty draconian if you don't buy extra workers.  Further, you can pay for Primus status for extra resources when you win in PvP, but not having it isn't crippling.  Finally,  nostgia factor. They kept true to the original in some aspects,  most notably the Advisor, and tunnelling,  but the monsters are insufferably cartoonish, and the game play itself is solidly Clash of Clans like.",3
Very similar to the original it has a bit of differences. But it's a must have game,5
I like the imp and when you slap them that work faster :),5
Should be more like the game was on pc... imps need to be obtainable and game needs single player mode... make imps available for gathered resources. Game too focused on multiplayer inho... Should be playable without internet for traveling... stuff like that would get higher rating. Too money dependent,1
Wish it as true to the original,4
"Well, this is not really like the original Dungeon Keeper, but as a tower defence game it has a lot of strategic depth. It takes a while starting out but gets fun as you level up. Yes, if you want to upgrade and train minions fast you'll have to spend real cash, but if you're patient and play the game when you got a few minutes to kill it feels more rewarding. The in-game currency is not limited to cash purchases, and can be earned by meeting objectives. The game becomes really competitive in the tournament",5
"This was a great game but now that I am pretty deep into the game it kicks me off about 50% of my raids.  My signal is great and honestly I have spent about 20 dollars on this game.  Which is 20 dollars more than I have spent on any other game but wish I had it back.  Just skip this game and play something else.  EA, please fix this problem",3
Really cool game reminds me of the pc version from years ago,5
Love it. Yeah u have to spend $ but how else would a free game be even more awesomer,5
the original took less time to do things think they should release a version that's offline I'd pay for it 10-20$,3
I still play the early pc versions of this game via dosbox. Quite a bit different than those versions but still close enough to be recognizable. I progress slowly because i won't spend much to advance.,4
Turn back now or let this suck money from your anus,1
Lots of fun but slow to advance if you don't pay for in app purchases,4
"I am a huge fan of the original. This game is a good homage to it but it falls short in reliability. I cannot participate in raids or exclusive content for more than 10 to 15 seconds before the game crashes and I lose my resources and gems. The times required to build excavate are too excessive, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money. Don't get me wrong I love the game, but this version of it needs a lot of work before it can be called fun.",1
"Still a few bugs.Minions bound to the guild chamber don't follow it when I move it, I have to restart the game. What about more changes,  the game has gotten a Ltl slow/ boring? Now you have added pop up adds in the initial startup, if I want something I know how to find it. Dropping a star just for that!",3
"For newbies: When you start playing, the game will offer you a ""free imp with your first purchase"". I suggest you partake... but wait: you have 72 hours to do this. Be patient, and spend some time digging your dungeon and upgrading. You will get enough gems to purchase the 3rd imp on your own, and THEN make a purchase. What happens is that you'll get the 4th (more expensive) imp for free.  Other than that, this is a fun game. The graphics are good, and not the basic auto CAD style of gameplay. The updates over that past year give you a little more to enjoy, but the core of build-dungeon, raid-others is intact and the most important aspect.",4
Timed calculations and maneuvers.,4
Debating on deleting after so long due to the game force closing. I can't even play it now. I loved it before and played it all the time.,2
"Requires too much real money to advance at a reasonable pace.  I've read some of the other comments, and if so many are complaining about the cost,  consider lowering them.   You are loosing valuable players.",2
As an original DK fan I hesitated to download but have actually enjoyed this quite a bit in it's current form.    Some tasks take way to long to complete but I have yet to invest any money in the game.,4
"EA, stick to games that you made on your own. The original dungeon keeper was far better. Just go back to the Sims. You're actually appreciated there.",1
Fun as he'll.... it's exactly how I pictured it would be on a phone.   N if your smart at what you up grade you'll. Do fine... just like any other game.... I played this as a kid on the computer an this is perfect...  just wish there was that spell where you could be one of your minions... but don't think I'm complaining cause I'm not good job,5
For the past several days I have not been able to get into my raids please fix this so I can get back to enjoying this game,3
Read the privacy policy,1
Great combination of tower defense and city building!,5
"Love the comedy involved in this game, and how can you go wrong with demons, imps and other vile creatures of the underworld. Very fun and addictive. Would definitely recommend it to most of my metal head friends.",4
"EA, it's not smart to update a game to push your players back a few steps from the progress they have already made. It already takes months to progress. Tsk, tsk. Down-rating to one stars. Raids are messed up! Entered a dungeon, released minions and half were immediately ejected, not from spring trap. WTF?",1
Good stuff,5
"Fantastic game! Love the voice over, the strategy, and the over all quality. You cannot find any other game like it anywhere. It is addicting and worth anytime I have spent into it. You can tell the people who have a hand in makinf this game possible know what they are doing. Thank you kindly.",5
Loved this game since it first came out for pc. Love it even more now!,5
"If you win and the game crashes (which it does frequently), it counts as a loss a lot of the time.",2
Fantastic!,5
Enjoying it so far.  3 stars do not like how it keeps turning on the notifications once I turn them off,3
I have a blast every time i play,5
"I've been playing a while, but there are things I hate about it. One, some idiot changed it so you can't collapse the minion bar in battle and it gets in the way of things on the bottom of the screen. Like entry points. If connection is lost things aren't saved, like the fact you're in the middle of a raid and have put minions and and elixir into it. And you can't re-enter without spending gems. The game is about spending money. Things move slow otherwise. Fixing those things would improve my review.",2
Works good now! Thanks.,5
"You know how many times I beat another dungeon, lost my minions and wasn't even rewarded? I hate that. It will let you start a raid and then towards the end of it when you've attacked and destroyed the heart it says ""minions are getting things in order'"" and makes you lose everything. This game needs an update pronto because I really like it.",3
This game has to reload the dungeon regardless of connection and it shuts down in the middle of raids. As you get further it's impossible to progress. Don't download this app. Go for clash of clans.,1
"But more fun in my opinion, needs a way to manage buildings better. Its a real pain to rearrange your dungeon. All this talk about pay to win is silly, the game throws gems at you every turn, more so than clash ever has.",4
Nice twist on this game. It is worth checking out! Very addictive.,5
It takes forever to load and them when it finaly does load it says it needs 137 mb so I delete some old games and then it STILL say I need 137 mb. I would give zero stars if I could,1
"This game is always losing connection specially in raids dungeon, but happen most of the time now.",2
Imagine your favorite game turned into a crappy mobile game where you stand around and do nothing for a while,1
All time favorite game,5
Ive played for quite some time .. I had to switch to an lg motion and browsed forums and many have this issue .. I get a cant connect with a retry with a full signal i have tried clearing data chaches uninstallimg.reinstalling. The post in the forums were quite a while.back and im guessing you havent taken the initiative to fix this .. I will rate again if fixed . And yes its pay to play but the updates have made it more fair than it use to be.,3
"There needs to be a function to quickly reorganize your dungeon... I'm tired of moving each room, trap, etc one at a time. Also, I'm having issues connecting to the servers even though my network is fine...",2
Just disapointed in this game. The inability to properly rate the game from the app means the raiting is sckewed. The game itself hits a glass celling that forces pvp.,1
This is a highly :-) enjoyable game,4
Love the game so far...love dungeon keeper the PC game as well...thanks for bring back the memories....,5
Awesome game so addicted,5
It's fun and challenging,4
"Pay to win, otherwise you can't get anywhere, and elites trample on everyone else....",1
It's a fantastic app. Fantastic graphics,5
"They took my favorite old computer game,  and turned it into something that syphons cash. You have to spend at least $100 to enjoy this now. I'd spend $20 to have it play without in app purchases. As is, I'm uninstalling.",1
"loved it. Fan of PC version, fan of this version.",5
The ai is reminiscent of the original pc games released in the 90s before many college students were born. The matchmaking system is pretty terrible.  Either you lose 90% defense or you win 95% depending on if it puts you in a bracket way above or way below your paygrade.,3
The game itself is f****** awesome however the service blows donkey dick,5
Great,5
Nice game,5
"Loosely based on Bullfrog's pc god-game, Dungeon Keeper.",3
Great game love the voice inputs,4
Thoroughly enjoy it.,5
I like the game... Been playing it for months now... You gotta have patience if you not down with spending money on games,5
It's a great game,5
Beautifully crafted but they paywalled it to death.  Get above level 10 (it only takes a few days) and you won't be able to even scratch your nose in a timely manner without buying in-game currency.  Uninstalled.,1
Much better than clash of clans,5
Its ...... its.... AWESOME,5
Good solid game. Similar to the rest of the base building games. Takes a good amount of time but the gem rewards and drops from mining get you more imps. I'm up to 5 and I haven't spent any money. Would like too see re-enforced wall limit raised to 150,4
more fun then i expected.,5
"As if it weren't bad enough to ruin the concept of the Dungeon Keeper name, the game is very unstable. Half the time you end up at a loading screen or the game itself keeps crashing. Also not a favorable note to force people to grind for additional imps unless they pay you money. Kindly go back to making halfway decent games for 5.99 instead for ruining cult classics EA",2
I was a fan of the pc version and now I can take it everywhere,5
Build time gets to be too long. The game is very expensive or you spend days waiting. Fun otherwise.,3
"Making your own dungeon to defend is fun, you should add more minions (troops) and immortals too.",5
"Haven't played long, but i definitely like this game thus far",4
"Fantastic game. If only you didn't have to BUY advancements. Seriously? 24 hours to dig out one block? Why not just charge $20 for the game once instead of nickel and dimeing your players to death? On the scale of evil, the game makes have put all keepers to shame! BOOO!",3
"I loved DK and DK2, and this brings back the memories. The only thing I don't like is how things are so catered around spending money to upgrade, etc.",4
Love this game,5
"New dark take on castle defense. Upgrade ur units, rooms, ext, no need to spend money, bada$$....come see me....and die trying....and I NVR spent a penny",5
"I know the publishers rely on ads for their income, would be nice if there could be slightly less nagging.",4
great game. server errors every day all day. impossible to play,1
The app is ok and all....but it's just not the same as the PC version. I can deal with it crashing.,1
I like it.,4
"I enjoyed the original version of this game years ago so was looking forward to playing this. They have adapted it pretty well and it is fun but... The game takes ages to load before you can play. I've tried it on both phone and tablet and the load time is painful. It also has a tendency to hang while you're playing, bringing up loading messages for more waiting fun. This tends to happens at the most inconvenient times like in the middle of a raid which means you auto-lose the fight, bonuses and minions.",3
You can have mild amusement while sitting on the toilet but once you get a few levels up you realize this is a game for nothing but whales.,1
Lots of thought needed for strategy,5
"It's a good game, but it keeps crashing.",2
"At this point, I am not able to go out and attack others.  When I try, I see their dungeon briefly, before I get taken back to the screen where I am loading my dungeon again.  Of the past 25 minutes or so I have attempted to play, I have spent approximately 23 of it in one loading screen or another.  When attempting to look for support on the developer's webpage, the game isn't listed as one that's supported.  Way to go EA.  I somehow expected more from you.",2
Amazing,5
Crappy disservice to the original,1
Way better then the original game the fact its got peoples panties twisted is even better the only down fall is the HP of the characters they should be a lot stronger and the PvP portion should reflect the actual strength of those characters,5
Very true to the original.,4
Addictively Awesome!!!!,4
Free to play with optional micro transactions.,4
Not quite like the original but still lots of fun,5
BIT SLOW AT TIMES BUT FUN REGUARDLESS. I RECOMMEND. ENJOY.,5
Gig'em,5
really kills the boredom,5
App load time should be faster,4
"I played the original dungeon keeper games, and while I'm glad to see some action in the franchise this game is disappointing. It's not well-balanced, the costs are too high, and there is a lot of grinding in the game.",3
cool game,4
"I was able to play for awhile... WAS... Now it won't even load up. New Moto M2, so it should play... EA like normal will ignore. Don't know why I even try.  How not to run a business , by EA...",1
"Cool game, fun ta play.",4
I used to play the first one and the second one .if you like a four-minute downloading time to get into the game and a crash after that then this knock off is for you,1
This game is awesome and fun,5
Great game. Slap those imps!,5
"Love the game very similar to the old PC one..   Kinda expensive,  need to buy gems to continue playing.",4
Game is good but today upset me. I was on a 14 win streak and was winning my next battle when I received a call. I declined the call but lost my win streak and everything I also lost all my minions .need to fix it so at least you don't loose everything,3
Definitely isn't a speedy win game but a very good rebuild on a classic.,5
I've been playing this game for awhile now. All in all a solid game. Today when I was retaliating xal from mistress masters. His library singlehandedly decimated my army. Now having max level troops and a lev 13 horny shouldn't have a problem taking out the library. Especially when his rating is just over 3000 and I'm closer to 3500 this shouldn't have happened. Either this is a bug or a very bad hack. I can say your going to loose players if this crap keeps up.,2
Wait times are insane. .. up to 7-8 days. But game play is great.  It's one of those games you spend 5 -10 minutes on every few hours. I hate large in app purchases but if you have patience you can avoid those in this game.,4
"I wish games cared more about the user's entertainment level than the profit they can gain from making the game.  Games are suppose to be fun, not a) sit around for hours waiting for something to build/upgrade/charge/recover... and b) spend real money just to have all that stuff finish quicker so you can wait on something else...",1
"I love having the option to play a game that's only about being evil, but in a naughty way as opposed to like robbing old people. Though lately it either hasn't connected to the server or just crashed at startup... Please fix that.",3
I love how you guys combine a classic game with Farmville. It could be better but still great job,5
I love this game but recently it hasn't been connecting and it is really frustrating,5
"""Please wait while your imps get your dungeon in order."" For how long? How many times must this show before the game functions? I used to consider this game the best for tablet. Now it is obvious that it only exists to fill EA's pockets so they can fix and make other games to fill their pockets. I should demand a full refund for wasting my time.",1
Super fun good game :),5
Fun,5
Not as good as the original but still good,3
Best game ever,5
Pretty good game play with enough to do to keep you coming back.,4
Wow i loved this game!!! Notice the Past tense. Payong a little here or there on a game is one thing but after the changes with the update it just got beyond fair. Thanks for ruining a great game.,2
Fun game but takes a long time to level up w/ out spending,3
You can build your on dongen,5
"Every time I try and attack, it force closes in the middle of the attack.  That's not counting how many times it force closes when I start the app, or how many times it force closes while in my dungeon.  My point is, this game force closes often.  I'll be uninstalling soon, seeing as how the frustration is eating my mind.",2
"The computer games were tight, but this one does not resemble them. I think when the developers made this they were also in the process of making love to each other while cutting each others balls off and then reattaching them right after. Then this game came out!",1
"Not the original, but still a great time!",5
"One star app. Wait 7 days for a second star, or purchase it for 4.99$.",1
"Runs so smoothly, good game if your a fan of the original on pc",5
Fun game. Don't like waiting for upgrades after Purchasing.,4
Miss the game on PC,3
Awesome game ! Better than clash of clans in my opinion,5
I used to play this with my dad all the time when I was younger. Soooo glad they released a revitalizeation of it,5
You have to pay money I'm not.  Doing that hell no,5
Game has gotten better. Its bull though when the game crashes at the beginning of a fight and u then have no control of the fight. Needs to be a way to get back to your fight if the game crashes or something.,3
"Its fun at first, I liked the tournaments and making the dungeon stronger. Never spent $ for gems...but now I've built all my stuff I only get on to fight another dungeon every few days",4
Too much fun. Well done mobile app,5
Awesome game with lots of challenges and really does take a lot more than normal games but it's awesome,5
Great Fun!,5
I'm giving this app 1 star. Additional stars may be purchased for $4.99.,1
"But since it auto disconnects from the server at the server side after 5 min of inactivity and must then spend 30 seconds to reload , it`s annoying factor beats it`s fun.",2
Love it so addictive,5
"Cool game. It just moves to slow, takes to long to load.",4
":) others are right however, if you're a serious gamer you are going to be put off by the sheer greed of the developers.",4
Great game,5
Great Game,5
It is a cut above the rest,5
Love the game I used to play the  computer version,5
"A nice twist on clash-like games, people complain about the cost but really, it's not hard to wait, never used gems on anything but a new imp",5
"This game is pay 2 win. Unless you plan on spending but loads of money on speed and upgrades or have plentiful patience, this game will not be fun or fair. If anything, it makes shadow kingdom look good.",1
Good,5
Took a bit to get used to but I haven't stopped playing and do enjoy the game. The guilds feature adds a lot to it.,4
"Minion intelligence = idiotic at best. 54% win before time runs out doesn't = 50% loss when it does. CONSTANT UPDATES change game dynamic and play every other week. Test a game before release maybe, not release crap and fix as you go.",1
Yawn.,3
"Don't get me wrong, I love this game... when it works. The game crashes about every other battle, which causes me to lose everything  (win streak, soldiers, mana, trophies) when the game returns. It is extremely frustrating and makes it hard to keep interest in the game.",3
I love the style of the game! perfect,4
Awesome=e=eeeeeee=eeeeeeeeee=eeeeeeeeee eeeeeee eeeeeeeeee,5
"It is very fun,  I remember playing it on the pc . The only problem I have is you have to spend crystals do to anything that takes a long time.  I mean like the day to dig out a vein or upgrade",4
Based on past dungeon keeper games the same way the World War Z movie was based on the book.,2
Glitchy and not enough like the old game.  Also be prepared to spend real money or be emensley patient.,3
Then you will have a blast with this. Only thing I would change is I miss the hero being the one coming through the dungeon.,5
Sweet,5
Its a pretty neat game. But it says cannot access server alot. But fun when works and ea desperately needs to decrease wait times or give more options money free for more imps. After update I still get the cannot connect to server screen. Where I have been on several times. I don't get it. Its fun but that's getting annoying quick. I mean you gotta expect 100 cannot access servers for a handful of actual game loads. Its ridiculous I'm pretty much done playing till they fix it.,2
"I played the original on pc and, while this game isn't the same, it's a nice remake/update. So far, i haven't seen anything in the game that you can't get without paying money which is nice. I don't mind waiting a few days for something to finish upgrading because I actually have a life. I log in once or twice a day, clear some gold, do a raid or two, give my imps a slap, and get on with my life. Good job.",4
Having fun,4
Always crashing and loading. I can't even do a raid without getting kicked out. Same on all of my devices with strong WiFi.,1
"It would have been better to, rather than mess with the amount of time necessary to complete tasks, allow players alternatives to whipping out the card. I suppose that's the point, though. Expect a pay-or-uninstall roadblock in the first five minutes. That's how long I played this steaming pile of EA's latest round of top-notch let-downs. Go to goodoldgames and play something worth a thousand times more than whatever sum of money you slung into this retarded little brother of Dungeon Keeper.",1
This is effectively farmville in a dungeon with some very loose elements borrowed from the original dungeon keeper games. Not worth playing and by no means worth sinking real money into.,1
Have to pvp to upgrade dungeon heart... hating this game more now then ever. Bring back to gold upgrade option for the heart.,1
Fun like the original.,5
Fun to play,5
"Fun game. Similar to the originals, but an expensive app if you want to move things along quickly.",4
Quite the different style of play. Love it! There needs to be more games like this switching up the style of play. There are too many clash of clans..,5
"This game COULD be worth playing. Instead, some greedy idiots made that impossible without throwing all your money at it!",1
For being a classic PC game.... It has been ruined by micro transactions. It seems impossible to play it without feeling like EA expecting  to spend real money. You barely get any gems to play this game even digging any of the blocks.... Shame on you EA for ruining one of my favorite PC classic! üò≠,1
Great game,5
"It was confusing, time consuming and it downloaded a weird song onto my phone whithout my permission. 1/5 would not dungeon again",1
Getting better and better!,5
Fun,5
"This game is a viable definition for a remade game ruining its predecessors. The control system is a bit wacky, the graphics, while good, are far too cartoony to really fit the theme and feel of the Original.  Frankly, I agree strongly with the idea that E.A. ruins games. Between the changes and the money grubbing, you have virtually destroyed my memories of the PC classic. One star because zero isn't an option.",1
"Microtransactions you say? If paying to win is your thing then have I got a game for you. This could've been really great. The graphics are great and the vibe is dead on, but having to spend money to do anything is wrong in every way.",1
Ea is famous for they outstanding graphics and game play and they really delivered that in this game,5
Cant type name,1
This was an awesome PC game until the greed came and now it take 8 hours to clear rubble....,1
Awesome! !!!!!!! !,5
"I 've loved DK from #1 but this one is either going to cost a whole lot of money or it'll take you a year to lvl everything up to top lvls , whish gems were easier to get,  because after 4 DAYS I'm already to the point where I just pop in to build something every 12 hours ,but my love for DK2 will keep me playing",4
This game is so awesome im gonna explode,5
"I think it's very entertaining! I enjoy the challenge, as well as build it yourself style! Very unique. =)",5
This game is one of the worsted games like a cheap knock off of super cells Clash of clans I give it one star just because I can't give it a half a star,1
"Logged in to find that 700 gems i had mined from my dungeon had disappeared. I didnt spend them, i've not had anyone on my account... it took me weeks to mine those, and suddenly they're gone. Sorry EA but this issue is pretty big.",1
Great game!,5
Give me moar,5
"Buy the real one if you want to have fun, this is pay to win",1
"I like it so far... Has minions from original game ,its made for app users so the way you might play is diff now but idk its diff in a good way. Would recommend for strategy lovers... ;-)",5
"Pay to play, or work on your patience.  It's up to you. Take time to find a good guild.  You will find quality people, who enhance the experience. Hmmm, I wonder if EA has any marketing gigs available?  Haha! Join now, I need more minions to crush.   Addendum: will not except my birthday, in order to communicate with guild. Please fix. Thanks for fixing it. :-)",4
Ok for a brief time killer but not at all what I'd hoped for.,3
The only thing that I have a good idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to have,5
Great time killer!,5
Always updating.  Good game to pass time.,5
You train an evil army and you have imps and some mutch more! It is like Clash of clans but better!,5
"First- You need to be online to play. Second, you have to pay to play freely. Such a crap game, a shame for the creator of the original game...",1
I've been playing this game since I was little,5
"Not much like the original series anymore. Kinda fun but real slow. Hung up during update and now it just hangs on updating, even after reinstall. Glad I only spent 5 dollars.",3
I've been playing this game for a week or two and it's pretty alright. Playing on a note 3.,5
This game is fun if u dont mind long wait times for getting things accomplished and constant disconnecting from the server which results in an instant loss of the battle and all expended minions and mana.,3
Love this game,5
Recommend this game,5
"No real support on crash issues. Takes real money to play. You lose your gems, money, stone, minions effort repeatedly from constant crashes. Even with a brand new phone on a powerful connection I get error code 7 and loading screens in the middle of raids and upgrades and in turn lose everything. Support team basically said they would help me one time but I was on my own if it happened again. Well it happens every single time I play and from reading others reviews it happens to a lot of people.",1
But for a remake it's playable,4
Love this game just the characters and dark feel is awesome,5
"You can't restart this game.  One profile gets one dungeon.  If you crash or lose connection while you are attacking you are treated as if you just stopped on purpose, which is annoying. I did spend $10 to support, but you can play the entire game without paying(just have to wait more).  Very enjoyable and I have spent months playing,  but it is not that much like the original DK for PC.  In the beginning you can play nonstop, but as you advance then it becomes a game you log on to every couple of hours.",5
The new attack points before i can upgrade? Limiting gameplay  ruined it for me. Im done with it till thats gone.,2
Keeps crashing and giving me error code 7 already can't play gamesoft please fix other wise okay FYI I've got a dragon touch,2
I love this game,5
"Needs a better save feature as it sometimes kicks you off in the middle of a battle, and offline mode would be cool",4
"By upping the cost of rearming traps it's no longer worth it to do survival raids as half of your winnings go back into your traps and raids are NOWHERE near that much in coin so they fall below the bottom line. WTF??  And why aren't the ""special"" survival raids leveled?  The winnings are huge in the beginning but the more you level the less it helps.  You guys are slipping...",3
Doesn't require much time and gives me short breaks in my day. Love the sarcasm.,5
"This isn't dungeon keeper, its a pay for green gems or wait game that they applied dungeon keeper graphic theme to.",1
Great game,5
Virtually the same game but underground and with more voice acting. Almost fun but the wait or pay mechanic still ruins it for me.,2
Bored now. Deleting it . moving on,3
"So much like impire, love it!",4
It has its up and down with monster pathing. But has regular updates.,4
First,5
"Has gone down hill. Minions don't show up, immortals don't show up, raids get cut off at the start so you LOSE, yet mama gets taken away, missing gems, etc. All this paired with the INSANE wait times, its not worth it. BYE.",3
Only down fall is the addiction :/,5
Help I cant stop playing too fun XD,5
Why the f@#$ after every single update do I have to turn off notifications? Why does this game keep reseting to allow notifications?,1
Thank the dark Gods there is actually a Dungeon Keeper app!!,5
Loved it back in the day and love it now!,5
Great game!!,5
"This is a fine game to play in between the other EA games Google Play offers... Wait times are a bit long... In all, a great title...",5
"Since the last update, I have not been able to load the game.",1
Fun on a phone,5
"This game is a lot of fun, unfortunately EA had decided to be idiots and allow the ""Asian hackers"" to ruin the tournaments... Get off your a$$ EA and fix the game!!!  Is not like you dont have the resources",1
"Excellent design, great balance already, better than average giggles. A unique fusion of tower defence and guild wars type games. Needs better guild management to get rid of inactive leaders in established guilds.",5
Poor gameplay. Elements unbalanced. Hard to play. Great concept that was poorly executed imo .,1
Great way to kill a few minutes every day,3
Addictive but not for the quick junkies.,5
"great game,but the server will drop you for no reason, ending your raid, causing loss of all minions and magic used, and counting it as a defeat. i am unable to make it through a raid, and i have botched three exclusive raids, because the server drops me. both in mobile data, and on wifi...this is especially upsetting when you get to 9/10 on an exclusive raid and all of the sudden the imps feel the need to get everything in order.      LOOK, I GET IT, CONNECTIONS GET LOST, BUT PLEASE RESET RESOURCES!",3
"Its back and sucks!  4 TYPES OF CURRENCY really slows down the pace.  Gems, gold, stone, and mana are the currency.  I'd rather pay $5 to $10 for an open game. If you dont purchase anything you lose pace.  Attacks are too frequent from other players.  I'm about to delete now.  Other sims have a faster pace and you can defend yourself.",2
The game is fun and challenging.,5
"Staring at a ""checking for updates"" screen is not why I began playing this game. Im glad at this point, that I haven't paid money to feel LEFT OUT.. What happened?.. THERE IS NO DUNGEON KEEPER, just an app widget, and a ""checking for updates screen"" to stare at. No game at all.... too bad for you, I might have considered spending money on this!.. 2 stars because I LOVED THE GAME..... YOU CANT PLAY THIS GAME AT ALL ON A FREE WIFI CONNECTION... BS!!.. Im about to give up!!.. subscribers are leaving you??????",2
Fun game and a nice homage to the original PC game but the whole pay to play concept is too heavy handed and also just about everything takes an excessive amount of time to complete.,4
The game is great fun. However it glitches all the time during battle and kicks you out of battle. You lose all the minions you have used and have to resupply them. You also use your magic and have to wait for it to regenerate. You also get the added bonus of having it count as a loss. Fix this by refunding all minions and resources and not giving a loss and then it will be great.,3
Even more fun than the PC version,5
Great game,5
"This was the best game I had,but now after the 50th update the app is now too large to fit on my phone. Thanks for making it impossible for me to play, guess that's what I get for being a loyal player for 3 years. Big middle finger to you devs, hell let's make it both middle fingers.",1
Glitchy. Also they keep changing how the troops and spells work which is getting really old. It's made a lot of people stop playing.,3
"Great game that you can spend 5 minutes a day or multiple hours straight advancing, improving and reaping rewards for plundering gold from enemy keepers. Learn battle strategy and defend tactics by practicing and by watching how other keepers ransack your dungeon. ... learn from their mistakes..... revenge is sweet!",4
"Fun, entertaining, whimsical... great to play, easy GUI... definitely keeps me coming back hour after hour",5
I usually don't play dungeon games but this has to be one of the most funniest ones I've ever played,5
Downloaded this on a whim and I'm hooked.,5
Fun game but microtransations,4
This is a sucky game that will crash every chance it gets drain your device resources.,1
"""Package Access Helper has stopped"".   I can no longer open the game with the latest update.   Paranoid Android 4.45b1 with Franco kernel r58.   The game previously worked with this setup.",4
"I got this because I Loved the original. This has some of it's charm. I also don't seem to be able to hold a connection to their servers very well, and It's not on my end as far as I can tell.",4
Great game,5
Na,5
"I loved this game at first but now during almost every battle the game will freeze and throw me back to the loading screen. When the game finally resumes, all minions need to be re summoned and the battle is an automatic loss (even if I've only used a few minions to attack or just destroyed an enemy's dungeon heart). If this problem continues every time I try to attack, I will have to lower my rating to one star and just uninstall (which makes me thankful I hadn't decided to spend any money on gems yet).",2
Not bad for raping my childhood and leaving me with a pay to win game.,3
"It is always fun to replay a game from yester-year. 1 star only because the game requires real money to go very far, very quickly. Soon you'll be waiting around doing nothing. As a level 8 treasury takes 4 days to build! If you waste your gems to quicken to speed up build time you soon won't have any to get that 3rd imp.  The game wants $100+ to get anywhere soon.  This is not a game you can play.  You have to give it a new build command, quit, and then come back a day later, build command, quit.",1
I've been waiting for the return of dungeon keeper for years. This is not what I had expected it's an okay game for mobile.  There is a major bug with imps just disappearing. The gems like all games of this kind from EA cost way to much. Maybe EA should stick to making its boring repetitive sports games and give up on real games.   P.S.  the average rating is a lie. don't use the link in the game to leave your rating it is a trick you can only give it a high rating or otherwise be redirected to a website.,1
It's a good game if your into giving money to EA,1
"With recent updates and improvements, things are starting to get interesting. Two requests at this time, could you make a tutorial for players? Many players I have talked to do not know half the features or where things are. Example: why and how to upgrade guild levels, where to donate gold, or even how to donate minions. Granted I am not the best player here though, I should not have to be a tutorial/teacher either. Also, could you add an auto feature for guild minions- if you do not donate, you can not withdraw or you can not withdraw more than you have donated. Same idea for the guild perks if you do not donate to upgrade guild level then you do not get the perks. Something like that would be good. It shouldn't be left up to only a few to do it all while others reap all the benefits and do nothing.",4
Disconnect problems have been reduced. This have made the game more enjoyable. Long wait times require a lot of patience for upgrades. But much more real game experience than in clash of clans,4
"Once you've dug up everything there is to find, and you're just mining for days at a time for every upgrade, you should be able to send the minions to work the mines and increase their output. I've got one upgrade building and 5 minions sitting on their hands with nothing to do!",3
Boring. Repetitive. Restrictive. A blatant Clash of Clans clone capitalizing on the DK namesake,1
I played when I was young,4
"Way to kill a great series. I'll keep playing it for free just to spite EA. Shame really, I'm willing to pay $10 for a great mobile game.",1
It's the only game I play now. No need to spend money you can unlock everything in time. No ads best free to play out there.,5
Dungeon keepers,5
"Since the last update, game is unplayable. Completely crashes after a few minutes. Do not spend money on this game.",1
Totally worth the waiting,5
"I really enjoyed the game even though it constantly begged me to make in game purchases. But the difference between casual player and paying to play player is remarkable. Way to kill a great game with terrible, TERRIBLE money hungry tactics... They're are actually things you can never achieve without paying! And their rates ain't cheep!",3
It needs to have a global chat so we can get members in the clans,3
Used to crash a lot more than now. Think they fixed some bugs but make it worse sometimes and that gets pretty annoying. Wish they could have an option where you can manually lower the resolution for smoother game play. Not everyone cares about nothing but the best graphics all the time.,3
"Awesome game mechanics, clever development system, a worthy successor to the DK franchise. Could only get better with more offline features.",5
Wish it was more like the original.  But still fun,4
Fun game that takes time with a friendly lore and awsome online abilities,5
"The limits of the game are reached fairly soon,  then it switches to a limited set piece battle game.  The annoying part is that it will suddenly announce for the world to hear some meaningless announcement like your minions are ready to raid,  not cool if you are a professional in front of customers.",3
"Not a bad game at all, but one update and it wasn't compatible with my device anymore. Better luck this time I hope.",1
I've been playing four a couple weeks can't stop don't care about the long waits I'm so op it doesn't matter raid me I dare u molag bal,5
I played this on the computer when i was 18ish and its still fun now.,5
I just wish their was a faster way to gain the green stones. An a little bit faster to....,4
It's a fun game... but it could b way better,3
Are the Devils territory.,1
Really fun and its impossible to find a good game that actually works good....,5
I love this game,5
"I loved dungeon keeper on the PC, and this game does a fair imitation of it in a touch environment.  However the greediness of it's pay to win in app purchase system completely ruins it.  The cost of gems is ridiculously high, and if you don't have them you get to play for 5 or 10 minutes every 3 to 8 hours.  If it weren't for this pay to win system being in place this would probably be a fun game that I'd be willing to pay 20 or so dollars for up front.",1
"This game instantly got my favor with ""Horny"" and continued game play show this game is a lot more then just hilarious.",5
I agree that imps are too expensive when you consider how long projects take to complete.,4
Lots of gems at the start help me through some thought times,5
Keeps geeting better.,5
Not like the original but close and can't really get behind the free to play bs.  Great game if you're a true fan.,4
"Awesome, very addictive",5
"Boring, skip it and go to the REAL clash of clans",1
Just getting started. Played the original game years ago. Found it limited for the lack of multiplayer. The phone app looks to change that. I am hopefull that this will be as good as it looks so far,4
Great game,5
"Loving this game! I love the idea of the wallpaper, but it needs a feature to sit the sound off. It gets annoying when my pocket giggles. A couplej suggestions; make the imp slap - able and the bonus applied to the game. Also, for the wallpaper, have the imp go through the door and wander around the dungeon (with the camera following).    (UPDATE) The higher levels slow way down due to lack of appropriate gold and stone generation. Please patch!",5
Funny and easy to control,5
"This app looks like DK, sounds like DK, but plays like 500 other clones out there. Same economy, same building upgrades, everything. If you liked the real dungeon keeper, this will be a vast disappointment. Added: the survival raids have been letting me get to wave 7 before disconnecting me, which causes me to automatically fail, despite being on wi-fi with a strong connection. Lame.",1
Having a great time paying and working with my fellow guild members to accomplish goals.,5
Its good dept for how long it takes to mine... I mean 24 hours for 1 square is insane!!!!,4
Awesomeness!,5
Great game if your looking for a guild were almost lvl13 got a few very good members need more active people,4
"0 stars Too many permissions,  and need to be online!?!  Nothing like the original.   Monetizing the old game with none of the old game love.",1
This game reminds me of old times.  I played the original for hours.  Love it.  Just wish things got finished faster,5
"Castle defense meets sim city, with demons and minions. Runs smoothly, looks great, fun to play.",4
Dungeon Keeper definitely is a keeper!,4
"I enjoy playing,works great",5
Nothing built from eternal $payment$ gets 5 stars.,4
"A great adaptation of the original,  like the challenges to unlock creatures and traps.",5
Dungeon Keeper is a great series that must remerge!,5
Very cool new twist on one of my old school favorites,5
Imp work a little slow for the gem cost,4
"I've played the original PA games, and this makes a lovely addition to the series.",5
It's great and entertaining,5
New update.............a week and a half later still stuck on loading screen supposedly downloading update?? Hope it gets fixed soon.,3
The new update has really hurt this game,1
Cool game. I like this style of defense strategy game. Wouldd be 5 stars if the tasks took a little less time.,4
I missed this game,4
"A pitiful Clash of Clans clone. More timers than that game, too, which is impressive. Constantly begs you for money, to buy something. Any normal developer would be ashamed of themselves for this exploitive travesty.",1
"All of my childhood memories are being destroyed with games like this... At least it's still playable, albeit very slowly",2
Lose battles,1
"Every time I submit a bug report I get an email sorry to hear about that.  Yet things hardly ever get fixed.  Good game as long as you can live with the bugs they have claimed to have been fixed.  Minions will get stuck on zero second summing time remaining.  During play you get a star from destroying over 51% of the enemy's dungeon, but it is taken away at the end of battle.  Network disconnects counts as a loss.",4
"I'm always being dropped in the middle of a raid (4 weeks in a row for the survival raid) which results in automatic loss regardless of progress which in turn results in lost gold by way of lost minions, lost mana, and the over priced/undervalued kicker....  lots of lost gems, both used and earned. (By the way, the 6th imp's price should be considered a crime.) There really needs to be a way to keep the game playable through small hiccups to server connection. If the problem is resources, maybe DK should use less or require more for installation.",3
"24 hours to mine a square? That's not just slowing gameplay, that's not having gameplay at all.",1
"Main problem, I can't get past one raid or defence without dissconnecting.",2
Good game. Lots to do!,5
I appreciate that constant attempts at improvement.,4
Keeps losing connection when attacking.,3
Way too glitchy. Crashes often.,4
Game keeps popping up sceen. Says imps need to fix Dungeon. Please fix. Will rate higher,1
"You can progress in this game for free no matter what people say. But at some point whatever plans you've had you'll stop constantly winning other players. That happens at about 2000 trophy level. Once you stop winning, you stop making quick stone and gold, thus every building, trap, minion upgarde in the game becomes painfully slow. Like several weeks slow. You naturally start to loose interest and stop playing. Although I did spend $15 in the beginning to get extra couple of imps and to support the devs.",5
Yep sure is. Slap an imp and you'll see what I'm saying,5
I love this game!,5
Fun times !,4
Heall Yeaa,5
great,5
Based on the original PC game from way way back.. Its a very good mobile game.. A fee jitters here and there but overall a fantastic game to spend some time..  Recommend it to anyone who loves tower defense games and fantasy world scenarios.,5
Regular dungeon fighting game.,5
Poor interface design. Couldn't skip tutorial. Couldn't change app / volume settings until the end of the tutorial. Frustrated me so much I uninstalled.,1
I've seen this game being played for over a year a D finally wanted to give it a try it was better than I thought,5
"I was casa Diablo ,clan leader of bahamut guild.  Then my iPhone was battery corroded so replacement phone is this android. I had level 10: heart, hatcheries, library, training room and level 5 or7  of graveyard and ghosts. Now I have to start all over? Please help",5
Update: can't think of a game I've stuck with for so long. You don't HAVE to spend money to have fun with it. Just takes longer if you don't. They is ALWAYS something in the game that needs to be upgraded so there is always another goal to work toward. Fun for the long run :-),5
Love this game!,5
"Its fun,  but needs an increase of gem recollection",4
Bo-ring,2
Very Addicting. Reminds me of the old PC version.,5
I've been hooked for months! You get beat your worker imps so they work harder...So you can summon a varied and wide array of monsters to raid the ill prepared keepers and pilfer there resources...Lead by powerful immortals your troops destroy your enemies and bring you the spoils...Join an alliance...You get the idea...TRY IT!! I BET YOU CAN'T PLAY JUST ONCE,5
Reminds me of the old pc game,5
"Good tutorials, strategy involved, very fun and addictive, but spaced out enough to keep you from playing all night and dragging at work the next day!",5
sweet,5
Couldn't be better!!!!,5
Lots of fun,5
Better than most I've played and great graphics as well. Lol love the voices,5
It keeps getting stuck on a black screen and won't load on my ZTE Valet.,1
I enjoyed it,5
"As a fan of the older Dungeon Keeper games, I felt that this mobile ""sequel"" just doesn't do it justice. It's more of a ""who can buy the most gems to get over powered"" game rather than a real strategy title. Makes me sad. I wanted to like it.",1
Can't connect to server,1
I can't give you a description only because the tutorial won't go all the way through once I've reached the point where I'm supposed to summon another minion or something like that that s*** I tap my phone all over the place and nothing is happening please work on it and I'll rated different next seems like a really good game I tell you what I love the demon voice you guys know where to reach me let me know when you update,4
"Was fine until last update, and changed the update requirements.",1
Not the same as the original but good so far.,5
Please wait while your imps get the dungeon in order. ...crash during raids = low rating.,2
"I have been playing for a few years and for the past few months I have been unable to attack anyone, do the campaign or the weekly defense. Always gives message please wait while we get your umps in order after about 20 seconds",1
"If you like building things, and then tearing up the things that other people built, then this is your game. I've been playing this longer than anything else on my tablet, and I'm still having fun with it. Please keep the updates coming, the last one was great! I hope in future to see bigger dungeons, more traps, a lot more reinforced walls, and the ability to keep growing my army. I've topped out my traps, my floor space, and my hatcheries!",5
Amazing game,5
"Game is awesome, or it was until this stupid glitch that makes the trolls stand in the same spot trying to break a trap that isn't there. I would greatly appreciate it if you could fix that.",4
"I tis really easy to lose conection to the Internet,  and this game is based on that, I have lost many many points and battles because of that, at the middle of the battle I lose conection and it counts as you gave up. EA you sould do something regard to that",1
"With the latest update, at my rate of play, it's going to literally (yes actually literally) take me half a year to get the next upgrade to my dungeon heart. And that's not even the final upgrade.",1
"Game itself is 5/5, but the gems are very overpriced and the game is super slow without them. As a $10 game its just so-so.",3
"A Keeper's life is fun, devilish, brutal, silly, cartoony...did I mention fun? It throws you into the life of a Keeper and you hit the ground running. Horny knows best during the Tutorial; after that, save your Gems. You never have enough...and Imps, get them when you can. The more the merrier. Your success relies as much on your Raid prep as on your Raid execution. Many Minions to choose from, each with their own abilities make customizing your play style a joy. Defend well, attack intelligently.",5
I can't finish a raid cause it always kicks me and when I do beat them I go to my recent games and it says I lost,1
After I got through the tutorial and it freezing my screen I found it's a very limited version of the origional Dungeon Keeper. In game costs are way too pricey. Sad it's always about the money. Free premium advertised for google play birthday but never could figure out how to get it. I'll play a little while and delete it. Too bad. Game got slow. It's you build you dungeon then it's a battle card game except it's animated. I have deleted it.,1
With patience you can get everything without spending money,5
Simply put EA the cost of the stuff in this game is way wrong it's just not even close to what it should be and it takes forever this is a game I want to play but this cap takes forever and a day and I do mean a day I mean seriously EA on day to mine something or build something um let's make this more like the old and stop being Greedy you already make a ton our other games and the game people want to enjoy oh wait let's make you pay all this doe eh no. How about NO,4
"The August update ruined the fun of this game.  Sure it was overtly money-grubbing before but now it's also just not as fun and playable as it used to be.  Was already two stars for as bad as it was, dropping to an incredibly bad one star now.  DISLIKE!  :(",1
AWESOME,5
Need more gems for wait time.,4
Great fun,3
I would rate this higher if I could give my mops a to-do list. Game drags too much with the 12 hour waiting times.,3
"Has free weekly dungeons, but has crashed  on the final wave 4 weeks in a row.",1
You create your own personal horde to defeat real players or even play the games campaign. Its a really fun game and its a fun way to pass the time.,5
"This is another if those games where you either wait, wait, wait, or shell out money over and over. Honestly, I'd pay a PC game price for a portable version of DK. It's the nickel and dime you to death model that sucks.",3
"Too expensive, and conveniently lagged out on a 34 win streak. Weird zoom glitch after using the cluck off spell messed up another raid. Get your sht together.",2
Great game,5
Cool game,4
fun game,5
Its good but to much money wasting,4
"The game use to be fun but the loading time now is ridiculous. Takes up to 5 mins sometimes just to load the opening screen, then it takes up to a full min just to search a target. I'm on a 35mb cable connection playing on an Asus transformer pad tf700 so its neither my internet or my device. To top it off i use to see the figures running around for combat and now i only see heads. Fix the issues and ill change my rating.",2
Brings back memories,5
"Great game! Sweet graphics, fun gameplay, and spectacular co-op play!",5
Best game ever,5
"Awesome game, need more gems tho, and less construction times",5
Lots of fun,5
Addictive,5
"For an ea mobile game it's ok. If you're looking for anything like the original, forget it. Some things are ridiculous, like The Gem veins take 4 hours to clear! Raids are stupid & boring. Not worth spending money on.",3
With how long some things take the imps should cost less gems. Or you should get more gems from mining your own dungeon.,4
Fun game with loads to do!!!,4
They want u to play this game for ever ad u won't finish it. No thanks,1
Only issue is the amount of time it takes to get anything done,4
This was a great pc game back in the day. Unfortunately it has been ruined by terrible programming. In app purchases charge your account and do not give you anything!,1
You can play dungeon keeper without a phone! just sit in a chair and stare at the wall. Its the same thing as playing this game,1
Addicting,5
I remember this game on Windows 95 years ago.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Good humor.  5/5 for me.,5
For the last month or so I haven't been able to get past the update screen. I've had it sit over overnight and nothing. Its not frozen it just won't load. I'm losing so much time on my dungeon....help,1
"It was fun for a while but got boring quickly. You just do the same thing everyday with the construction and training timers lasting a whole week. Basically, after a while you can only do stuff about once or twice a week.",2
Seems pretty good so far. I enjoy slapping the imps,4
Fun!,5
Great game! Works great and perfect for letting off steam after work. Great defensive game!,5
It's quite entertaining but the downside is the building time and the amount of time it takes to remove blocks it's just way too high and I hope you guys tone it down a little...,5
Its pretty cool,5
Passes time very fast,5
Very entertaining.,4
Stradegy,5
Looked for it everywhere and found it always loved it,5
Love it,5
I haven't played it for long but it seems like a good game.,4
You have ruined a beloved game from my childhood. This game is just another attempt get more money. I will never purchase another game from EA.,1
"Recently the upgrade causes it to consistently restart in the middle of a pvp battle or upgrade, which makes playing it very inconvenient",3
I keep getting disconnected which ends my raids. Super annoying! Why can't it just update when it reconnected instead of requiring internet 100% of the time? Otherwise it is entertaining.,3
Developers keep changing the game.,5
Awesome,5
"With a few minor tweaks, like in app purchases, it holds true to the original. Well done in that it doesn't screw up the original, as many games do jumping to modern platforms.",5
"While the time it takes to upgrade and do anything is long...I don't really mind, honestly",4
"Cheap attempt by EA's part to grab a quick buck, it's a disgrace to DG, and DG 2.",1
"A fun game, but you have to have internet access to play.",4
Love the game however they need to fix the bugs that effect gameplay. Losing a few % off a victory means a loss. Units wandering off in different directions a etc.  I would give it a 5 if they fixed the bugs.,4
Its an ok game,3
Great game. Always has been,5
Love it,5
A great dungeon management game that let's you make traps and lead the forces of evil.,5
Like building,5
Nailed it!! Love ea for this awesome app!,5
"Remind me of an old fb game i used to play(dungeon overlord?). You build traps and summon trolls,minions,orgre and etc to defend your dungeon. Of course you can also show a demonstration of your power and raid other people's dungeon as well!",5
Still somewhat glitchy still hardly anything like the PC version. All dig times need to be cut in half if not more and imps need to cost less. I still think it is sort of a money grab by EA and I know I would have been happier to pay for the app and have no in app purchases. Need to change the fact that dungeon heart upgrade needs combat points. EA just needs to keep on working on making it better.,3
I would rate 5 but you need to use gem on everything please fix,4
you.,5
This is not a free game. Advancement is deliberately cryptic so that you will buy stuff direct from their item shop out of frustration. Do not expect to be able to advance without paying.,1
Bring money lol,5
I enjoyed playing it for a long while but now whenever i go to the main screen it freezes and i'm not allowed to enter please fix,1
Not sure why but I keep getting a loading screen in the middle of my games.  I can't attack other players now because it kicks me out after I start my attack. Just the minions getting my dungeon in order over and over and it doesn't matter if I am on wifi or network,3
Unfortunately it now crashes like a drunken go kart driver on a merry-go-round. Its impossible to improve your rating in game due to battles timing out and dc'ing as soon as you drop your minions in. Overall worthless now :( RIP in pieces DK.,1
Real fun but the gems are expensive,4
Take your time and you don't need to spend money.,5
Its fun but freezes often,4
Disconnected during PvP battles way to often and always fails to reconnect.,2
Would be better if u could have more floors n such.,2
I like it. Just wish I could have more minions.,4
Played this along with Clash of Clans. I am enjoying DK much more,5
Great graphics fun love all the ad on the Live wallpaper and the silly ring tone so stupid it makes you giggle and say that Horny is off the chain. Thanks EA,3
"This game is frustrating as hell! It requires a network connection to play, and frequently disconnects right in the middle of a battle, which you then lose. It takes days and over a week to upgrade anything.",1
It's fun for awhile until it kicks you out of matches or your in the middle of a fight,2
Love this game,5
Updates killed game. I easily spent over a hundred dollars building my dungeon just so they could change the game and make it useless. Uninstalling. No more EA games. Lesson learned.,1
Its a slow game. Takes a while to build up your dungeon without paying. But once you get into it its pretty fun wrecking other peoples dungeons while building up your own dungeon defenses. Not five stars because i really wanted it to be like the old dk.,4
Fun,2
I have been playing this game for a while now and enjoyed the older version.. since the update load time sucks... Thinking of deleting...,2
A solid time sink that's very forgiving of a casual play style.,5
Don't have to spend real money and can still win alot. I've been playing for months and it's still great. Build your guild lair and join THE IMMORTAL DUNGEON MASTERS. All caps. Great casual guild that can help you dominate. See you in-game!,5
"Awesome, entertaining and fun to play.",5
"Very fun! Same idea as clash of clans, but with the feel of Dungeon Keeper! Has long wait times but it's to be expected with a free to play time based game. Can make micro transactions to speed up the process of mining and building, or you can just wait. Guild interface seems kinda lunky, but they have time to fix everything. Great game overall, and with very few bugs! I see a long and promising future! God job EA!",4
"Nice game :)   the time on upgrading items and rooms are too long , but everything else is great :)",5
It's not as great as the pc version but it's adapted well.,4
There are always drastic change being made to the game.,2
Very well polished game!!,5
"Last update sucks it changed a lot of the game play, don't find it no where near as entertaining  as it was before the update .",2
"DEFINITELY DO NOT SPEND MONEY! A game that starts out simple and fun turns to an unbearably slow experience of ""wait several days for one timer before you can do anything else.",1
"I was excited to see DK for the phone after playing the originals from the 90's but then I saw what this was about. It takes too long to level up your minions, drains the battery from my phone, how many hours to build a room and the length of time that it takes to build things up removes the fun from the game. The aspect is captured from the original game by having the same minions and rooms and I'm a fan of the original DK games is the only reason that I give it 3 stars.",3
Is one of the best game I have ever play. Love it,5
Yet another fun game to kill all my free time!,5
Better,3
"Played this game a long time ago, started playing it today and I'm amazed @ how much fun it still is. Gonna look into part ii of it, I seen that it's out there, just haven't checked out yet any reviews on it. Hope ya enjoy it as much as I currently am.",5
Challenges keep you on point with all the Lil tricks & tips for growing a masterful dungeon. .!! Rly fun & love the free ringtone! ! ;),5
Please add support for immersive mode on KitKat devices.,4
"I really wanted to like this game, sadly the in app purchases have made it unbearable.",1
Update broke it.  Stuck checking for updates,1
I love it it's super cute! !,5
Game reminds me of the original game on PC way back I enjoyed it then and Im enjoying it now thanks very much.,5
What does this game sever run on? A toaster ?,1
"I played the original years back. So this is like a small next gen mario but with ""Horny"". ;)",5
Its so fun even if it has bugs just install it when you read this,5
"EA = Scum sucking greedwhores.  One giant, GIANT IAP.",1
Pretty good. I like the twist that you are the bad guy. Its like clash of clans on steroids,5
Fun and hours of fun,4
Update #2 August 18 2014 Stop updating trolls as soon as you change the trolls priorities it changes the game play.  Update 1: One minute they're attacking everything next minute they're running tangents to attack traps and not attacking immediate rooms!,1
Loads of fun,4
System crashes conveniently constantly during battles. Gem costs are ridiculous.  Other glitches occur too often as well...,3
"Used to love it when people would attack me. Now its a one way game, I have spent quite a bit of money on this game. No one ever attacks me now so I wont play anymore. So thanks for nothing!",1
Loved the Dungeon Keeper series and this feels like I'm playing it all over again.,5
"Awesome game, have to wait to much to upgrade. Good job.",4
I need help with My game..was doing Great and then got the up data and have not been able to play the game..It gets stuck on looking for up date...and Not loading the game..even tried taking it off and putting it back on..but nothing seams to work..Even tried turning my phone off and on..Can't get it to work..Greatest game ever but can't get it back..nothing..nothing..works..someone..HELP..HELP..,5
Was progressing in the game until the update. Now I cannot upgrade most of dungeon because of dungeon heart being stuck at lvl 7 and cannot obtain nowhere near the required combat points for lvl 8.,2
Loved it,5
"Download it, it's worth it",5
I use to play this game on the pc back in the day it is so much fun to play it again!,5
Spells having to be certain levels to disable trap? Really enjoyed it before this latest update now not sure if it's worth my time...,2
"I am a huge fan of the original Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper game. I still play it from time to time. This game was a little weird at first because I was so die hard over the original. Here is how I have come to see it, there is your favorite movie, and there is a pinball version game of it. Its different but its based of what what you are used to so a few quarters into it, it becomes aparent how good and fun it can be. I am impressed with the strategy involved due to the fact that your online vs real people!",5
A must play for all who are into defense games with whimsical twists :D,5
Congratulations on turning a decent game into a pile of junk with your new upgrades. It was already near impossible to get a star on a dungeon the way it was and now it's impossible. Thanks. Won't play again,1
Just started but so far I like it. Seems more involved than CLash,4
They said they give u a free imp if you buy gems; I bought 5 dollars worth...twice...and I still didn't get a free imp....not cool :/,1
great game,5

Dungeon names can get very offensive. #they're dungeons,4
I'm a noob but I love this game,5
I'm getting angry with this app in the middle of a raid it says loading and I get defeated plz fix I've spent money on this game.,5
Well it just dropped me back in my dungeon while in the middle of an attack lost all my men and I was going to win not even a refund of gold for the men I lost well I made it 20 mins in hopefully this issue is adressed,5
"If all you want to do is play 15-30 minutes a day, or spend alot of real money, then this is your game.  If you want true depth and good game mechanics, go else where.",2
"Entertaining- but makes you want to keep buying extras. Gems are addictive to buy as you grow your dungeon.  I once dropped $40 in one day's play. Ugh. (To self: ""Bad choice"")",4
"Game use to be fun,  but in the last week or two I'm constantly kicked out of the dungeon and get the pop-up that my Imps are preparing my dungeon.  The message appears ever few minutes regardless of  what I'm doing; working on my dungeon or trying to raid another dungeon. The pop-up has become so frequent that it makes the game practly unusable.  Issue appears on my phone or tablet and occurs regardless if I'm using wifi or the cell phone network.",5
Game is fun to a point. The real problem comes in with the massive amounts of gems needed to complete even the most menial of tasks...Pay2Win,1
"Not too complicated,  or too simple.  Very addictive!  No need to spend money if you're patient,  and not too expensive unless you want it to be.",4
"Not quite as good as the original, but not a bad game either.",4
"He us constantly wanting to slap the imps, but he accidentally speeds up what they are doing. I would have had enough for my next imp AND tiny if it wasn't so easy to access the gems...",5
Would be 5stars but the in-game store is crazy expensive,4
This suck,1
Loved it till update. Error 919 but I do not use WiFi....?,1
"The monetary system and purposeful but unnecessary time delay are an attempt to force people to pay to be competitive. Its tantamount to extortion, if you really want to play more than casually.",2
"Fun have to play,  wait time isn't bad. You can make in-app purchases but there isn't really any need to because you can get gems by digging.",5
Fun strategy game with endless ways to design ur dungeon..hopeFully they add some upgrades soon tho,4
Game of the year for me and it's to kill for.,5
"I had this game but  now i,I'm going to be better",5
Awesome game!,5
Once you're up and running the time it takes can be excessive. Past that not bad,4
Really fun game and easy playability,5
only thing i do not like is i get attacked by a high trophy count keeper. so no way to win against him. timing is ok like any other game. earning gems is fairly easy. good so far.,4
Awesomeness,5
"I use dungeon keeper daily and I am never bored or tired of getting on the game is fun and addictive,  great game",5
This game takes so much stuff up but I still love this game,5
Making this game worse. Combat poin for dungeon heart upgrades. I am done...,1
Watch,5
Loads of fun wait times kill me and I never did get that free I'm with my first gem purchase,5
It may be tedious at times but with the friends its a great game.,5
"I'm an old DK fan, and I'm impressed with how this game turned out. The one thing that drives me nuts is all the prompts for micro-transactions.",4
"Great defend game, takes a bunch to load at the beginning but it makes the waiting worth it. Liked a bunch.",5
An excellent nostalgia trip - a must have android game! Also a pay to play wallet eater.,1
I enjoy this type of game. Though I dont want to spend money on things that I really dont need. I dont mind the wait. I have plenty of thigs to do in my life. So I hit it up do what I need amd come back the next day. Not such a big bother like others say. Sure some things do take time but hell. Wjen you've got a life why does it matter how long a game takes.,5
,4
"Played this game before my first run in with puberty, more trickware from a greedy corporation exploiting up and coming game developers... what do they want us to do? Play, sleep repeat? No bang for your buck in your purchases. 7.99 for your first imp... and upgrades cost waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much. Zero punctuation had it right, America may not have a currency equal to Pounds Sterling, greed is all over this game.",1
So far a fun game,3
You have to invest hours of your time to upgrade your dungeon then deal with degrading changes by the site but overall ok app to play.,3
I can't even start the game because its says error code 6 and I keep trying but I can't get in.,3
Love it,5
Its not exactly like the original but I like it,5
Old sckool fun!,5
"While in your guild settings, attempt to chat. You are prompted for age. After entering age &gt;21, hit submit. Window closes. Attempt to chat again. Same cycle repeats infinitely. Please fix this annoying issue, and I'll happily change this to 5 stars! Thank you üòùüòÄ üêõüêú üòÇ",5
Absolutely I love,5
I was expecting an actual dungeon crawler and I get another typical freemium. The complete dependence on network often ruins it for me. Wait times are ridiculous too.,2
"Fun, but like the rest of them, will bore quickly when wait times skyrocket.",3
Not even touching this one. Just played to see how bad it was with the time and microtransactions.,1
"Game keeps crashing. Four times today alone. Frustrating as it causes you to lose the battle and any accrued bonus points. *edit* post patch the game randomly reloads. This costs you a win, accrued points and any immortals. Just lost a win streak and bonus because of it.",1
awesome game,5
samsung tab3,1
Very fun to play.,4
"My love will fade as with all things. Do I think I will love this game for 50 years? Probably not, however... All the sex lost from a successful defense is negated by having had a son. You will rarely convince a pretty girl that you are worthy because of this. Still, it is fun, and I cannot wait to defend my dungeon from the likes of YOU! COME STRONG, OR STAY AT HOME!",5
Good game,5
People wishing for a sequel will feel rotten after this.. Play the kickstarter sequel war for the overworld instead!,1
Can't stay connected long enough to accomplish anything.  Please fix. It's been a problem for several weeks.  Galaxy Tab 2,1
Yet another reason why I love epic games. Must have for any epic fan,5
Ruined a old classic game by making it a clash of clans rip,1
I downloaded it because it looked like a cross between D&D and clash of clans. Pretty fun so far!,4
Overall a good game despite the fact that the Challenges are frustrating at times because of upgrading.,5
Funnnnnnn,5
I found this game addictive and fun .,5
Great fun. Spend as little or as much as you like and still derive enjoyment.,1
It sucks 24 hours for a piese of land,1
I couldn't even get twenty minutes in before it crashed. Repeatedly. Always right after I build my treasury. I like it but I can't deal with it crashing and starting me five minutes back over and over.,2
Fantastic!,5
Fun game,5
Really addicting game download right now,5
Fantastic.,5
Love this game but I have serious issue w game loading while I'm playing on my Motorola Razer about ready to quit because of it... Hope it gets fixed soon please fix this loading issue it boots me from attacks and during test and very hard to attack when it is loading and backs you out to your home screen all the time,2
"So this mobile ver. Is pretty good, for a mobile version. However, 4 hr wait for gem vine... Bad    constantly freezing on Droid Maxx.....bad.     Laggish achievement pop ups....  BAD",3
If you can build a dungeon this is your game,5
"Now it won't even start. Stuck at checking for updates. Just as well since it seems the update brought a lot of unwanted changes.. Also the game is nothing like the original DK. Uninstalled, no great loss.",1
"Used to play this back in the day on PC 1 and 2. Now it's in my pocket!  "" you must build a layar for your creatures""!",4
Crashes on launch,3
Freakin Funny an plenty of entertainment i really like it maybe a few more updates to fix minor things here and there but i really like it.,4
Great all around app but I wish there was the ability to get a second dungeon or  make the one dungeon bigger. Also I do not like when the game drops it automatically makes you lose,4
Great game,5
"Fix game, was a 5 star but after update it will not open. Fix or Uninstall,  been days now since last update Uninstall today socks was a fun game",1
All my work for noting ... Un installed,1
The connection issues were never fixed. Had to delete. Its a shame too.....,1
The update ruined the game,2
Constant disconnections render the game almost unplayable.,2
This game is plagued with play-to-win tactics and even worse: Ea treats its costumers like walking wallets. I officially am sick of greedy game companies that desire to pressure me into spending thousands of bucks on stupid energy and gems. Developers like Ea and Gamevil make great games where players put little skill but more money into each game they play. The app store has too many abusive in app purchase. I'm fine with in app purchases; but I am done with Ea's greedy tactics I am done playing this game.,1
Just an all around addictive game,5
Great game if you loved the pc version,5
Just an all around fun and solid game.!,5
That was all I have to say.,3
It's a good game.,4
Awesome,5
Cool,5
This game constantly cuts out and I constantly lose all of my stuff.  I do love this game when I can play it.  Fix the issues and i'd give it 5 stars.,3
New update for one just stole real money from me. Wtf. Also its a very poorly structured ui that is clunky and half assed at best.,2
your games r cool I love this one but the grafics are glitching like black and white,4
"The game itself is fun. Good graphics/animations, fun gameplay, and fairly well designed. The part that takes away 3 stars is because EA wants to do everything they can to get people to drop hundreds of dollars. Massive wait times (over 2 weeks for some building upgrades) which would be fine if the upgrades didn't add an almost unnoticeable improvement.",2
"Quite a bit of fun, but need ways to earn gems.  Some nice upgrades this summer",5
"Completely changed the game...for the worse. All units act like lazy idiots now. Instead of digging through 1 block I'll just walk around and get knocked out says Digger. Good work...and what do you know, leave a bad review and I can't even get in the game any longer....EA",1
It is fun but keeps crashing,3
I enjoyed game until it kept disconnecting making it unplayable.  Ill wait for a patch and if not fixed in a month uninstalling,1
"It says""checking for updates"" then wont do anything else",1
Very awesome game,5
Completely hamstrung by a paywall,1
the dialogues are too long,1
"EA you wonder why you were voted worst company last year and this definitely hurt your reputation. This is worse than clash of clans, and that's saying something...",1
Alot of fun if u wanna spend a little cash if u don't then don't get or if your really patient its okay too,5
It seems to look like a 4 star app at first but when played it is.....well I guess it's okay,4
I remember playing this so long ago. Awesome that it's back!,5
"Pretty fun, too much of that wait time stuff they like to do nowadays, but still quite entertaining. Listening to the overlord guy taunt you for mistakes is pretty hilarious.",3
Great game!,5
"The game paled in comparison to the namesake classic, but was good for passing a bit of time. The most recent forced update won't load on my phone anymore, it just sits at the ea / mythic logo page forever.",1
"Great remake of the old dungeon keeper series. Micro transaction geared game play slows it down which is unfortunate. Rating a 1 because the last update causes the app to crash on startup. Ea, learn to test code",1
"Constantly,  the game is simply not playable",1
Was really fun but after last updated. Terrible now! Don't waste your time. No fun thx for nothing EA!!!!!,1
"I played the PC game many hours and loved it. I can't stand the new pay or wait mobile trend. If you want to wait a whole day or more to play your game again or pay ridiculous amounts of money to play, then this game is for you!",2
Crashed at lot on me but fun,4
But for real everything is useless or in the way now. Very displeased. Sorry but alot of people agree so I guess it had a good run.,1
Great game port by EA.  Wish we could enter into the bodies of our minions. Other than that I have had no glitches. Do dislike the constant prompt to link my account to the game once I've said no but that's not unique to this game...,4
"Lots of fun like the original, but too many pushes to make purchases",5
"Gems or no gems, thank the devil for this one!",5
"Well EA, it was a great game untill you went and ruined it with last update, you will see just how badly you did when you see all the players jumping ship.  Good job.",1
"So far so good, much like the original twisted to fit freemium style gaming. Worth a look if you are a fan of the original franchise. That's what I used to say about the game, and yes I lived through the other updates with whinging of course, but Update 4 takes the cake. You have taken what was a decent game and ruined it, in an effort to increase revenues through in game purchases. When you're doing your postmortem on what went wrong, start with, we we're greedy Capitalist pigs who had no clear vision.",2
Its a great game got a few bug but still fun,4
"But then they updated it and I lost time and resources invested. 3 days into updating my warehouse and treasury... Gone! Must be because I put time and not money into it, right?",1
Crashes at load screen. Recent changes have been bad as well.,2
Well designed good work ea.,5
The app is huge and takes up a huge chunk of memory while playing. Slows down on my older device. Not worth my time to keep playing if it is going to be sluggish.,3
Great graphics and gameplay,5
"Not enough like the original to be be considered a successor to Dungeon Keeper. But as a casual farm game, the graphics, dark yet humorous tone, and other similarities to the PC game are awesome.",4
"Was about 2-3 days away from having enough resources to up my dungeon heart to level 10 when the latest update changes the ""necessary"" currency to ""battle points"" (wtf?!?!)  Completely killed my interest in the game by being SOOO close to a major milestone only to have it yanked away.",1
Realy fun game,5
Time to break blocks is too long and the update makes the game less enjoyable .,3
"I had hopes for this game, but EA has had the ability revoked to market this as a free game because of how prohibitive it is to have any form of success without buying gems.  Would rate 0/5 if I were able to.",1
I don't care that people say it's bad it's good don't trust them....,5
"Yes, this is an angry rant.... But still. Approximately 6/10 battles will be disconnected in the middle at my loss, which is ridiculous, whether i am on my Android or ipod, wifi or 4g. As well, spending gems mid battle to get mana just for it to lag and cancel a spell, still costing mana, would this not technically be thievery? Forcing the loss of gems, which cost real money..... Still",1
Whoever upgraded the last patch and overhauled the monetary system for upgrading dungeon hearts gave no notice to the players in game. Lousy job guys :(,1
"I wish I could rate it with 0 stars, before update the app would notify me of things with a simple tone, now it talks over whatever I'm doing on my phone. So if I'm using my device as a music source at a function, if I forget to turn off notifications I get an annoyingly loud ""Your imps seek attention!"" Or something to that effect. Also now after update, Tiny the immortal has become completely useless, he targets every minion that moves in his vicinity and ignores the orders to attack rooms, lame",1
Fun app to play and you can actually get very far on the free version which is great.,5
The game is not the game I started playing in February 2014 I am almost to the point of trying to get a refund.,3
"Update: ""package access helper has stopped,"" I cannot play. Gem price point way too high, spams for 5 star reviews. Perfectly good game ruined by EA business model. These aren't micro transactions, they're full transactions with micro benefits.",1
"After the most recent update I can no longer motivate my imps. Going to the imp screen now throws the game into an endless loop and I must end the app and start again. Also, when raiding the mentor will tell you things like ""Your dungeon heart is under attack"" when it isn't even your dungeon heart! This is otherwise a great game an I hope these issues can be fixed soon!",2
"Now that you use combat points as currency and require a higher dungeon level to mine hard gem veins, it becomes almost impossible to level up. You have to engage in combat with other keepers, but you have no level matching. Every time I try to combat an opponent I get my butt kicked because they are a much higher level. Therefore I lose combat points.  Also, if I have to ""win"" challenges just to get minions then why am I paying for the challenge. Or for the room for them to spawn from. Fix or I delete game",2
"Before the recent updates, I had given this app 5 stars and recommended it to everyone I knew . EA completely destroyed a fantastic app. Small surprise given their track record. Time to uninstall what had been a great game.",1
Always crashes after the update... Please fix,1
Game quits in middle of attacks causing you to lose the battle.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  Recent update? How about fixing the BUGS instead trying to make improvements. IT STILL QUITS WHILE TRYING TO PLAY.,1
For those who like tactics games,5
I get the preceding error after updating from play store and then in game update does not download,1
I like very much,5
Was better before last update. EA sucks!,1
At higher levels game is much more fun. Current connection issues prevent a higher rating,5
Love the game but just wish we had an easier way to alter the dungeon layout or remove the rooms,5
"After a couple of days of ""playing"" which was mostly waiting - its obvious the goal of the game is to steer you HEAVILY into IAP ( real money for ""gems"" ). Uninstalled - and moving onto War for the Overworld",1
Should have never been pushed out until a new full team was in place. Not a single change improves the game in any way. Mythic was closed for a reason. Letting the remnants of their staff unleash their incompetence on the game 1 last time was a terrible decision.,2
I just did the most recent update for this game and now i cant do anything in my dungeon it repeatedly reloads and says my imps are getting my dungeon in order. As soon as it come back to my dungeon it does it again. And again and again. Please fix. I enjoy playing this game,2
"With the latest update, this game just became amazing. And the people complaining about micro-transactions just know most games have them and I'd say this game is much better then the others even if there prices are pretty steep. Still, great job EA! This is the only game of this type that I haven't uninstalled after 6 months. And that's pretty good for me. Another great update! Now I will have a much better chance to survive attacks.",5
No longer works after last update. Update package force closes everytime I attempt to play...,1
After the update the game constantly disconnects - every minute or two. It is now unplayable. I have put lots of money into this game with in-app purchases (you have to pay to be competitive) and now I can't even play it. EA support is completely nonexistent - there's no one to talk to about it to fix it or get money back.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME - IT'S A RIPOFF!!!,1
I needed a screen tapping time waster now that the Simpsons Tapped Out has become unplayable on my phone and this game is it! Very cool game and it gives me something to do in the bathroom at work. Gotta go collect some more gold and stone! :-),5
"I couldn't believe it when I saw this on the front page of the play store. I used to play DK2 all the time, and it seems they did it justice on the mobile version. One my favorite PC games has come back to life.",5
"While not the original it was a decent game to play. But why would you add a 4th currency,  scrap a decent ui, and change a majority of the stats for the whole game? It's like the devloper wants players to quit the game.",2
Cool,5
I originally gave this game 4 stars but since then they updated it and now it takes 24 hours to dig out some dirt where before it only took 12. Not to mention tons of other  stupid updates.,1
Nice,5
"Haven't tested to see if the raid glitches are gone yet, but so far I'm loving the new smaller UI it's perfect now!",5
"The recent update is infuriating. EA nerfed the desired aspects of the objectives I put significant effort to achieve. All that effort now wastes on a feature I deem no longer fit for use in any aspect of the game. EA killed spells by removing the channel time, forcing a predetermined efficiency and taking control out of the player's hands. The most popular spells they rendered so inefficient or expensive you can't use them to real effect without buying and using gems. Overt Money grabbing tactics",1
Was so happy to see this app existed.  Then I played it.,1
Package access helper has stopped. Won't even load.,1
I wait for things enough without adding this waiting simulator to the list.,2
The original base builder,4
"Originally gave game a 5.  Not any more.  In game purchases are stupid.  Charge me a fee for it once and screw the in game gem purchases.  Get rid of that crap entirely.  Second,  this app disconnects continually - about 4 times a minute some times and I am on a super fast connection and this started happening with the update.  Last WTF is up with an non release to the US for months.  I side loaded it originally just to play, and they broke it with the patch/update (probably deliberately).  Ridiculous!  Edit: 5aug 14 patch or something today.  Broke it.  Was abt to upgrade heart to 10 and the game now requires combat points instead of rock.  Imps are broken, cant go to them as it crashes when you click to go speed them up. Fix or it will be deleted.  Congrats, you now get a 1",1
game changed in new update so much I don't want to play.. Level 27 and now no longer playable unless you do the raids. Uninstalling on my phone and tablet and family that played also quitting over this drastic change to game. Should have just made dungeon heart 2 with this poor combat based crap and left this the way it's been all this time.,3
Takes for ever to grind out this game if you don't pay.  Fun though.,4
Hail Satan!!!,5
"I had issues with in-game purchases, customer service responded quickly and resolved my problem. Great game, although very slow without in-game purchases.",4
"This game is great. I always have fun playing it. It's not like the original but instead it's own beast and has it's own feel.  The graphics are great. The time limits on certain action may seem a bit long but patience is a virtue. Besides EA has provided a FREE DOWNLOADABLE GAME and I can tell they put a lot of work into it. All those that complain are just upset they can't play non stop like it was a console game....which you would normally pay for! Just get over and put your phone down sometimes,  jeez..",5
By the ego maniacs at EA. Had fun in the beginning but the moment you try to really expand and upgrade you get hit with that paywall.,1
"Not all together like the original, but has many if the same key elements. Still fun and challenging. awesome job bringing it and adapting it to keep it relevant in today's gaming world",5
"can't get enough of the game! Play multiple time a day! Join my guild, 420 friends!",5
The newest update is just terrible!,1
This game rocks!  The new update is great thank you.,5
"If you have what it takes to slap your minions in too shape... Vampires,mistresses,ghosts ext. To serve your every need! Rade & plunder endless dungeons for treasurers gold and gems!! Immortals to command for you've campaigns! See you in the shadows kepper... if you have the stones?",5
"First of all this is a mobile game, so don't expect the pc game. It uses the same elements but it is different imo a good way. Hint: don't use gems to speed up",5
Downloaded it with a hope that it would be somewhat similar to the game but the amount of time you wait to remove one block is 6 seconds then 4 hours then 24 hours. The amount of time you spend waiting ruins the game completely. I recommend you not downloading this. Should probably just avoid all ea mobile games,1
After months of playing this game it's really not as great as I thought... massively expensive for jewels. Game is a good time burner tho.,3
The game is pretty good. Dungeon keeper 2 on the pc is better.,3
"Great game, only time I have connection issues is when I'm on crappy WiFi signal, and have yet too spend any real money",4
"Game is a nice pvp setup for a casual game but be careful.   Phone call comes in while raiding, connectivity falters for a moment, real life needs your attention - you dont only lose the raid,  you lose minions,  mana, win streak.  I dont see why the game cant save your raid progress and let you resume within 5-10 min.  It would make the game a LOT better.",3
Similar strategy as Clash of Clans,5
Connectivity issues and load time fixed. From my Note2.,4
"The game is no longer playable.  All you get are load screens that tell you to wait while the imps get the dungeon in order... Only they never do.  It was fun when it worked, but it hasn't worked in a few weeks.  Been a few more weeks and the game is still unplayable.",1
This was a funny game back in the 90's. But this update is unplayable without investing in gems. It is just another Smurfberry scam.,1
"I just thoroughly enjoy everything I have encountered about this game. The pay to play aspects can be frustrating,  but you'll have that from time to time. The gameplay is fun and interesting, the graphics are whimsical and cartoon-ish without being campy or overdone. Overall, a wonderful game.",5
"I came in expecting to work harder to get anywhere in this game since I wasn't going to pay to win. I thought, ok these gem veins are 4h to dig. Maybe in a day or two I can afford another imp. Then I finished mining and got 3 maybe 4 gems with more then 300 to go. There is no way to play this game at all without paying for every inch of progress. How stupid does EA think we are? I have paid for cosmetic items in games I enjoy to support them, but EA is not getting a cent from me with this scam. Uninstalled!",1
"I know it's natural to keep up with trends but this is the butchering of a personally loved series for a micro transaction model that is blatantly ""pay 10 more dollars to advance"".",2
Great game I see no reason everyone is saying that this game sucks,5
"What a nice deal we have here in DK with the pop in, and notifications, can you guys add possession technique, I see why picking up minions whenever was not included for android, fun fun fun for me, and all the features in game, minions, defense's, rooms, etc.. they look so clear in detail in HD, graphics and gameplay is so smooth, it's a hangout, and guild's fit just right,",5
Best game ever,5
"This game is a lot of fun. I love the graphics and details that change as you upgrade. I love being a part of my Guild, we have tons of fun wrecking havoc together! Lots of carnage to be had come join us!",5
It's a good game that makes you wait so you don't get too powerful too quickly. The games all about strategy man.,5
Is a good game,5
Nothing revolutionary,3
Everytime I raid it restarts and I loose the raid even though I never got a chance to fight. Needs to be fixed now......does it even when hooked to wifi.,2
Fun,5
Only issue is how beautiful it was on.my friends tablet,5
Done in similar spirit to original but misses the mark. Wish they would revamp for PC,4
Fun game,4
He makes it 5(hella funny),5
And free.  Not as much variety in dungeon design but I understand why it is limited for a smart phone.  Basically a build and kill type game but instead of making buildings you make rooms.,4
"A fun, well run game that is different in theme.",5
"Not bad for EA GAMES  challenging , the live wall paper sucks Window pops on randomly.",5
This game is so much fun i have a hard time putting it down.,5
"Now, I don't know how many of you have the ORIGINAL Dungeon Keeper for PC. But if you have, you know this is an absolute disgrace! And also, $100 for 14,000 gems? That's enough to dig out 56 day long blocks! You can get both ORIGINAL Dungeon Keeper games for $10 on GOG. I think I'd rather play two full games than dig out 56 blocks.. How about you? P.S. To those of you saying to be patient.. Screw you. Games are not meant to be to the point where you wake up in the morning, tap a block, and then turn the game off. Games are supposed to be FUN. Now, I understand waiting a few minutes to build something but 24 HOURS?? You people need to play real games.",1
5+ times slower than clash of clans! The time for the slower tiles just increased to 24h again for me!,3
So sick of (please wait while your impure get your dungeon in order) always in a raid costing you everything!!!!,1
Great game when your bores at work haha,5
"Thank you for ruining this game, EA.",1
"Drains battery fast (it's all iv'e installed recently and my battery just dies when running it).   game is medicore, way too much waiting, still fun when you aren't waiting 4 hours to clear a brick.",3
I switched phones set up my gmail account I had a level 29 dungeon when i load the app it makes me start all over I only spent $10 but I'm very frustrated that I cant get my dungeon back... can someone help me out with this???,3
"You start with two imps which is not terrible, but then next imp costs 800 gems.  Too expensive IMO",4
Great,5
"Pretty funny dialogs, real strategy required,  and no huge pressure to buy anything.",5
Good game.  A lot of ads tho,5
Fun,5
So use them wisely. If use this game as a casual distraction it won't cost you a cent. The impatient will hate the first month of this game.,4
It was FIXED!,5
"I would pay for the app, stop trying to nickel and dime use to death.",1
Awesome!!!,5
Outstanding!  Just like the PC game.,5
Fun game,5
Disconnects any time I log in.,1
PvP protect your heart and go take theirs,4
"I loved this game on my pc and was really looking foward to this. Now, knowing that EA is releasing games that crash constantly on the most popular android tablet. I will never trust them again. So disappointed.",1
It keeps kicking me off and the prices shouldent be as high when you want to buy more gems or stuff but other wise its an awesome game and I would give it a five!!! :-),4
Really fun,5
"As stated before by other players, this game is plagued with connectivity issues. What's worse is that it cuts out during raids and other plays, which makes you automatically lose points, minions, and the cost of that play. Also these losses not only negatively affects your personal rankings but your league's overall ranking as well. Very frustrating.",1
Pretty cool,5
"This game is pretty similar to clash of clans and is better in some ways, in my opinion. I'd probably play it more if it didn't take 45 seconds on average to load. CoC in comparison takes about 6 seconds. Considering half the time I pop in the game I just want to gather resources and pop out, 45 seconds just makes me not want to bother",3
Love it so far,5
"The game is fun while being evil. Things do take a long time to upgrade, but you provide a fair amount of gems, with the digging and the daily bonus for raiding, that you can actually get imps. Of course my feelings may change on that in the future when I get to higher levels. And when are we going to get the casino room?",5
What's with all of these crappy pay to advance games?? I loved DK and DK2 But this game just sucks.. it's a sad attempt of a MOD for Clash Of Clans and Castle Clash... This is just sad.,1
Nice game,5
"Typical ea crapware. Bloated, broken, and tarnished a childhood memory. You guys really know how to make games. EDIT: still sucks balls.",1
I love this game a lot its pretty good,5
Keep your enemies close and your wallet closer this game is fun but it'll cost a small fortune to be successful at it. Update is an epic fail. Locks up at start screen.  Samsung Galaxy s5,1
Because that's what this game does.,2
Loved this game for months and then it just seemed like they stopped trying to make it engaging. I use to play DK on my PC. Huge old time fan. I WANTED TO LIKE THIS GAME! It was a disappointment however. Tournaments aren't fun. Constant adjustments to unit behavior. Odd inactive guild features. Mindless repetition. There hasn't been a good event/special in the game for months. More and more it's just trying to get you to spend $. Oh well. Guess it's back to my real life now.,2
Love it even better than the first one,5
Glad they brought this to the mobile market. Missed it since the old school original.,5
The Best Dungeon Game Ever,5
"However,  I agree with Mr. Charles Thomas. Gems are far too expensive. Been working on my dungeon for months. This WAY too long to level up....",1
Its fun but the wait times are to long and the need for crystals should really be toned down.,4
Worth the download,5
"It's absolutely ridiculous that an app would require so many permissions in order to install. This is a game, not an application for security clearance...",1
"Though, it crashes and refused to update and load, I have fond memories of it.",5
Pretty cool game.,5
"4 times a day, unplayable",1
Unless u want to wait 24 hours to dig a single block plus it will give u 7 gems Nd it will kill  ur phone battery. If u are looking for something good download clash of clans that game is so much better than this the chat nd everything,1
Would b better if it wasn't PAY TO WIN,1
Apparently I gave this game a 5 star rating even though I never played or even installed it! My phone wasn't even supported until recently. So one star from me for malicious vote mining.,1
This game is addictive and a lot of fun.,4
Just started playing and it's a lot of fun. I give it 4 stars since I just started.,4
It will not finish loading it will automatically log me out anems not load,1
"Careful of the pay to play, but otherwise the game is cute",3
"Now that I've hit level 27, recent fixes in the game probably make hitting heart level 5 more fun.  Now im level 27 and its really really difficult to raid. This wouldnt be so bad if I were still able to save up my supplys but seems like the raiding community is such a core part of saving enough gold and stone that its extremely difficult. .. Update so ea no longer has enough servers managing connections during tournaments making playing this game nearly impossible.",2
"I had the original game for my computer and loved it.  When I first started playing this version,  I loved it.  Game Play is good only problem is with the serious problem with connections.  It becomes impossible to play when you are getting dropped connections and I can tell I am not the only one that is having this problem.",1
,4
Fun,5
"every time I tried to play, the game crashed in the tutorial part, and shut of my phone in the process even when I re-installed it.",1
Cool,5
Awsome,5
But now I'm just waiting days to build stuff...pretty expensive stuff for a game...it's more of just me waiting now,3
"Kills time with a fun art style. Other than that, typical money grab F2P.",4
Keeps disconnecting on WiFi. Uninstalling.,1
H5,5
"Unlike other games of this genre, this one is really difficult to pick up. Also, not enough loot in raids. I've never seen more than 300, 000 of anything in a single raid...and that's being generous. Other than that, the originality of the game is there,  graphics are great, and the humor is spot on.",4
"Well, maybe try again . Next time, please try to make very clear that you have no intention of updating the game for any real people.  Crazy$$$$$ players win.............. Love the game otherwise, wish that it would be more more sensible.",2
"I've been playing this game for a while and have determined that this game is a huge turd.  Once you've mined all the gems in your area(Which aren't even enough to buy the imps you need) you will HAVE to spend money to get more as 1 or 2 at a time from raids are useless. Also, trying to control Immortals and minions is a f'n joke they won't go to the ""closest room"" or will pass right through rooms and the Immortals won't stay where you put them.  It's a bad joke compared to the original game.",1
"Came flooding back as soon as it booted up, loving this game",4
Though it sometimes takes time to load.  There are a lot of things to do once you get there.,5
Awesome!,5
"But it can get pricey.  UPDATE: the game takes WAY TOO LONG to load! I love playing the game, but I can start the app, make my self some food, then come back and start playing. Make the app start faster and I'll raise my rating.",2
Decent game so far.,3
So far so good,4
Well I'm going to give it a try again,2
"This reminds me a lot of the orivinal pc game; in a lot of good ways. I am enjoying the gameplay and humor, worth trying.",4
Cool But when a text comes in I start all over,4
Amazing game !!!,5
Fun game get it,5
Almost as awesome as the old school DK. On one hand it is better because it is mobile. But the game lost the redhand or claw that hovered over the dungeon.,5
Love the game. Keep up the good work.,5
Bring your credit card or need  not apply . money grab like no other,5
If ur lookin for a chill crew join us,4
"Hate the app it won't let me get on, waiting for an update that will fix the problem, but it looks like a cool game if I can play it",1
;),5
Ive played this game before and actually liked it. I give it all stars,5
"I miss the old Bullfrog. This has stolen my data It constantly reloads, or don't connect. And you want money to play that isn't right. Fix your game, don't disgrace the original",2
This game is an insult to the original dungeon keeper,1
Have not been able to get into my dungeon is almost a week now keeps saying error code 15,1
"I love the game, I hate the wait times but if they would implement cheaper options or pay 1 dollar for an imp then I would pay for that but not 5 bucks for 500 gems. I should not get a defeat if I get kicked out of an attack. I got kicked out because of stupid connection issues, and I get a defeat and lose mana. Bs please fix",2
"Not at all the original beloved DK/DK2 that EVERYONE wants a new version of. Not bad as a stand alone mobile game but giving it this revered name just leaves a bad taste. A bit buggy with frequent disconnects. On the whole fairly good but very poorly named.       Edit: ok after a few months it is prett obvious that this is more than a bit buggy. If you love staring at loading screens while recording losses that should be wins then this is the game for you. Literally 2/3 of the time it is unplayable. Sad programming and zero customer support. I liked the game but had to uninstall. In fact, it is best just to avoid all EA mobile games.",2
Fun but to be good costs money,4
Not a bad game,4
Doesn't run on brand new 4G LTE tablet. Trash.,1
"I have loved this game from the beginning! Thank you so much for creating this version. Its a new and fresh twist on an old classic, which I still play. The only complaint that I have is that the gems are too expensive to purchase. Any chance for a sale? Other than that, great job guys! Four stars up!!",4
The time you have to wait for anything is so high there is no point in upgrading something unless you have a week,2
Great game,5
Rilly fun,4
Best,5
Game seems to bave speed up some.  In app purchases still too expensive.,4
Clash is more fun... Once your mines are maxed it becomes impossible to gain enough resources to level up rooms etc.,1
"I was hoping for a simple port and retexture from the classic desktop. This is such a departure from the first two that there should be a caveat stating ""inspired by dungeon keeper"" somewhere. I don't mind the freemium format in principle but frankly EA has, yet again, ruined another otherwise great franchise. EA, listen, I loved the classic so much, I would have jumped at the chance to pay money for a stand alone version with the appropriate updates (e.g., resolution, 3d, new challenge). We wait over a decade for a third installment to the original, and you give us dungeon keeper lite: revenge of the pay scam? I mean, seriously, what's it going to take for you people to understand the concept of integrity; personal and within an IP? 4 stars because its well put together as a management game.",4
Its pritty cool,4
I loved the original game and this app is fun,5
"Honestly, if it weren't for the highly intrusive in game purchases, as well as the ludicrous wait times that try and make you pay for gems, the game is rather fun.",3
"The element of conquest is in this game I enjoy this game and I'm not even using all the games features yet, but I would defiantly recommend this game.",5
"This game has a horrible ay wall, in that every built item takes literal days to build or upgrade. But you can bypass that timer with $$. Has a lot of potential to be fun, but the microtransaction system kills it.",2
I feel that a lot of people are making lame td games and new dungeon keeper is finaly a good one,5
Fun and engaging,5
Reminds me when I played it on the PC,5
Great game,5
"I hate you. I have wasted 6 months of my life. my game ends every attack. Your servers suck. I even bought gems using real money do not waste your time, heed my warning.I would give it 0 stars but unfortunately I have to give it at least one just so you all can see this. p. S. Evan and Daniel share my pain......please fix this mystic before you lose me and much more.",1
Fix please. Still won't run on Nexus 10. Zero stars.,1
Waiting for time to go by in game is a bad feature.  The original Dungeon Keeper was much more challenging and interesting.   That said I do enjoy the game...but I refuse to pay for gold or gems.,3
Love This dungeon game its EPIC,5
Deleting this crap now. Connection nightmare. Crashes on WiFi and crashes on 4G doesn't matter. Code 7. All of the time. Wasted time and money. Support is terrible and inept. The game is just broken. EA should set a better standard than some garage computer hacks.  Loved this game when it came out. Knock down to one star after updates. Now would give it ZERO stars. Terrible. Uninstall.,1
The game wiped out 500 of my gems...,1
Very much in keeping with the original game :-) thank you doing such a good job With it,4
I love this game. I have the origional on my pc.,5
"Nehd,e",5
"Game ok. Not too many instrusive ads while playing. This is a casual game ... you play 5 min then drop it and do something else. In app purchases higher than modern warfare by GREE. New reinforced walls bad idea. Game should have limited unbreakbale walls . Dev trying to fix multiplayer matching, but it is still broken.",3
"Great game! They give you plenty of gems through achievements, but everything is so expensive, it really doesnt matter. Ifyou dont want to spend $ on this, be prepared to wait days, when you get more advanced.",4
Nothing but timers that wants to force you to pay to play. It's nothing like Dungeon Keeper that I grew up playing with. Thanks EA for ruining the games I like.,1
"I still have all the versions of DK for PC and anxiously awaited this release and patiently played it from the beginning.  I was only vaguely aware of the negative feedback the game has received because of the tinesinks and the in play purchases.   I really enjoy this format!  I am a very busy person.  So five minutes here and five minutes there is perfect for me.  And I know that everyone else has either waited as long as I have or skipped, either way it supports good gaming!",5
so much fun but the higher the level the longer takes to load.,5
Really adictiv3 but the most fun I had since lego:p,5
"The server disconnect issues are horrific. It will kick you in the middle of raids, and randomly during dungeon upkeep. It seems specifically set to disconnect you during survival raids, which of course cost gems (pay to play mechanic) to retry. I'm about to uninstall.      UPDATE: it just dumped me AGAIN in a survival raid I was about to win. (7/21/14)",1
I have always loved the Dungeon Keeper games. This just makes my day. I love it.,5
,5
"Outside of the constant iap. It's great, notably the game can be played and receive everything the game has to offer without iap",4
Fun to play,4
Awesome game,5
"Doesn't meet up to the standard of the old games. Gameplay is VERY slow and rather boring. I did the time and it takes about 2 weeks to reach ONE of the corner mines/quarries with 2 Imps (workers) honestly. I came in with good intentions and the game just feels like a pay to win, broken app.",1
Can no longer play.  Experiencing connection issues every time I try and start the game.,1
"No way to turn off notifications. At that point, I don't care how good the game is, that's just obnoxious.",2
I love this app but maybe could the company add dsome more features for example not having to pay to change the name of your dungeon. Also if you could fight with guild members that would be great and with great prizes like gold and stone. Also maybe on holidays cut down the price for imps by half because I dont wanna wait  to earn 800 gems..XD Hopefully the company could add these. Then I rate 5! ‚à©__‚à©,4
Just like pc awesome.,5
Good job runs smooth,5
Doesn't suck.,4
About time,5
Everyday.  Everytime I try to play.  Please wait while your imps get your dungeon in order message appears and I can never actually play.  Don't bother with this game.  It's too expensive and you will just get angry due to constant connection issues that EA doesn't care to resolve.,1
"I could spend hours on this app!  It uses strategy to engage the mind,  It has been put together by imaginative people who used great graphics and humor to keep the user entertained.",4
Love this game however the PC game was way better. I wish they would come up with a Dungeon Keeper 2 PC game,4
Besides the in-app purchases its accualy a pretty good game!,5
"This is my favorite PC game and now I can play on my Android! Only 2 problems : won't stay connected to my WiFi and I had extreme difficulty putting in my dungeon name. Other than that, I absolutely love it!",5
Old new school,5
Good graphics,4
"This game would be fantastic except for microtransactions.  I would buy this for a one time price in a heartbeat, but I'm not going to sink any kind of recurring funds into it",3
"Tedious to say the least, some of the more important tasks take an exorbitant amount of time to complete, or a ridiculous amount of in game currency to ""rush"".  This is nothing but a heartless attempt to copy another terrible money grab called Clash of Clans.  If there were a ""paid"" app without IAP and reasonable ""build"" times, I would be very interested.",1
Fun but don't want to have to buy my way would rather work my way up,4
Easy to play nothing to pay,5
Game becomes unplayable once you are a high level.  Constant server crashes cost you most of the rewards the game can offer.  Avoid this game until they fix their servers.  All raid attempts fail now.,2
Super incredible!,5
Fun Trap Building,4
Good time waster and one of the best games I played,5
Freezes.  Unable to purchase gems.,5
"Great dungeon keeper game formula is still there.  Join our guild ""Silver Claws"" and get in on the ground floor of a quality guild.  We are looking for members.",4
"I've just started and I like how this is a ""darker"" version of all the other kinds of games out there like this one",4
Free to play? What EA really means is you have to pay to play and pay to win. This game is nothing but a clever way to rob you with its microtransactions. Don't want to buy them? Then good luck doing even the most basic actions in the game. EA is nothing but a money-grubbing disgrace of a company. Totally deserving of the title of Worst Company in America.,1
Scam,1
Love this game hehe,5
More micro transaction bs from ea. Gotta pay to win in this sham of a game.,1
Great game,5
Fun,4
Love this,5
Great,5
"In the tutorial level it takes a couple seconds to remove blocks. After the tutorial 2 hours. Also you get 5 gems for an achievement, costs 800 for a grunt.",1
Takes way to long to upgrade. Gems cost $100? Who pays that? Cant drop minions after placing once. The real dungeon keeper on pc was better,2
"For weeks now I have not been able to log on and play. It just constantly says ""connecting"". I let it go for a hour one day and it still never connected. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game several times and nothing seems to work. I have spent money on this game and Im very disappointed. Just going to start playing something else.",1
Tameka.   Williams,3
"Wish the timers were shorter for excavation, but not bad. I am a huge fan of the original games.",4
"Entertaining. Probably end up needing to pay to win eventually. Meanwhile, it will help me waste some time.",4
I love this game. The only downside so far is the build times are slow,5
Fun game.  Far less in-depth than its namesake. I'll never give 5 stars to a game that's centered around continuous hits to the wallet.,3
I like to have my own dungeon!! So nice!,5
A hideous waste of time and effort. Built around near criminal business practises. This kind of business model is a cancer to the gaming industry.,1
"I was a big fan of this series back in the day, so it's fun to dive back in, even though the mobile version doesn't compare to the original. Overall it's a fun tower defense game, but it's hamstrung by the crazy in game purchases necessary to succeed at this game.",3
Starting to hate this wait while imps load bs and keep losing on gems and loot so I'm gonna tell everyone I know to not play and delete this game,2
"This game would be good, if it didn't have ridiculus wait times to use up gems, which cost REAL money.",3
Not worth it.,1
awesome app git now,5
Sux,1
Love it,5
Started interesting but eventually became boring.  Nothing to keep this player involved.,2
Could be faster,4
Fun game. Really addicting.,5
I loved it when it first came out for PC in 1997. But its even better now. Just wish imps didn't cost so many gems :-(! But over all really happy :-D,5
"I use to play the PC version and am glad they made a mobile version.  I like that it has both a single player mode and multi player raid mode.  I'm certain the multiplayer will outlive both of its predecessors.  I have run into a few bugs, but EA reports that they are working on it.",4
Deff passes the time very fun only 4 start to I learn more,4
I used to play this all the time because my mom had it on her tablet It would not let me download a long time ago But she does not have it any more because her tablet rebooted she sent her tablet back yesterday she is geting a new one now But still I love this game and it is the best,5
Played this game back in the day on pc. Great adaptation from pc to mobile. Tons of fun!,5
"doesn't work on blu stacks for windows, only game that i have had not work...",1
"Ok, slow..",4
"It's not my WiFi, it's a problem with the game. Two out of three times it disconnects when I'm raiding, which counts as a loss. Fix this and I'll rate it higher.",2
Avoid all EA freemium games because they make it a point to tell you they're robbing you.,2
"If you've loved the original game, you're going to see a lot of familiar faces. This game copies a lot from Clash if Clans and Samurai Siege, yet with it's own demonic twists! Attacking is very lively, and defending it's more intuitive. Overall, a very satisfying game!",5
"Its a good game, but the match finding needs to be fixed. Too often im matched against people way further along then me",3
Awesome game needs to be a little more like the old one but I love it,5
"Great graphics and theme.  However, if spending hours looking at frozen screens and rebooting the same program over and over are your thing,  then this game is for you. If not, move on and don't waste your time.  The game is free,  but so is the aggravation.",1
See what I did there?,5
"So other than the overly aggressive IAP policy, its fun. Harder on a phone, the screen is too small.",4
Soul sucking..in a good way ;p,5
Another survival raid fubar Thanks to the connection issues... Please fix this.,1
It's like being the boss of your own EA company!,1
Really good app,5
"Dig the game,  but the build times are quite long at the higher levels.   Also,  gems are WAY overpriced....",3
It a good game nice to play,5
I'm connected to WiFi and have constant connect problems. I can surf the web on my phone with no problems. This issue needs to be fix or uninstalling,2
"Entertain type of diabolical puzzle/strategy game thumbs up guys, keep up the good work EA",5
EAËøòÊàëÂÆùÁü≥,5
Addictive fun!,5
Very good game. Not just tower defense but you get to raid other peoples dungeons also.,5
One of my all time favorites delightfully evil,5
Can't put it down. Commentary is hilarious. Torture is a nice twist on builder games,4
Its the only game I have on my phone !,5
Very well done! Fun to play :),5
I really liked this game but due to recent updates it brings me back to my dungeon when I'm raiding or defending during anything so have to give 1,1
Great fun!,5
Nothing like the real one,1
Love this app far more than clash of clans. Takes awhile to get stuff if you don't spend any real money but far easier to establish your dungeon than it is on c.o.c....,5
Awesome game,5
I had been playing this for two months. Had a awesome set up. Now it gets to 90% loaded and just stops. I've reinstalled twice. Still nothing. EA owes me money for my gems.,1
Takes a while to build up your dungeon but fun.,4
I love the game,5
It looks fun. My boyfriend likes it but on my phone(galaxy s) I get error code 7 and it won't connect. Fix this and I'd gladly give it 5 stars,3
"I really enjoy the game, but I loose the important raids because it reloads at this critcal points. Fustrating enough to make me stop playing.",1
Been a fan since DK1 on PC.,5
"I don't know how to spell but I do know this, it's the freaking best game ever.",5
Decent game but needs more monsters and rooms,4
"I've gotten pretty deep into this game, and it's a fun diversion in limited quantities. However, it's stuffed with little inconveniences so they can charge you money to make them go away. I wouldn't mind if I could just pay once and for all, but all they offer are one-off fixes, so you'd have to spend a fortune to keep the game reliably fun. On the other hand, this does keep the game from turning into a time sink, since you have to do a lot of waiting if you don't want to pay.",3
"They could of charged us 4-6$ for the game and keep it like the classic , but instead went with the pay to play crap and wasted this game. Also pricing of items is crazy a la Ea",2
Decent way to kill some time,4
The game downloads heavy updates at launch without any option of downloading over wifi only. Several times I've opened the app with they loading bar stating it's downloading 50 megs of updates without giving me any choice to cancel or stop it.,1
"EDIT- still not fixed after months, going down to 1 star, unacceptable.                      On the loading screen it will stay frozen saying ""connecting"" but doesn't do anything else. I'll have to force close the game several times before it will load properly. Samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition",1
I really enjoy the game when it works. Disconnects often even over WiFi with excellent connection. Losing raids and resources every other time you play is no fun. Hopefully they can fix this if not this might be one to delete. Also expensive...,2
Waaaaaaay over does it on the in app purchases. You can hardly play once you get a little bit into the game...Unless you spend significant amounts of money. Way to go EA.,1
"bad business model, i would pay money to get the game and just play it as intended.",1
The fact that you lose all mana and players you have used in a battle if the game loses connection is complete nonsense...also the constant lagging and disconnects are frustrating. This app should work without having to be constantly connected to the web...ex only connect after battles are completed etc to mitigate connection issues. Fun game but frustrating with the connection problems,3
I'm ashamed to say that I spent money for gems on this game. I was Level 20 and then the update happened. I haven't been able to play again since. During raids when I was able to play 1 out of 5 raids would just end because of connection issues and break any win streak you were on.,1
Touch controls need to be improved as does loading times but its a fun game,4
There I gave u five stars this game is really cool and fun but now maybe we should be able to control where our people go so like pick the warrior u want then click on the thing u want to attack maybe please try ur best and work on that thank u,5
One of my favorite games until I reached higher levels it constantly crashes when I raid with large armies then counts it as a lose against me and I'm out the money to resummon and mana please fix stability,2
"Gems too expensive, but the rest of the game is fun",4
Its a good game even though its a lot of pay stuff,5
All my other apps work fine but since the last update I can not play it throws a error cannot connect to server no matter how many times u force close or try to connect it wont dont waste your time on this,2
"I like the game, is funny.",5
A fun way to kill some time and not bad to pick up again a while.,4
Love this game!,5
awesome! reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper PC version back in the day  :),5
I cant even complete the tutorial tried to do it again and still can't complete I would really like to play this,1
Okay game with great graphics but I am getting very tired of it reloading my dungeon when I am in the middle of a battle.  This needs to be fixed before I spend a dime on this game!  Upgrades take too long and Imps cost too much.  I like playing this game but at some point the fun is outstripped by the wait time and the punitive cost of gems.  Fix the restarts and drop the build/upgrade times and I might be tempted to buy gems.  Also way too many notifications and audible alerts in the notification bar.,2
Innovatively awful,1
"It's not a bad game though I was really hoping for something more like the original Dungeon Keeper. It's got all the standard elements of the popular games of this genre out there... armies to build up, spells, guilds to join and gems that can be purchased... but with the DK humor mixed in. If you've got patience, you don't have to feel forced to spend money. There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of newbie bashing at this point in time which should allow you build yourself up and have fun.",4
Horr bible gameplay,1
,5
Awesome,5
Fun,4
It can be a little dull at sometimes but its fun if you need to kill time,4
"I generally wait about one year to rate an app as to have an honest opinion. I tried many games and play Dungeon Keeper pretty much every day, it's a very fine app always innovating and engaging. Very fun and you do not have to spend if ya don't want to.",4
"Lags , resets, ea always has pay to pay but I'm tired of it asking me to review lol",5
"Constant network crashes causes the loss of win streaks, loss of time, and possible loss of gems which can amount to real money. The constant crashes make raiding nearly impossible and pointless, it's OK if you don't wanna raid, but then whats the point.",1
This game ruined the old dungeon keeper game I used to love and turned it in to another one of these games,1
"Nickeled and dimed to play, no thanks.",1
"Pretty good, reminiscent of the old version of dk. Cooldown times and imp costs are a bit high. Otherwise an enjoyable time sink.",4
Don't expect high speed shooter. Its slow going building and deploying defenses,4
"Game used to be pretty good but lately it has been horrible. Game claims connection issues where none exist. For a fun pocket game I'm not willing to spend 30-40 minutes rebooting in order to get 3 minutes of play time. Come on people, get your game fixed.",1
PvP version of the old DK title. Strategy and local tactics make this a lot of fun.,5
"A lot of my complaints have been satisfied since playing this game.  Traps can now be reset without imps and now they can all be reset at the same time which is good.  My biggest complaint now is that you can't collect mana if your library is being upgrade.  As upgrades can now take multiple days, I basically can't raid for multiple days because I can't use any of my spells.  Trust me, you can't raid without spells.  Since raiding is practically the only reason to play this game, you basically can't play...",4
"With every new patch you release for this game it takes a month or two for me to be able to play it again. Constant loading screens and disconnections during raids make this more frustrating than ever, please fix if you even care. Ready to uninstall the game and never play another EA game that wasn't thoroughly tested before release, which these days seems to be most.",1
My old review I asked that they half dig times of 24 hour blocks and they did. My review might be really biased since I love these types of games. The connection problems that people talk about don't happen to me since I pay for the best Internet possible. I love the humor of this game. You can easily love the game when you start playing. What more can I say I love this game now.,5
"Good game, some people don't know that.",5
Yes,5
Game is fun to play but slow going if money isn't spent on imps.,3
the biggest problem with this game is the fact that it disconnects fairly often. I'm a fan of the orginal Dungeon Keeper and this game sucks in comparison. the gems are far too expensive though not too necessary either. overall I wish I could give this game a 2.5 star rating but I guess 3 will suffice. at the very least fix your atrocious servers and I'm sure I could throw a few more stars.,3
You don't have to spend real money as long as you have patience,4
"I can't do any of the event raids or the find an opponent raids. It will start to open it and I can see the countdown and then it says loading and goes back to my dungeon. What fun is that!? I can usually do the campaign raids but I can't get any gems from those and my dungeon is huge lol I have all of the rooms, I just need gems now. I'm so not about to dig every gem area in my dungeon in hopes I'll make enough for another imp. Either fix it so I can actually play the rest of the raids or I'm out :(",2
But am now experiencing start-up/update problems,3
This game takes forever to load.  Similar games take less than half the time to load.  Recently the game will not connect to the servers right away. Multiple devices and multiple network connections with same issue so I know it's not me. EA needs to fix this!,1
Fun be patient and its free,5
It's ok,5
Got bored quickly,3
Fun game and great humor!!!,5
I don't like games that make you continuously pay for decent game play. Make it less vampire like on my wallet and I'd give it 4 stars.,2
So I loved the game until it forced me to install the update. Now it won't even connect.,1
Have to retry connecting three and four times every time you open it,3
Amazingly polished version of one of my original PC classics. Great work developing and producing game. Very smooth and fabulous graphics and gameplay! :-),5
"This game stretches every single task to the point where you are forced to buy ""Gems"" to progress. Not even worth the install size which is small.",1
"Good game. Fun, dark and comical.",4
The little bit that I can play is fun all I can do is claim the dungeon heart quarry than build the workshop than it disconnects and I have to do it again. I recommend not to install. Its too bad you can't give no stars because I would,1
It freezes a lot,3
Loved original game very good update,5
I used to play this on the PC years ago and I love the mobile adaptation.,5
Verry addictive but to advance fast you gotta spend real cash. Parallel kingdom is a much better game and you dont have to pay to play and go far.,4
"Very enjoyable, but not too campy.",4
I like this game,4
"It almost impossible to complete a raid now, the latest updates are very very poor. I've had at least 20 crashes today, I'll wait until next update to start playing again. Doesn't matter how good the gameplay is if it falls over like an umbrella in the wind all the time.",1
Such keeping!,5
Excellent Game,5
I love this game!!,5
Boom....,5
Having constant network connection errors....  Would love to play but get tired if fighting the network errors...,2
This should not exist.,1
It you want to accomplish anything you're going to have to spend quite a bit of dough.  I can't justify spending that kind of money on such a slow and unrewarding game.  The wait time emphasizes this further.  If you don't want to pay it is not worth your time.,2
Love this game,5
"Really fun game! I'll admit though it really could use a storage ability for rooms and stuff though, after building things it becomes difficult to move things around the way you want. Let us store constructed rooms and traps please.",4
Great way to kill a little time,5
Well done,4
Best of Its kind. Hands down. Must down load now.,5
"Good game if I wasn't interrupted during raids, it certainly isn't my WiFi. Fix this issue and I would give this game 4 or 5 stars.",3
"I'm sick of all these in app purchases, 24 hours for ONE block? You gotta be kidding me",1
"I'm stuck playing this app that I don't really like. It's not very good because of the money that's required to spend to advance with any kind of aclarity. The instructions are not very good and you can't find them when you need them. You're given one chance to learn something before you need to use it and then u cant find the instructions anymore on how to use it. That's very confusing. I'm trying to like this game, but its not being pulled off very well. The PC game from back in the day was much better.",2
This game is loads of fun definetly  a must have for fans of tower defense games and also the game overlord. Tons of fun and plenty to do.,5
The matchmaking process in this game has to be a joke and only seems to get worse with each update.,1
Slow going at first but still a golden classic,4
When it works it's fun. Connect to retry errors when logging in are no fun. Raiding another dungeon and then get hit with the imps are getting your dungeon in order error is no fun. When this bug hits you lose troops regardless.  I reduced the stars because of these errors.,3
I like to play such games,5
Newest update broke game,1
"This game is one of the better ones with this type of charicters and fighting, having issues with connecting to the internet at times and don't know why. But other than that the time waiting to build objects could be a lot less. Game is fun..",5
Its a great game but It takes forever to upgrade.....,5
I like this game a lot. I find it devilishly interestingly fun!,5
Wont let me connect to the server.,1
"I'm a HUGE fan of the original PC game. Come home from a nite of work w/ aggravating customers, get out my aggression by slapping the Hell outta my minions! Made me feel so much better! UPDATE 7/2/14: Constantly getting ""Imps putting Dungeon in order"" during raids, especially when I'm gonna win! & my connection is OK. Makes me feel like the app is cheating!!! Also havta in & reinstall once a month cuz it stops working!!!",3
Fun game. Like the interaction married with solo play,5
"While fun at first you quickly run into huge time sinks without the use of gems, which are far too expensive. That is if you're even able to connect to the server to play.",1
It is fun but the cost of things is way off balance you unlock a new item and have to upgrade your stone storage 3 times before you can use it so it taked days and days to accomplish some tasks I wish the wait times were shorter and there always something to do when you open this game it seems like you just tell your imps to do one thing and turn the app off for several hours raids are kinda fun but you loose everyone you summon even if they survive which makes no sense so you just spend gems to play,4
It takes way too long for upgrades. Imps are far too expensive and if you only have a couple it takes ages to build a decent dungeon. I played DK for the pc and LOVED it. I want to love the app too but it has issues. I get that they have to make money but it sucks to play for 5 minutes then be out of resources unless you pay for more (which I will not do). I've almost deleted the app out of frustration a few times. Y'all asked me to rate it and this is my honest rating.,3
Its fun,4
While I admit I've only had the game briefly I do like the ideas I see. Further review pending further gameplay,4
Great game and addictive,5
IAP are a bit much but the game is fun.,4
"Addicting as Hell, but this current version can't connect to the server.",2
"Loved this game back in the day. Relatively smooth transition to app. Hate the whole raiding other players and they can raid you, though. I just want to play a game.",4
Tried to get in but says unable to join server please fix,1
"I have to reinstall the app to ""connect to the server"" any time I want to play the game. Keep my $15 -- thanks for wasting my time.",1
"I enjoyed the game but the connection issues frustrated me to the point that I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. To no avail I was still unable to get back into the game. So I uninstalled it for now. If the problem ever gets corrected, then I will gladly install it again.",3
Id rather spend $10 for a mobile clone of the original Bullfrog title.,1
Funny twisted humor with simple yet fun gameplay. Great game.,5
"Big DK fan, but this game is no fun. Takes forever to do anything without buying diamonds. At least give us a $5 game that is somewhat playable, I'm soo sick of this pay to win (or do anything) crap.",1
Such a disappointment... PC version was fantastic. This game is.... pathetic money grabbing freemium junk..,1
Can't play at all uninstalled and reinstalled still won't work,5
"Been playing for a long time and I love this game. Good time killer, lots of upgrades and it requires a good strategic defense.",5
So I've never found a game that was like castle crasher that did not need money so I can play. Game works out. Use those gems wisely. And after u spend them just hold on the game is very interactive for all players money or not. Your dungeon is based on your time given. Later Keepers!,5
Stop reading and start playing.,5
"Gameplay isn't half bad if you like clash of clans style games. The problem lies with EA's poor server reliability. Constant timeouts, little optimization for mobile devices, and currently can't even get in due to constant ""cannot connect to server errors"".  I've been playing for a few months and while the core mechanics are Ok, these other issues kill the game.",1
The game no longer connects. I'll keep an eye on it.,2
Great game! Addiction is a better way to describe this game! I only have one complaint. Please fix the fact that the game does not work on my samsung pad 3. It works great on my samsung note 3.,5
Awesome blast from the past,5
I'd recommend it to anyone who would enjoy tower defense.,5
"You can wait 1 year for another star or you may purchase an additional star for $19.95 or 4 for $69.95 (best deal).  If that seems crazy, play this game, after 3 minutes you will know what I mean.",1
"Between the not being able to do anything for hours upon hours with the wait times to dig or build, the constant disconnections mid-raid, the random disconnections, and often the complete inability to even connect at *all*, it's a MIRACLE anyone even bothers with it. And really? 32K+ people voted 5 stars? A perfectly made game? These people shouldn't even be allowed to use the rating system since they have no idea how to actually rate things.",2
So awesome that my head nearly exploded,5
Great version of a classic. EXCEPT the expectation that we will pay $100 for gems. Are you &%*#-#+% kidding?,4
"Took a great premise established from the previous two games and destroyed it with farmville click/wait/spend_money.  Designed to take your money.  Nothing more, nothing less.",1
"Amazing game with a great development team. A wonderfully complex, highly customizable, tower defense style game!",5
So the game itself is pretty good but when they have these bonus raids it would always disconnect on the 6th wave and I would lose... so until that's fixed I'm not too happy with this game and it's not my connection either. Fix this and patch ASAP cause I'm tired of spending gems on retry if I know this is just some scam. Will re rate after reimbursement.,2
I love it. Plenty of low-brow humour and enough one-liners to keep you laughing all day.,5
Nice game.,5
I love this game how cool is it that you can make a dungen,5
"Sadly, not optimized well and takes forever to load on a tablet with 1gig of RAM.",3
You should make it to where you have to verify if you want to cancel something. I just cancelled a 12 hour rock when I was one hour away. Almost made me want to s to playing.,4
"I enjoy the humor, and the dungeon creating.  I'm a fan of the old Dungeon Keeper game, and this is reminiscent of that title.  What I don't appreciate is the heavy handed way they present the micro transactions.  I've resisted purchasing ""gems"" so far, but this is blatantly a pay to win game.  Which means at some point, I'll get frustrated with that disparity and uninstall it., or cave, and buy some. :P.    EDIT: Stars lowered until the game starts working again.",1
Keep having connection issues. It's very frustrating.,2
Love this game. It is easy but fun to play,5
I loved the original dungeon keeper game but this game holds none of the greatness of the original.  Just another farmville like transaction game.,2
"A remake, good, but too simple. I miss number 2.",4
"Now that I've played it a bit. It's a straight rip of CoC but underground. Unfortunately you're forced to spend money on gems if you want to get far.  The upgrade costs for virtually everything are completely screwed up (and high) and seem arbitrary relative to the resource generation rate. As such, my imps are almost always idle, sitting around scratching their butts. Oh, and the weekly bonus survival raids now occur.... whenever. Maybe they should tell us its still in beta. This is not a finished product.",1
"Not as good as the original, but fun for a mobile platform.",4
Enjoying the game so far,5
"This is not a game, but is simply a money grab. Worthless...",1
Fun,2
Neat Game,5
Yeah,5
I like everything about it,5
"Looking to play originals dungeon keeper on android well keep looking this ain't it, but it's still a really good game, if your patient like me and can play short spurts and wait 9 days for upgrades and not want to pay a single dime this may be tour game ;)",5
Great game. Great graphics. Great experience!!!,5
"Even as a powerful player when you can have days of work wiped out in a few minutes and multiple immortals captured by opponents, it begins to suck really quickly when you realize the only way to play is to pay.",1
Very nostalgic and great graphics. I don't typically play games but this one brings me back,4
Amazingly addicting,5
The DK2 for PC was better. Takes half a day for hard rock and not much space to build in.,4
Black screen after a moment throws back into the system.,2
Good game but the in app purchase are a bit spend,5
Reminds me my kid days playing dk and dk2,5
Love this game,5
It's a awesome game I love it,5
DK next gen. Need I say more.,5
Awesome,5
Good game love it keep up the good work .,5
This is a really fun game both my son and I are having a blast playing it. Only down side is that the gems are very expensive.,5
It's addictive and fun.,5
"Happy player, but as of yesterday it won't load. Boot up screen goes to nowhere. Tried remove and reinstall, no change.",1
It's okay do enjoy playing it,3
Imagine a developer or company that has never played dungeon keeper. Then hand them a bunch of screenshots and say make an android version. This us the result. A game that takes no skill and can easily be won if you pay real money.,1
Good,4
Great game... can't stop playing,5
It's a good game but storage and resources max out to early.,3
I love the game but the connection issues are a big pain to deal with I just lost a large win streak cause of it and I was going to get revenge on this guy just to get some gems and the connection crashed on me as soon as I was only 5 seconds in the attack,3
Cash grab. A spit in the face to the original.,1
It is enjoyable,5
This game is a very fun time waster. . Join Bowtie Gang if you want to have fun playing!,5
Wish it played more like DK2.,3
I was excited when I saw this game on the play store. But was quickly disappointed when I realized that it is just a Facebook game clone. A terrible thing to do to this game.,1
It is so fun,5
Just like the origional,4
Great app! Smack those workers to get them going. It is the little things lol,5
"A lot of fun. A little slow going after a few hours, and it seems like you still have to spend money to keep going, but worth trying",4
It good very addicting. .,4
"This game is a totall piece of dudu. Let me explain. It is not the problem that doing anything takes forever for example 6 days to upgrade treasury from level 9 to 10 or 12 hours to remove rock . That is not a problem. Problem is that : it takes forever to load the game , game crashes all the time , when you are attacking some one and lets say you get a call or message from in example viber ,well you just lost the game,your internet connection drops ,same thinG.THIS IS RIDICULES !!!",1
Great fun.,5
"This is an incredibly well polished and charming delay based build-your-own-dungeon manager and in the past few days its really eaten up a surprising amount of my time. Your little helper, aplty name Horny, is probably one of the most fun assistants I've seen in a game all year. My only complaint is the shameless cash grab and in-app purchases this game promotes. But that's EA for you. If you can get past that you'll find a fun, well put together, and rewarding dungeon manager!!",4
"Used to have a different opinion. Was fun, liked the free gems you earned. By the game has become unplayable. Constant ""Loading. Please wait while the imps set up your dungeon"" every few seconds! Even after reinstall!!!",1
Fun and evil. Lol,5
BEST GAME ON THE MARKET ....,5
Asome,5
Come to tattooed souls guild,3
"Aside from Gems being too expensive, upgrade times take forever, bad network issues with Imps needing to straighten up my dungeon, where are the dragons? Where are the gem vains? Where is the casino or combat room so there is a way to cash in gold coins for gems, perhaps? The Mistress is too skinny, traps take too long to make, connections aside, seriously, update these issues...",2
Its fun and addictive,5
Constantly spams with notifications that fill up the entire notification bar.  Even speaks out loud when the game isnt open - a mysterious voice kept occuring when I was watching a video and I couldn't figure it out - its this. The entire game is meant to drive you to paying for gems to speed up stupidly long tasks.  Not fun but spams you so you play and hopefully pay ridiculous sums for gems.  Also takes forever to start up.,1
I've enjoyed it so far.,4
I upgraded my phone...  and was worried I would have to start over. NOPE! DK kept my dungeon ready. When I downloaded it on the new phone everything was already there... I didn't lose a thing!,5
Funner,4
Okay,2
"Pretty fun, haven't played long",4
"The game has major connection issues (error code 7). It seems really interesting just wish I could play it, especially after the long update I waited through. Please fix",2
Old school love this game,5
"CAN YOU PLEASE ADD A UPDATE THAT YOUR GUILD TEAMMATES CAN BUY IMPS FOR YOU FOR 100,000 COINS PLEASE. OR LOWER THE PRICE OF THE IMPS.",5
My one star rating and negative review keeps disappearing.  This game is a huge cash rip off.  For only 4.99 on GoG you can buy the original DK and have a LOT more fun.,1
"I've been playing this for a few months now. But now it is so hard to get resources to upgrade as others keep stealing them and upgrades take forever. Time to uninstall, it was fun in the beginning though.",2
Funny fun to play,5
I really like this game. My only complaint is that the game crashes here and there. Especially when I'm in the middle of a raid. But other than that... A+++,4
"Love every aspect of this game, as for those that complain about the prices, this game has expensive and affordable options.",5
Too buggy and way too many errors I can't play because it won't let me name my dungeon,1
Pretty cool game wished I would know a little bettter on learning the game,4
Tired of it crashing mid raid..,2
"The ""Ascending Knights"" a top 25 guild in tournaments is looking for a few hard fighters. Can you pledge at least 15 combat stars for tournaments AND donate minions on a regular basis??? We are going for top 3 and are looking for people who like and want to play and win! Sound like you? JOIN US... Once accepted, immediately post ""T.R.F., I will win over 15 combat stars in the next tournament!"". If not you WILL be kicked. See you In game!",5
I want to start over from scratch and I can't. So im uninstalling.,1
Love this game I remember when it was a computer game and now it's an app for my phone and free too whaattt so legit got to love dungeon keeper!!!,5
"The game is good, however when starting it is hard to build anything.",4
Excellent game,5
"I would have paid 10 bucks or more for anything close to the original game, that I could play on my phone. However, this just seems like a wait a day to build something or pay to get it done game...good thing I still have and old PC at home that runs the original...to bad I can't take it with me. I'll keep playing for a bit, just because I love the game, but don't expect I will keep it much longer. Thanks for trying.",2
"I did a retry raid for 30 gems and all of a sudden in the middle of raiding.. ""please wait while your imps blah blah blah"" after that it took me back to my dungeon.. so I retried again for another 30 gems and did the same thing.. I don't wanna retry for another 30 gems cuz it might happen.. is there any way I can get my 60 gems back? Please help asap cuz I wanna do the raids",1
Good if you aren't looking for something to actually kill time with.  It would be better if it wasn't so slow to load. Also it would have been better if it wasn't pay to win. I mostly blame EA.,3
Awesome,5
"I downloaded this game because I played the original back in the day. Like most free to play games the developers are out of their minds in their pricing, and as soon as the game gets fun, it gets expensive. Give someone else your money. They won't charge you a dollar a second.",2
Great game lots of fun playing,5
my favorite of this kind of game and it keeps getting better ;),5
This game could be fun but it plays like a beta. They make change with no notice and the description of unit isn't even  updated to reflect changes. I furustrates me to no end as if only after u wasted resources and time building unit or planing your defence that u realize the change and have to wait an hour or more planning or rebuilding your units. Also u get disconnect all the time and lose everything u spend during a raid even thing that cost actual money and it a automatic lost.Ea needs to fix that asp,2
Very fun,5
Only bad things is the the cost gems and the amount of time it takes to mine gems and  the time to do upgrades I like that is you can still play other parts of the game that don't need gems like plundering. Its one of my favorite games so far.,5
"It strips out all of the charm of the original series and crams what's left into the trite pay-or-wait city builder formula. If that's your thing, you'll like it. I was hoping for a version closer to the old PC titles. I would have paid $10 for a port of the originals with updated graphics, but these games that make you pay to advance or wait forever get old really fast, and this just feels like a hollow knock-off of the series.",1
Fun,5
"Lots of fun, plays really smoothly. Bit of a resource hog, which is why four stars instead of five.",4
I keep having trouble losing my connection with Google during my PvP attacks,3
"Fun, nothing groundbreaking. Cool theme and good voices/music.",4
Like the old one but better !!!!!!!,5
This game is great.  A lot better than some others out there.,5
"Constant disconnects on wifi, and it's not a problem with my network. Very frustrating to be disconnected in the middle of every other attack.",2
"Fun game but takes a while to load anything. Loading is getting worse. Gems are disappearing as the game ""loads"" and in battles or the campaign and just gose back to home dungeon with demerits for leaving a battle.",1
I don't know what to say this game is just so fun!,5
I would give a higher rating if gems were cheaper.  Do people really spend $100 on on cell phone game?   Not me!!,1
"lots of fun, save your gems",5
I love this game it has quickly turned into my favorite game,5
Fun to play.,5
"EA have stooped to a new low with this game. I can spend $100 just mine out 56 of the hardest block in the game, Even worse than that, you've ruined the dungeon keeper series. If you've played either if the  dungeon keeper games you know what I mean. It is a shame that this game exists.",1
"This game is so much fun and addictive. Just as good, if not better than the originals that were on PC and other ports. It takes time...but with smart planning...anything is possible.  Smack those imps!!!",5
Love this game!,5
If it would stop closing on me!!! Note3.,3
Fun to see a old game rediscovered but it's all the real time based and looking for money left and right. I would rather buy a game once.,2
"Good graphics, some humor and plays just well as the original. On the down side it spends ALOT of time loading (& reloading in game) or having trouble connecting to servers",4
Awesome game concept,5
"its a good time killer,the amount of time and resources required to upgrade are fair.the only thing is i get disconnected and kicked from the app,and i cant reopen sometimes for hours sometimes for days.other than that its a fun game.",4
Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!,5
Easy to play & great graphics,5
A revitalized classic PC game. Go smack your minions around.,5
"Takes too long after first 2 upgrades of anything, unless you buy gems, of course.",4
"Very entertaining, but time consuming.something to pass by some time",5
It is so cool........ but I hate it when it updates,5
Eh...coc clone.,3
The mechanics are smooth and despite what others say the upgrades aren't outlandishly long....,4
Good game.,5
"I like the game, but every time I go to change my dungeon around the game crashes over and over making it hard to arrange set the way you want without difficulty.",2
"I'm running it on a Samsung GS2, just recently every time I try to raid it lets me get started then it sends me baxk to my dungeon. I use alot of four letter words at this point. It's super frustrating and the developers need to fix this bug. Members of my guild are experiencing the same issue. Will increase stars when this bug is fixed.",5
Luvin it,5
Would be a 5 if minions were more easily obtainable.,3
I use to play both DK and DK2.  They fell of the map for a while. Glad their back.,5
Love it,5
"Like Clash of Lords, Clash of Clans, Samurai Siege, Castle Clash... but with imps you get to slap to motivate them!",5
"Awesome graphics and sound, a nice change for the rts genre and all of the ""Coc"" clones that are everywhere.",5
Very nostalgic for me.,5
"It was great fun for a couple days, then you run out of gems and can only do 2 actions per day. I would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on gems to keep the game fun and interesting. Would gladly purchase the game for $5 to get rid of the pay/wait mechanic.",1
This is an awesome game! Love all the dark voices from the keeper!,5
Love this game!!! Great job,5
"I really like this game, loved the PC original...  If the idle timeout could be increased a bit, it would be great",4
I'm played the first task games in the computer and this reminds me so much of them.,5
devilish n fun fun fun,5
Good game but never connects anymore everything else does just not this,2
Use to own dungeon keeper 2. Just the thing to get my fix of wanting to play DK2 again.,5
Loved the pc games and this has some of those aspects. But don't care for the spending money to play.,2
Level 6 and it seems fun but it's going to be one of those games I will throw away after a certain point. I don't mind paying a bit for free games but I will not funnel tons of money into one.,3
Love it,5
Love it,5
"if only there was a truly fun dungeon to play in, and all imps, demon, and hell spawn could get along!!!!",5
Love it great game,5
Garbage cash grab.,1
Its ok,2
"Great game, fantastic dungeon builder. Only real complaint is guild tourneys, little guilds will not ever win. A suggestion is to create two brackets based on guild size, little to little; big to big.",4
Keeps getting stuck on the submit name part and takes forever to load the freaking game and whatever updates!!!!! Uggggghhhh!!!!!,2
"Unless you're willing to shell out $50 or more to outfit your dungeon, the pace becomes such that you just don't care to play anymore because you're checking in once a week to see if your builds are done. Fun otherwise, but not worth the dollars demanded by this app. Get over yourself EA.",3
Having a blast all day slapping the minions around.,5
The title is self explanatory. Thus game is awesome. It takes some time to start but other than that it keeps you coming back.,5
Love it,5
Cool fun,5
"It loads a bit slow to start up, but the quality is good, and the updates it gets have been excellent. This game is addicting and fun, after a while it starts taking longer to upgrade things but that's expected. It's easy to play without paying as long as you're semi-patient. I play about twice a day now to check on everything and slap my imps. Once you are able to join a guild the game can become very team oriented, if you're a team player join my guild Fire and Ice. We welcome devoted members &gt;:)",4
Loved this game when it was first released for PC its even better now as well as more fun,5
Fun Strategy Game with my Loving Imps,5
Classic pc game,5
Loved it,5
Entertaining. Loads of fun.,5
Loved this as the PC version. Long time ago.,5
Other than that it's a great time killer!,4
"I love this game and I am very addicted to it, the only thing that could be better is to be able to gather more gyms without paying for them, do that and it's a 5 star rating!!",4
I like this game,5
"This is a decent game (though quite dissimilar to the original) in the vein of clash of clans. Mine resources -> upgrade city (dungeon) -> generate troops -> raid -> repeat. The problem is the clan system is very rudimentary, with virtually no incentive to be very involved with clan mates. The second issue, and probably the bigger one, is the game is very buggy. Constantly pausing to load. Constantly updating. Occasionally freezing. Not sure I would really recommend it.",3
I was a fan of the original Dungeon Keepers on the PC so when I doanloaded this I was really dissapointed. But I decided to give it a try and now have been playing it almost everyday for over a month. Great job!,4
Love the app,5
"I loved the original dungeon keeper.  This game does not offer much fun for free. I despise the in-app purchase system everyone has gone to. If your not going to buy more imps you will be stuck waiting for progress more often than you get to play. The game takes forever to load also. I might have given 2 stars if it didn't take up to a minute to get into the game. Wi-Fi or cellular data, quad core phone, this is by far the slowest loading game I've played.",1
It said sorry our imps are online but than when i got on i did  the tutorial and i tried to put my name in for my dungeon and it wouldn't let me,2
Awesomely awesome so what ever you do get this game,5
Addicting,5
Issues: ‚Ä¢Bluetooth use makes the sound go slow and cracked. ‚Ä¢Regularly I am waiting for imps to fix up my dungeon - a euphemism for a time out issue that doesn't seem to be the result of my home Internet connection so much as an over-zealous policy to constantly check in with home. ‚Ä¢There is no way to destroy a building that you have created. Stupid guilds.,3
Pretty soild game is okay but still needs work,4
Hope it grows and evolves to fill the potential. Vast like anno I think if improved. Since I played the original I was hoping.... uninstall.,2
Not exactly like the original but devilishly fun so far,4
I loved the original game and now this one. Now if only EAT would re-release the original game for PC so it can be played again. They would get me to buy it.,5
So much fun!!!,5
Liked it,4
"Always on DRM means any connection problems = game problems. This DRM is pointless,  people still illegally download it. The release groups will just make a offline patch. Who suffers? Us legit downloaders.",1
Awesome,5
Addicted,5
I remember playing this game on my old computer years ago. I would rather buy the game instead of having to buy stupid gems to advance quicker.,5
Good game but build time is too long if you don't want to spend the money on gems.,4
Just to stupid you have to pay money for good things so different from the the original one,1
Fun,5
"Great spin on the build and battle genre. Not only do you decide your city layout and defences, you design the very landscape itself",5
Overall decent a lil to much like clash of clans but yet still kinda keeps the original pc feel. Played on a galaxy s4 mini,4
"Takes to long to upgrade, awesome game",4
"The best tower defense game currently available, hands down. Dark, funny, gorgeous. Polished to a level of perfection. Great job EA...this game was MADE for me :) !!!!",5
I love this game,5
Love this game.. So glad its free.. Great job,5
This game never started up for me it looks interesting but can't play it never started up so I'll just give it a one star fix this problem please,1
I like the game alot fun and easy to play,5
Like the updates wish gems where cheaper,5
"Good graphics. I'm just checking it out to see if it grows on me. I don't find myself having the urge to play this. Its not that fun but I'm only lvl3 so it may get better. Update...... I'm now level 25 this game is pretty cool, i check in once a day to collect my mining profits and to do a couple dungeon runs. my dungeon is upgraded pretty nicely now. Waiting for upgrades kind of sucks but that's every Android game these days. that's why I just do a couple runs a day but now the game wont load after the mystic screen I hope it gets fixed or I'll be PO'd",4
"This has it beat by a long shot. Has a cash shop, but you can play without relying on it at all! Two thumbs way up.",5
Love it,5
Fun,5
The best game ever,5
"This is possibly the worst ""game"" EA has ever created simply to steal money. Then again, Battlefield Hardline, amirite?",1
Decent a bit too much of a Skinner box for my taste,3
Connection keeps dropping off... If i can rate it 0 star i will,1
If you played dungeon keeper on pc you will be delighted by the little homages.  However I purchased gems to get a free imp and never got it.  ):  otherwise I would give it 5 stars.,4
You guys took one of the best pc games of ALL TIME and turned it into this piece of junk!? Why not do dk 1 and 2 in original form? This game is sloooowwwwww in so many ways and not true to original game......which was already in a best perfect format for playing on phone or tablet......very disappointed,1
Cant play on the subway undeground,1
"Evil, I like that you can earn gems on a daily basis by revenging players who attack you",4
Used to play on pc! Love this game!,5
Keeps kicking me out when I try to raid. Was good at first,2
Reminds me a lot of the computer version.,5
I absolutely love this game!,5
"I can't afford to play this ""free to play"" game.  Haven't bought an Ea game in years. Sure as hell won't be giving you another chance after this.",1
"Really addictive, funny to play, worthwhile game play",5
They need to make a next button when you are raiding someone else's dungeon instead of going back to your dungeon and starting again,4
Awesome game.,5
Have fun with it.,4
This game is a lot of fun yea,5
Really fun,5
"Waiting time sucks, but that's the norm for these games. Otherwise good stuff",4
"Hearkens back to the old glory days on the PC, playing this until late into the night. ;] The voice-over is still as excellent now as it was back then. Love the snark!",5
Fun it's my first game,5
"This program (""game"" isn't a fitting term) is shamefully bad.  Compared to the PC original, there are unbearably long delays built into nearly every single action, with purchased in-game currency the only way to expedite.  The user is even directed to the in-app purchase store within the tutorial!  It's a shame to see the high-quality PC game resurrected as this decaying, insatiable monstrosity, and I am glad indeed the publisher didn't have the gall to charge for the program before treating me this way.",1
Good game but needs improvement,3
New twist love it,5
Finally get to play this again,5
Still as fun as the pc great 2 c this game back thank u. Just out of curiosity how come we can't share attack/defend videos with clan members? I would love it if y'all made a dungeon keeper mobile app game like one of the original games,5
The minion slapping alone is worth the cost. Please add more minion abuse.,5
Screw you,1
Could have a area editor where you could remove everything and put it in a new spot. Also cut block times in half. Some are ridiculous,5
Too good to describe,5
Good game,4
When it say enter dungeon name my keyboard won't show  up take it off Google play,1
In this game you learn to build thrive and create chaos in your very own dungeon along with the help of hr a hilarious but evil person whom you meet in the beginning I recommend this app for clash of clan users or any other game like that great game so far!,5
Sweet,5
Lowered from 4 to 1. Constant connection issues lately.,1
Hours of time slip by love it,5
Awesome,5
Decent,5
New idea. Very entertaining,4
So fun and addicting,5
Fun,5
"Everything takes to long and costs too much, it's just not fun.",1
"Are you into the Dark Lord Satan? Well he's not in this, but if you liked Tim Curry in ""Legend"" you're in for a treat! It's a game of patience that's for sure. And during the tutorial I suggest you save your gems when it wants you to speed up the process. You'll be able to buy a 3rd imp faster, which will make things much faster in the long run.",4
Very addictive!,5
This has got to be one of the best phone based games out there...it's definitely worth a try!,5
Amazing!!!! better than clash of  clans by a longshot!!!!,5
Best game ever,5
It's a fun game when it works. Unfortunately I'm plagued with connection issues. I will be halfway through a successful raid when I get a connection error and I load back to my dungeon with the raid I was playing automatically failed. My minions deployed won't even finish out the round. I'd rate it better if I wasn't constantly having connection issues.,2
My 3 kids and myself all have fun playing.we enjoy the voices the silly game play and the humor that they don't catch I really enjoy. Thanks guys! Great work .,4
"From time to time it will not let me zoom in or move around, so it needs a little work but other then that its just like old times.... at least that was before I realized it takes a day to remove certain blocks and a week on others",1
Pros: - unique immortals (hero units) - thousands of possible base layouts that can be successful - nice variety of traps - buildings all do unique attacks when defending (unlike other rts games similar to this)                                                                Cons: - some build times crazy.  (4 days to get an anti air defense to level 2 is too much) -some players don't activate all access points giving them a huge advantage (  easily fixed) - a base editor mode would be fantastic to have,5
I remember this game for pc back in day glad theres a mobile version!,5
My childhood ^^,5
Best game eva,5
Nothing like the original game on pc. Get rid of the stupid wait times and will give 5 stars. And make it a identical pc port.,2
Lots of crashes.  Doesn't play as good as the original but it's still pretty fun.,3
This game requires internet connection 100% of the time. As soon as there's even interference in my signal the game closes back to the start screen and forces me to load for 2 minutes. This is very annoying since I end up spending more time loading depending on my 3g connection. The game is a little bit pay to win and takes a long time to do things later on. Otherwise an interesting idea for a tower defense concept.,2
Very fun and addicting,5
Lovely,5
Game just wish it was easier to earn Gems,4
"Not like the original as I'd hoped. Instead, its a clash of clan ripoff. Weak.",1
This game has a high fun value that makes you want to keep playing!,5
Feels like dk. Don't like payment model. Would rather play monthly not pay to win,4
Got bored halfway on tutorial.,2
The best game ever like omg im in love,5
This is a really fun app only being held back by the gem system,3
"Heavily favors attacker over defense, one star = defeat, even if your heart survives. The cost of building/upgrading your defense compared to offence is insane. Bomb wall spell vs Reinforced wall. Level 5  bombwall does 500 damage to everything in a 3x3 area. So you need a level 3 reinforced wall (100k total stone to build @ 600 def) stops 1 bombwall use. Level 6 wall (1.22mil stone @ 1050 def) Stops 2 bombs & a level 9 wall (10.72mil stone @ 1550 def) stops 3 bombs. That's just the start.",1
If you like click and wait/pay games this is for you. It's a far cry from the fun of the original series. Sad to see it's memory tarnished by this cash grab of a game.,1
"More trash from EA ...must accept our terms of blah, blah, blah.",1
Haven't stopped playing since download.,5
realy fun game,5
"I have been playing for a long time and noticed sometimes that the server speed is extremely slow to the point where tonight I have had to start the exclusive raid over again 3 times and then gave up cause it kept stopping and ""Imps getting dungeon in order"" and then it would crash and I kept spending gems to try the raid over and over...",3
Very comical,5
It seems to be a pretty good game so far. I love the notifications. I just may replace clash of clans.,5
Easy to learn and addictive...hours of fun!!,5
This is just more tapping on coins while waiting or paying for things to build.,2
Lame attempt at taking a classic and making into a in-app purchase dependant title. Waste of time for anyone familiar with the original.,1
Iiiii,5
Addicting!,5
It was about time for the return of DK,5
Its pretty cool I think there could be a little more to add but over  all I like it,4
Smooth play and addicting,5
good job,5
So far so good,4
One of the best games ive played,5
It is almost just like the original from the computer having fun so far,5
Good stuff!,4
Amazing,5
Nice twist on a proven genre.  If you like clash of clans try this. It is NOT a CoC clone and I like being the bad guy once in a while.,4
"It's kind of like clash, but with the old school dungeon keeper feel. Great job EA!",4
Great game brings back the good old days of pc games,5
Now I can't even install the game say I error code 24 I was playing the game last night and when I woke up it was gone wtf,1
Some thing that I don't mind playing during down time,4
Runs and looks great,4
Great game,4
Addictive.,5
"It says enter dungeon name, so I tipe sirlord. Nothing happens, so I cant play because I cant name.",1
Love the voice and good graphics,5
"I would pay to own the game but I won't pay for gems to speed up a 2 hour dig time. Now that rooms are leveled to 7+ it takes 12 hours to upgrade. A 12 hour upgrade costs around 150 gems to speed up, that's around a buck fifty for a single upgrade. Uninstalling, ea shouldnt be this greedy.",1
The only problem new phone I have to start over again.,5
"I really hate hopping on the bandwagon of EA hate, but this game and its near-criminal levels of micro transactions are inexcusable. Probably the worst thing to come out of this is the inflated Play Store ratings. The game baits its users into giving it a 5 star rating. The game itself doesn't excuse the buffoonery that is the pricing and overall corporate shadiness. It is lackluster at best. This game is wasted potential.",1
Barly loads and crashes,1
"Just awesome.   Only sh***y part is the whole 800 gems PER IMP!!!  COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!!!!  I'm glad this game was made for android,  and hope that O'l Horny changes his greed.  ""Hint hint""",5
Even better than the original dungeon keeper like twenty years ago! Well done! I'm gonna be stuck on this one every bit as bad as over ten years ago! Lol,5
"Raids will sometimes crash the game, which is really annoying, especially during survival raids, since they take much more resources. Also, the overlord achievement doesn't count minions made while the app isn't open   HTC ONE (M8)",4
"Great graphics, it is one hell of a game",5
Fun quick and its not a money grab,4
Since the last update the game has been more enjoyable,5
Great game.  Keeps you coming back.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  I love the time based building and upgrades.  The PvP is fun and challenging,5
"Very good so far,  the game makes it possible to make many different base combinations and overally is well thought out and fun. The idea that structures, and not defenses alone can fight is awesome. And there's no real need to waste tons of money to have fun.",5
Good game. Needs more social plugins. Hard to find good active guilds,4
There seems to be a million of this type of game out there.   It gets a little redundant,2
Constant attention to achieve your satisfaction,5
"Not bad so far, the look and feel reminds me allot of the old old pc game :-)",5
Very fun.Good graphics ready gameplay with a good strategic element,5
User fun,5
Good,5
"Great game except -2 stars for the random disconnects during raids. During which you lose by default, even if you were winning the raid. This happens too often, even with a great connection.",3
"Been having a blast with this, the build times could be a lil kinder. With all that said its a good lil battle sim with a gamers funny bone...thanks",4
Great game,5
I haven't gone all that far but its a good game.,4
It not fun,1
When I know I have full wifi capability it just say error 7 cant connect help,2
This game is awesome! Also if you like raps and this game check out Dan Bull's dongeon keeper RAP on youtube! :-),5
Looks fun,5
Sometimes slow but an awesome adaptation of the old game,5
Great game,5
Prefer this over any other game of its type,5
A shallow mock up of the original game tainted by Facebook-itis. Should be renamed to Farmville Keeper.,1
I like the game alot is really forgiving with gems,5
So far so good,3
Its good but I don't like that I have to buy new minions all the time...if they die yeah ill buy more but not if they live,3
Awesome,5
Good game,5
This is fun and addicting.. Much like clan wars yet different in many ways. Good job. We need more gems!,5
Fun,4
Love it,5
Bit slow on loading and tutorials but all in all it's good,4
"I would have gave this game five stars if it were not for one thing, its a pay to play. I hate pay to plays, but the original version of this game, and its sequel were great and definitely deserved a remake.",3
Beautiful game very fun. A good way to kill time. Will keep you entertained for hours.,5
And there's this phoned in garbage. Ditch it.,1
Which means its a great idea ruined by their greed. Which can be seen with every watered down game franchise they own. C&C comes to mind.....,1
It's a fun game it does a wonderful job of paying homage to the original game,4
"Reminds me of dk1 a lot, I enjoyed it",5
:D,5
Game,5
Just lije old times,5
Suck doesn't even load,1
"I have been an avid player of this game. I have two major complaints. One, why does it talk so long to boot up. It signs me in then re signs me in then I have to wait for it to load... this is ridiculous that it more than 2 mins. Just to play. Number two. Once it boots up and loads if there is a hickup in the internet it shuts down and has to re-log in and go through the boot process... is there a way to make it off line at least for maps. If I want to to slap my minions or to bld something I can'tw/o net",1
Its like the original...loved it,5
Really good reminds me of the old one just wish it was easier to get imps without gems,5
"Reminds me of the old PC version, sans heroes.",4
Great way to waste time. Unfortunately the devs insist on the Pay to Play format that forces you to either pay or wait days between playing.,3
"True to the spirit of the epic original, but without a true rts feel",4
This game is amazing. I love it all.,5
Very much a Pay to Play game,1
Kinda like that game But with an evil twist. Sometimes even better.,5
No problems with it so far,5
Frigging selfishly good game.,5
This game ruins the dungeon keeper franchise.,1
Would have been an awesome game if it wasn't so well EA'd.,2
The title says it,5
Awesome. Create a kingdom battle and have a lot of fun. Set up traps and trick your enemies. Never had so much fun its easy,5
Fun I enjoy it,5
Love this game used to play it back in the day on my pc and im super excited to play it now,5
It stops loading at the loading screen,1
So this is a great game the only thing that I think should be changed is that you lose all your troops weather or not they die or survive only thing I dont like should be able to keep your troops if they dont die I would give five stars if that is changed other then that awesome game!!!,4
I have always loved DK ever since it first came out. Now I get the chance to play it again. Awesome!,5
"Guess my new ota update made my phone  incompatible with this game that once worked fine on my LGF6... frequently force closings, stops and reconnecting errors.",2
"Sure it's fun at first, but eventually you get to a point where you'll have to wait at least a week, and that's not an exaggeration, to do anything else. That is, unless you pay real life money for those fancy gems.",2
Couldn't ask for more,5
This game is pretty good.,5
I have a galaxy s2. The server keeps disconnecting me and my guild members and disrupting game play as of several updates ago. I've lost countless gems and win streaks and I finally had to give up. I love the game but the developers have ignored this for way too long. I uninstalled today.,1
I am enjoying building my dungeon and stocking it with monsters and traps as well as raiding other dungeons. The only complaint I have is that it takes gems to get more imp workers and gems are not plentiful.,5
"It definitely seems like a cool game but honestly, I'm tired of sitting there waiting for the game to take 10 to 15 minutes to patch itself every time I try to play. Uninstalling til it gets better. Gave it a chance, at least.",3
Awesome game so far,5
PAY. TO PLAY,3
A lot of fun,5
"I'm getting sick of getting booted out of other players dungeons and losing my win streak, trophies, and any minions that I had summoned before my minions randomly decided to get my ""dungeon in order"". I've told EA about the problem but they obviously do not care...",1
But buggy as hell. So unfinished that EA published it XD,3
"A very different kind of game than either Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2, expect an app when you download. Expect to have to wait hours and then days for upgrades to complete. The Dungeon Keeper App is designed to be an addiction that tempts you into spending money - and not just five dollars.  One can easily invest a hundred dollars just to unlock your full scale of imps and skip some tedious wait times.",3
"similar in concept as Clash of Clans but does not run smoothly at all, and if you open mines up early you have no chance at top defense, restructuring design is futile as space is limited so much, save your time.",2
"Fun, keeps you busy",5
"Game randomly disconnects whenever I raid or just try to modify my dungeon, no reason why, my internet is stable so its the app itself, so after I expend my forces, tbeyre lost and I have to remake",1
I normally dislike EA because they are an Evil corporation that makes boring games. Only... they can't mess up the Bullfrog classic... even with pricy temporary boosts in a micropurchase game. Perhaps being Evil finally paid off for them. You've killed many of my favorites... keep up the good (Evil) work with this one and I'll forget the past.,5
"The app is fun, but it penalizes the player if it disconnects during a raid.... incredibly frustrating",3
"The game is super entertaining, but it always chooses to lose connection when I'm attacking someone,  and instead of picking up when I left off when it reconnects, it acts as if I had retreated voluntarily, with the consequent UNINTENTIONAL  loss of resources. Very frustrating! Also, if you don't put money into the game, you get constantly crushed by players who do. I already have a job to feel that way, I don't need it in my free time too.",1
"Gave this game 1 star because there is no way to reset your dungeon and start over without trashing all the stuff you bought with real money like imps, gems, and immortals. I imagine because of that I will get sick of my dungeon layout sooner or later and quit playing",1
Too many things use stones and not enough things use gold. I always have full gold and just fighting for stones,3
fun.,4
Tp,3
The fact that you guys so clearly designed this game just for money is a shame,1
Fun game for sure,5
Fun,5
"The game looks fun, and I really want to play a dungeon keeper game.  But, the game loses connection all the time even on WiFi.  This results in the game ""forgetting"" you had 100 more gems and resetting you and never giving them back.  Maybe if this was sorted out I'd give it another try.  But I'd stay away from this one until it's fixed.  It's just going to frustrate you.",1
No clear way to undo or restart is pretty lame,2
Best tower defense game on the market! So many possibilities for deviousness with dungeon design. Updates are doing a great job of balancing the game and the community forums are quite active.,5
I crab needs way to much money,1
Supe fun! And addicting...,5
I love it,5
"Nice game but drain the battery too much!! And i start to get tired of a game that after spend real money in purchase gems, then half of the times that u are matching other players the connection with the server get interrupt and u lose points and resources eventi if u r winning.... It is frustrating.... Fix it please",2
"Sure sure, it's got expensive in app time saving purchases.  But you don't need that to have fun.",5
Super fun game!!!,5
This game sucks the way ea made it an in app purchase time consuming waste.  The original was awesome and wasn't just this stupid pvp bs where whoever wastes the most money and time on it wins.,1
"This game is really fun, and a comedically evil alternative to all the ""Clash"" games and their copies.  Gameplay and strategy are fun, balanced, and well paced. Sound and voice acting are well polished; EA made an effort where they couldve gotten away with less, though you'll probably turn then sound off after the same handful of phrases get old.  My only complaints are you have no numerical gauge of how fast actions will level you up, and open you to stronger enemies; and you cant undo completed actions.",4
Great game and lots of fun.   If u are a new player looking for support and want to be active join the Guild named Iowa.  We're lots of skilled and accepting players.  We'll help you learn and have fun.,5
Not a bad way to kill time.,3
This is a great game! It's a lot like clash of clans.,5
Good game.. have to pay to play though. Keeps reconnecting during battles and you automatically lose..have full bars and 2 feet from wifi router.. very annoying. . Fun idea for a game though.,2
I loved the PC games and am thrilled to be able to play a DK game again. It would be nice if you could download the wallpaper through the app store instead of through the app itself.,4
In app purchases ruin the game,1
Fun game,5
So far this game is a lot of fun,5
Very entertaining and creepy,5
Have always loved this game.  So glad it's now available in the play store!,5
Rating manipulation sucks!,1
"So on a first pass with this update I have decided to give dungeon keeper mobile an added star to my original rating (bringing it to two stars) purely for Mythic putting an effort into giving people ways of earning premium currency through natural gameplay. That they managed to make the game playable in spite of the tollboothing still existing is commendable, but so long as the tollbooth exists this is the best they can get off me. Waiting to see who inherits this thing post-mythic.",3
I enjoy it but the enforced downtime is annoying.  Also I would prefer for it to support multiple accounts so that my kids wouldn't ruin my dungeon.,3
Keeps me interested.   Good game.,5
Great,5
Great game.,5
Just beautiful,5
Takes good old dungeon keeper and makes it a microtransaction mess.,2
This game is so great for people with time and money to burn.  The best part is the option to spend money on in-game currency so everything doesn't literally take hours and hours. I only gave it 5 stars so that this review will actually get posted to the play store.  I bought 5 bucks worth of gems and burned through them in no time with nothing but a couple upgraded rooms and the starting stages of a tunnel to show for it. Any potential for an awesome game is ruined by EA monetizing it to death. Shame.,5
"Just started the game, love it. It is very easy for new players to get the hang of it. While keeping the feel of a challenging game.",4
This app is perfect,5
"SINCE MOST RECENT UPDATE, I CAN NOT EVEN GET THROUGH ONE RAID WITHOUT GETTING KICKED OFF THE SERVER. IT TAKES MY GOLD, IT USES THE CREATURES SO THAT THEY ARE GONE, BUT I LOOSE EVERY TIME BECAUSE OF THE DISCONNECT. FIX IT, I WILL FIX THIS RATING.",1
The micro transaction really bring this game down,1
This game is nothing more than a cash in on an old title.  It also follows the Pay to Win and Free to Wait mentality.,1
Awesome,5
"So much fun, easy to learn so addictive.:-)",5
Badass,5
This game is awesome,5
I played the original version of this game on pc but now that i can play it when ever pffft im mind blown i normally dont like games like this but this is a huge exception.,5
Looking for active players. Come join up,5
Awesome,5
Fun but not nearly as wickedly entertaining as the original.,3
Like it allot. I can finally play this game again. Loved it on the PC games.,4
"EA has done it again. This is another great game, well designed and easy, without being simplistic. I wish the in-game purchases were cheaper, but it's not extravagant. Good work, EA MYTHIC.",5
This sucks I spend a lot of time doing that,1
Love it...!!!,5
"I was excited to see this game, but it doesn't live up to the promise. Imps cost far too much and it takes far too long to get gems enough to buy more. There's no fun waiting 24 hours to mine gems and still not have enough to get more imps. Uninstalling and finding something else to play.",2
Great that they finally brought Dungeon Keeper to the tablet. Lots of fun but you have to spend lots of money if you want to play more than a short game every one in awhile. Would give more stars if it wasn't so focused on pay to play.,3
Thanks Mythic.  Great job building a great game.,5
Cannot connect to server -_-,1
"Fun, fun, fun!",5
I love this app but can you give us more minions,5
Not a bad game at all. Some mechanic issues but they seem to get worked out fast.,4
"When I first heard about this game everyone was saying you need to pay actual money to play so I was reluctant to download at first, but when I did I made the best choice of my life!!!",5
...only swipier!!!,5
I was addicted to the old PC games 1&2 . This is almost as cool as it used to be. A fun little time waster,5
Cool game,5
fun no brainer,4
Nostalgia is a wonderful thing.,4
"Game has always had glitches, but its at an all time high now. Cant raid, cant dig, cant do much at all. Was tolerable when one complete raid was possible but now its a joke, and its treated as a joke. Just look at the forums concerning connection issues.",2
Was good liked the game,4
Not an actual game in my opinion. It pushes the micro transactions pretty hard and isn't all that fun. Hardly resembles the original game if that's what you're looking for.,1
Always loved this game for pc,5
Nice,5
Nice re-boot of a classic but they want too much real money to get things done.,4
Its a very good game,5
"It was a great PC game. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the realization that I'm going to have to pay to play at some point.  I realize the point is to make money, but I would rather put up with a small ad than the constant demand for gems",4
"Great game for when Clash of Clans stalls out. I find myself playing DK more than CoC now.  Join our guild, everyone is welcome!  THE IMMORTAL DUNGEON MASTERS",5
Great game. I just enjoy killing peeps with wizards.,5
"Although I don't like the games that I have to wait five, ten minutes or an hour for buildings to complete, this makes it worthwhile. It's not the same game for those who played the original games on PC, but who doesn't like little side projects of evil? Definitely worth your time.",4
EA made a great game into a typical Facebook or Android pay to play title. If you are looking for the spiritual successor to dungeon keeper try War for the Overworld.,1
Amazing game!!!,5
For the past few days I try to connect and it says error cannot to server. Otherwise good game pc version is sooo much better but will give better rating if server issue can get fixed.,2
So far it is a blast,5
The F2P model ruins it for me,1
"A little unstable on the phone, but works great on the tablet. Really fun game",4
"In all actuality,  the game is about a 3, the developer is a 1. You can't post on his message boards that I have found,  it is just for him so I will do my griping here. As you get to higher levels,  he seems to keep backing off on what the game will do. You attain achievements,  developer takes them away. Don't get the dragon,  Tiny. It was awesome in the beginning, but the developer made him useless.  Waste of money if you spend money on these games.  Go buy a real game for 60 bucks and keep it forever.",2
I just love it. The ringtone just my favorite. Great game,5
"While not quite up to the same type of game play as the original games, I have found this to be a main daily must play. From the imp motivation, to the enlightening quips from H very enjoyable. My only complaint would be mid raid signal loss causing havoc on stats.",5
"Just wish it had a bit more space with more rooms, traps & troops ;) otherwise an amazing game!!",4
quite fun,4
Sick,5
"Takes the look and feel of the classic PC Dungeon Keeper game and modifies it into a modern mobile Clash of Clans style gameplay experience... but with a lot more style and humour. Whoever pitched this idea should get a raise! Takes a bit of patience at first until you grasp all the concepts and understand that you will be slowly building up your dungeon over days and weeks.  Update: R.I.P. Mythic! I am uninstalling this game out of respect for the employees of Mythic Entertainment who lost their jobs today (May 29, 2014) when their company was shut down by Electronic Arts.",5
"I think its better than clash of clans. I hate how EA had to close Mythic, and they had so much potential if they were just given the chance",5
It's a very fun game but it seems to disconnect at least once every time I play it and the load time seems long compared to other games. The characters that can fly over and bomb from above ruin the concept of it being a dungeon game.,3
Love it,5
Great game,5
Anyone who is looking for something with dark humor done right or an addictive builder app with good pvp just found it!,5
Let's see how far I can get without spending any cash,5
It worked for a while then quit working ...,1
Fun and entertaining.,5
"Trolls are not going to the nearest build, but instead go through the buildings towards traps",1
Awesome game.   Best tablet game I've played out of dozens.   Wish I'd found it sooner!,5
fun as hel....oh now i get it,5
Loved this game but by the time i got to level5 dungeon i spend almost as much time reloading the game as i do playing it! Makes me sad because it was a very fun game! But with the crashes it is just unplayable!,1
Every time they patch this game I want to play less and less. I don't understand the matching at all anymore.,2
The staff keeps changing the attack rules of the minions. I am tired of their changing of the game every other week.  I hope no one is dumb enough to spend money to play this incomplete piece of trash.,1
Love it,5
The game is fine...I only have a few minutes at a time to play so the model actually kind of works for me.  Changed to one star after the last update.  Constantly disconnecting.  I haven't been able to complete my last 5 survival raids because I keep getting booted out.,1
Very fun,5
Used to play it back in the day. Freakin awesome :),5
"Very good, im hooked.",5
I was enjoying this game until it kept constantly and consistently crashing.,1
"Great fun but if you are impatient and want to be powerful, you need to buy gems to upgrade... The game can be played without spending tho... Join my guild: Tormented Souls and I will help you out to get started!",5
Got a new phone.. haven't figured out how to transfer over my old game and there is no info on it.,1
"Yes, there is an option to pay. No, you don't have to buy anything! Just play casually. Remember when your timer for whatever you're upgrading is done & come back then. How do you think these games are made? Should the dev get paid for making something that gives you hours/days/months of enjoyment OR should they all work hard, create updated content, test it all & give it away for free from the goodness of their hearts?! Ridiculous that people still whine about in-game purchases. Works great on Note3 & Tab4",5
Good time waster!,4
Great game really fun and entertaining,5
I like everything about this game except for the guild...!!!,4
"With every new special offer. Screen loads black, sometimes locks up the phone so bad I Jane to reboot. Not good.",2
Constantly cannot connect to server.,2
"Game is fun and enjoy playing it but since this new update I can't even raid. Opening a raid gets to the loading screen, then shuts down the game. Not much fun anymore just building a dungeon but can't raid anybody...",3
"Fun, but every event raid somehow disconnects from the server. This has happened four times in a row and is very frustrating!",4
Amazing game amazing features! Amazing!,5
10/10 would chin again,5
"Prepare to empty your wallets for aggressive micro transactions. Though some sort of kudos is in order for using the original voice actor for the Horned Reaper, he is just used as a tool by EA to reel in players in the name of nostalgia. If you're looking for a gameplay experience similar to the original Dungeon Keeper, you will find no such thing here.",1
"A decent game, but trouble comes in with trophies.  It tells you how much you should get for winning, but only gives you a tenth of what you should.  This needs fixing.",3
I don't know what these other people are complaining about.  I'm gaining gems easily and haven't spent a dime. And getting raided doesn't  wipe you out like most games.  I really like this game. It's fun to play. It's a strategy game that you have to learn to get good at.,5
Game looks awesome game play same as original but loses connection and makes stats fall every time instead of resetting so you can replay. Getting to point there's no reason to play if server connection goes out every time you to battle.,2
"If you don't mind being bug to play in your message alerts the get this game, but if you do don't get it.  I tried finding an option to turn it off and because it doesn't have one, it is getting removed.",1
I give it a 3 because it's fun but the old pc version was way better but this is a good job of scaling that original down to a app game.,3
"I hate that I cannot use my galaxy note 2 pen, and I hate that others take all your resources unless you pay real money for gems",3
"Fantastic premise, amusing characters (and caricatures) and horrible Pay-to-Play trickery.  There is no option to opt out and pay a full (decent) price for a game without artificial pay walls and psychological chicanery.",1
Brings me back. Awesome.,5
Fun game....,4
Not quite like the originals though but still fun,5
The microtransactions actions make this game torture. The original creator has even called this game ridiculous. Boo on you EA for skewing  your Google Play ratings by not logging reviews from customers that give this less than 5 stars from within the game.,1
Keep getting disconnected while playing or taking a dungeon heart. This game I keep getting disconnected.,3
I enjoyed this on my pc years ago,5
"Now whenever I try to talk in guild chat, it reboots. Whenever I try to raid, it reboots. Whenever I try to revenge raid, it reboots. Whenever I try to campaign, it reboots. Whenever I try to event raid, it reboots. The only thing I can do is build and defend from raids, so now I serve as an in game punching bag for the masses. I don't have this problem with any of my other game apps, and this game used to be soon much fun before the update for me. Uninstalling, it was a good run while it lasted.",1
This is not DK,1
wow talk about pay to win bullshit. I was semi-skeptical about how pay to win until I tried this game. Seriously. The first thing that it barrages you with is spend premium currency! Do it! SPEND IT!!,1
I think its a fun app. Its more of an app that you have to use your brain but its great.,4
A disgrace to the DK titles,1
Addicting.,5
"Love the game. But keeps crashing after most recent update. Please fix the problem,  my minions need guidance!",4
If u like Clash of Clans try out Dungeon Keeper,5
Build times are a bit much. And it takes to long to get resources ifyou dontspend money.,3
I really like this game and play on the wifes ipad...I would like to play more but there's no way to transfer my dungeon to my phone since I have it more frequently,4
words can't describe how much I love this game this game is awesome I wish there were more games like this,5
Hell ya,5
Typical f2p ea garbage. Times on everything are ridiculous to make you buy the game currency. Don't be another sucker for each to cash in on,1
"Pretty fun to play, and I get to pass the time with it! If I wanted to play more often then I might like to be able to obtain more gems through raids and lower the price of emp's a little, but other than that I like the game!",4
Worth the time especially when you get all your monsters and raid other players dungeons.,5
Why are the minions unable to tell that something is under attack and just stand still?,3
Fun 2 burden of a few minutes each day,4
I can play now and it's funner than clash of clans and caste clash etc.,5
It would be nice if build/upgrade times were cut in half...some are ridiculous. It would also be nice if we could sell back rooms we decide we no longer want (quarries).,4
Great app!,5
It is a cash grab game like Clash of Clans BUT like Clash of Clans you can be great without the gems to rush every building.,4
"Socialism aspect of game is too pervasive.  Nickel-and- dimey...Buttons are placed so as to easily waste gems (real life cash), and it can happen if your device or connection hit a bit of lag.  Fix these things and it might be great.",4
"About to uninstall like 20% of my guild as the disco-nnects and other glitches are making the game completely unplayable.  Pretty bad when the word disconnect displays as a swear word in guild chat ea.  I've lost streaks, resupply  gems,  and trophies. Get better app dev qa!!!!!!",1
It takes a while to get buildings and level up,4
"A little different than when I was a kid, but it works!",5
Love it!,5
Game can be as expensive as you want it to be but it is really fun. My favorite game right now.,5
"How very disappointing, yet typical of the mighty EA.  For those unaware, Dungeon Keeper WAS once a GREAT game, when it was on pc long ago. If you have never played it I highly recommend digging up a copy.      This version, on the other hand is a lesson in how to use the good name of an ip and twist it into a pale and shallow money pit. Twisted and perverted by the greed of a so called triple A publisher, they have stripped this formerly great title of the best elements at its heart.            Gone is the control of your minions, the range of customization, and the true depth of rts joy that made this an enjoyable title.  Instead of happily spending hours designing and building you dungeon in devious bliss to fend off the ever encroaching heroes, you now look forward to hours or even days to carve out a single block. 4h wait time for a block with gems, a dense gem block 1 full day, absolutely sickening.  I'm used to the f2p model, and have no problem with paying for games that are worth it, but this is the worst I've seen in 20yrs of gaming.         Do yourself a favor and pass on this example of corporate greed, and go pick up the old pc game. You will love it. Shame on you EA!",1
"The PC game is better, but good port over to android.  I miss the hero gate. Bad that it tries to force you to use google+. The mistress in the PC game looks better. Still a fun game. Trophy levels similar to clash of clans. Guild and PVP play.",4
Was fun until last update. Now I'm constantly getting disconnected and having raids count as loses even if I was winning.  Also tournaments are one sided. If your not planning on spending cash for gems you wont even rank in top 3.,1
"Perfect mix of tower defense and realtime strategy. I just wish you had to do more picking and choosing of which buildings you use, instead of just getting them all.",5
Pretty good game that you don't have to pay to play/win.,4
"Nice,had to give 5 stars so i can comment ,the new update today is lame   That was the last straw with that update,and to think i paid lots of money all ready for gems. I'm sure many more will quit after they see that new update. And now just noticed reinforced walls now can be bombed or dug through on less you spend 50k on first upgrade each and then 70k on next upgrade and it keeps going up ,each update gets worse and worse for the consumer and better for ea to milk more money.  Don't bother with this game , every new update makes them more money and game play even longer. It kills me it takes 5 min to 12 min to summon minions but 2 to 3 hrs to regain your mana ? On less you of course buy gems to speed up . Can it be any more obvious  on EA's goal here ? Who has this kind of time ? If you log out to play later then your gold and stone get raped because reinforced walls are useless on less you can spend 300k or more per block. You know how long it takes to even get half that and having to wait 3 Fn. Hrs in between each raid for mana regen . Something has gotta be done with these company's its getting out of control now.",1
"Join a guild and dominate your enemies, not as good as the original, but optimized for phones and tablets",4
Real connection issues that cause you to lose raids and ultimately set you back in progress.  Has potential but needs a lot of tweaking still.,2
"Love this hasn't, perfect for a cell phone",5
U really dont need to buy gems u start with a few hundred and the in game achievements give u well over enough to speed things up buy boost imps immortals and so fourth its a real time game people more familiar with emross war will be more patient so if u dont like to destroy stuff and lame jokes dont download over all great gamey wife even plays awesome join # number one player killers #1pk,4
Pretty fun once you get the hang of it.,4
"Much enjoyment, try it and youll be hooked!",5
Won't load past the searching for updates page.,1
The game stole a couple hundred dollars from my cc. It said the transaction couldn't be processed at the time and took the money off my card.,1
I can't even play anymore due to the constant disconnects every few seconds most I get now is a glimpse of my dungeon before it kicks back to the loading screen. It never connects even on WiFi... WTF - fix this and then quit f-ing with the programming or give me my money back. Months of playing wasted...,1
"I enjoy this game as a minor distraction, but it suffers from having an end goal or any storyline.  Endless building without a way to destroy anything but walls. You are stuck with whatever decisions you make learning the game.  Not a game for those without means to pay. Free to play = pay to win.  Great animation sound runs smooth on nexus 7&5, but takes forever to load. Wish they would take engine or style of this game and make it fun.  A lot of great voicework and sound design.",4
"Don't think good games exist on mobile, low expectations with the ea tag and they were met. Aparently you can rate this through the app, but it only registers the 5 star ratings. Enjoy.",1
Game is fun! I get they need revenue but its far too focused on making money off players.,4
Need to buy stuff to stay interested.,4
I thoroughly enjoy this game! I know it's not like the original and it is kind of a money hungry beast if you are impatient. But it is still a fun game! If you are interested in joining a guild mine has openings still and there is plenty of opportunities for growth and promotions!! Join Dantes Minions and join me (Dantes Inferno)!!!!,5
Lots of fun!,5
"Deongeons,rooms,battles,and more!I love this game.oh, totally awesome minions.",5
"Would love to babe an emulator of the old game, not this pay to play crap.",2
"Paid for max imps & gems to build dungeon. Ran into some bugs, most were fixed. Suffered much death by an interupting LOADING screan on my old HTC EVO4G LTE. Recently picked up the HTC ONE. I guess the problem was my old evo. It plays gloriously my new one. Since no more glitches, & with their continued fine tuning, this is again my favorite :]",5
I like it but it crashes a lot,3
"This game is what I was expecting it to be. Then again, maybe not. I expected it to not be as good as the original DK, so no disappointment there. The thing I enjoy about games I've been recently playing is that I'm not required to sit there and play the entire time in order to progress. This may have come across me at the right time because of this.  I give it a 4 because some mining takes ridiculously long and it's just not enough interactivity between the keeper and his minions....",4
If the game didnt turn off every 30 seconds it would be great.,1
Good game but need deals and imps,5
One of the best defense games...1 thing...fix the glitches...to many times im raiding a dungeon and get timed out...,5
This is so fun because you get to play with a lot of people.,5
"This game is simply a cheap money grab. All upgrades either take literally days at a certain points, or cost a small fortune. A very disappointing remake.  My life has improved significantly since uninstalling this weeks ago.",1
Awesome!!!,5
Its nice game,4
"Very bad, especially how it is monetized. Would give 0 stars if possible.",1
Fix the disconnects!!! Everyone gets disconnected from the game ever second. Cant even load a raid!!! This sucks!! This has been going on for over a month!!!,1
Game kept crashing on me didn't even make it through the tutorial.,1
"I wanna give at least a 4 star, but since I had to re upload, it keeps throwing a error code 15. Been doing it for 24hrs now, & I really would like to play. Please fix.",3
'Nuff said,5
Fun game,4
Good,5
Its fun when you can actually play it.  I can't even do a single raid without it dropping connection.  The last update ruined the game completely.  Its not even playable.  Its a good game so EA if you actually care about your customers please fix this!,1
Last patch screwd up matchmaking badly. Constant attacks by way more advanced players cannot be defended.,1
"For a game made by EA it rather pathetic, Clash of Clans is ten times better or Castle Crashers. Don't get me wrong the concept of the game is awesome but the way they made the game is like they took ideas from other games and through in a demonic tone to it and decided to throw it out there to see how many suckers like me will waste their time and money on this game.",1
I downloaded this hoping to play the dungeon keeper of old but instead I find a clash of clans clone with much worse greed. The game should be playable without having to buy anything or you shouldn't make it free.,2
This gake is adictive. Itsa hard to get off of,5
Lowered to 1 star because of the incredible lag after the last patch. I play on my galaxy tab 3 and i I can't do anything without it losing connection. Please fix!,1
"Fun game but it constantly crashes during raids, and sometimes while you're just working on your dungeon.  constant crashing is ruining the game experience for me.",2
One of the best unique games I loved from long ago has come back!,5
Love it,5
best remake of any old and school Maurer peice,5
Good game =D,5
Different twist on Clash of Clans type game. Good experience and original ideas.,4
Seems like if you want to play game you better buy a lot of gems to by Imp's and boost.  Cause when you play others they will kill you fast.  Take your gold and stone which you can never  get enough. It is fun only to certain point...,2
The best game ever,5
Easy game Play and fun Guild / raid system.,5
"Remembered the original dungeon keeper.  Did an excellent android conversion.  Enjoying very much.    That being said, constant dc's hinder the game massively, and unlike some other similar games, once it dc's, you've lost, instantly, and lose your troops, and wasted your time... Come on EA, fix that crap!  -1 star for that.",4
Awesomeness!,5
"It's kinda fun, but it's an insult to the original. You won't have to keep your minions happy or stop then from eating each other, you won't have to make sure the library is far enough from the hatchery, you won't have to expand your dungeon much.  Instead, you'll be bored with slow mining and construction that you can speed up by spending real money. It's a sad fate for what was once a brilliant game, but I'll still play it for the sake of nostalgia.",2
"My experience has gotten progressively worse over time. Don't expect to make any real progress unless you spend 100s of dollars  Almost everything in this game is broken:  PvP matching isn't close to fair. Everything costs too much and takes too long. Revenge doesn't work because the other player is almost guaranteed to be online or have cave in status. Push notifications only work sometimes. Game is slow to load, matching is slow as well. Game updates either completely change the game or make things worse.",1
"If you remember the originals. Don't even waste your time. Not worth it. Horrible. I've been waiting for years for someone to remake this game, and when they finally have it was the biggest disappointment ever.",1
Doesn't feel like an accurate representation of the original work by Bullfrog Studios,2
"Great game but progression is so slowed after the first few hours that its almost unplayable. This can be cured of course with iaps, but the costs are ridiculously high.",3
Epic,5
This is a very fun game. You don't have to spend real money to enjoy it but it doesn't hurt either.,5
Good game . . . But this is why we cant have nice things,4
Awesome as hell,5
I havnt played this game since i started out on the pc.,5
Game was fun before but now if you don't buy gems you will not get very far and get steamrolled more often than not.  If you are considering downloading don't waste your time as you will have your @$$handed to you regularly if you aren't wanting to spend a small fortune in gems to get a decent defense in place.  Even then you will get pillaged routinely as you try to catch up but you never will.  Good luck if you try but don't say I didn't warn you.,2
I really loke the concept of this game looks like fun,5
Addictive and fun. Runs great!,5
E r  bets d b hh,4
Good so far,4
This game is amazing but nothing like the real game. Every game now is so focused on making money it really destroys what little loyalty us gamers have to the title.,3
I LOVE IT I played dk2 years ago and its just like it but in a new way love it love it love it,5
A really good app to waste time,5
Pay or wait,1
Join bearded red dragons,4
This game is easy,5
Cool stuff,5
Love this game. No problems on the Samsung g4... 5/16 ported to the s5. No problems. 5/17 ported to galaxy tab 3. Still no issues.,5
Love both of the pc games. .  Figured I'd try this out too.. not the same but great,5
Save your gems! Dont waste them on expanding your dungeon. Not worth buying gems either. Spend them on buying Imps 1st!,4
Imps on perma 4+ day tasks.,2
Fun keeps me entertained,4
"Fun game,  not quite like the original but great time killer",5
takes a while to get into.  not at all like the PC version.,4
Love it!!,5
Very good game,5
I love the game and everything...but ever sincw the last patch I haven't been able to get past the first screen...please please fix this.,3
Monetary (voluntary) investment isn't too bad.  Abuse potential is very expensive to exploit.,4
My sister recommended this game to me and I'm very glad she did. It's very tactical. Set up your dungeon and traps however you like. DOES NOT require any real money to get ahead. Just time which is easy for me to do with a mobile pick up and play game then exit to come back later. The guild system is easy peazy as you just click join and you're in and there's no pressure and no need to do much. 5 star rating in my books.,5
Fun &  great way to pass the time.,5
A helluva lot better than Clash of Clans.,4
"The game is fun and the graphics/sound are good, but it throttles you significantly (without paying) taking months to build up dungeons.",4
Its a fun game to play to pass time.,4
Pleasantly addicting.,5
Been playing dungeon keeper since it first came out in the late 90s and still am not disappointed,5
Please reduce load times and improve performance. The wait time when skipping a player is too long and the time from end of attack until your back in your dungeon is too long. Clash of clans does not have slow load speeds.,3
Download and then rate it! !! You will love it i pro mise You!!,5
Takes me back lol way back :-D,5
"IAP sucks, Dk is fun though",5
"Fun game, but the time it take to load prevents me from playing as much as I want to.",3
Its hard to gain trophies and trolls are stupid now. terrible EA.,1
Just wish you could restart or reset your game. Made a few mistakes early on and have to deal with them now,4
"This game has almost nothing to do with real Dungeon Keeper. It‚Äôs one of those pay-to-play games by EA. Take you forever to do anything in the game unless you are willing to pump some $$$ into the game. And because the game was created by EA, it‚Äôs constantly changing, never for good. Developers keep fixing this game almost every day, but they fix one thing and break the other. Most of the players I talk to are not happy. Many people quit after ever terrible update by EA.  DON‚ÄôT INSTALL  ---- DON‚ÄôT SPEND ANY MONEY ON IT!!!!!",1
See subject,5
"Fun, love the guys voice,easy to play",5
Minus the micro transactions great Game!,4
The game is fun if slow. It consistently loads in the middle of raids causing you to waste all the resources involved for no reward. Very pay to win. Tasks take forever.,2
,4
Totally addicting! Have had no problems at all!,5
"Great game. Never has a game held my attention as this one has. It is not a pay to play, and not even a pay to win to an extent, but it is definitely a pay to be at the top of the leaderboards. Nonetheless, if your are concidering playing it, then you must. Don't miss out on all the fun!",5
"When i heard forever ago that there would be a new dungeon keeper, i was pumped. I was ready for a new pc game with all new levels. This is s*** in comparison. So unhappy. I thought id try it out and was sorely disappointed. Not what i would have expected from ea taking over such an amazing game. You ran it into the ground.",1
"Um. Yeah. How about that? When I'm in a daily challenge for and for some reason get kicked off your servers and automatically lose? Not cool.   Also, when I'm in one of the single player events and the same thing happens? Also not cool. Way not cool.",2
Good game,4
Love the game play all day got far far then bam. Imps won't do anything can't change my rooms around. This blows.,1
Clash of Clans who??,5
"This is more of a review of the games stability and lofty pay to pay scale. I'm cool with pay to pay to a point but again EA shows us what's important to them, their bottom $ line and not the gamers. Let me stress I'm cool paying for a game because it's a product that someone produces. My issue is the scale of $ to gain for a mobile game that is pretty but lacks consequences for multiplayer play. So this is a comment on the ""free to pay"" err I mean ""free to play"" model. AND THE GAME DISCONNECTS ALL THE TIME",2
It's an impressive little game - a little nurfed but once you get past that not bad.. not the same as the original.. but not bad,4
Very very poor loading and connection.. been playing for months..spend half the time loading..stops in the middle of raids all the time,2
I just wish they would allow their to be a leader and a co leader in the guilds.,5
"The bomb wall spell is just plain ridiculous... Really? blowing up a 5x5 square? And flying units in a dungeon? Where's the logic in that exactly? Also, matchmaking is terribly messed up. They constantly change the calculations on how players are matched, resulting in people stuck in various leagues in which they don't belong. Other than that, its quite fun to design your own unique dungeon. Defending and raiding are fun to a certain extent.",3
love this game.,5
Great so far. About to try the new update we shall see!! Love it even though most proiles are hacks and u will never be as good as them without one,5
It cant be beat! love the demonic adult humor as well,5
"For a game from EA, fewer crashes and bugs would seem to be expected.  Goals and RAIDS! are constantly undermined by this app`s buggy play.",1
Thisll do.,5
Join my guild! Lords of Gore!,4
Awesome can't wait to get home from work to play,5
"This is a fantastic casual game with some RTS aspects. Free to play with no annoying ads. There are in app purchases, but this is one of the few games where you can truly play and enjoy without ever making a purchase. I wish more developers build games like this.",5
"Everytime I try to play I use so my minions in a raid/attack on another dungeon and it always says wait while we get it in order. To lose everything I just sent in and have to retrain etc. Mana gone, and anything else. In a 4g area with WiFi! What's the point in playing?",2
"Well let's try it :) take my rating down, EA. Do it.",1
Decent time killer.  Poor balance between resources.,3
Fun time killer,5
"I was a huge fan of dk1&2 when I was younger.  I should have listened to reviews and steered clear of this.  My mistake.  Spent $ to get my imps and be competitive. Played 3 months and had very few issues (hence 2 stars instead of 1). 1 day I accidentally click on a tile that is a mine entrance and didn't cancel fast enough.  I cannot close it and I'm now 1 accidental click from useless dungeon.  All support says is ""patch 1 month ago forbids this so too bad, deal"". Bad coding +absolutes in service=BAD GAME",2
Too many micro transactions and pay to win.,3
This is a great game,5
Takes a long time.... Seems pay to win,4
Don't understand why there are so many morning 40 meg patches.,4
Love this game!,5
My campaign raids are bugged. The last few raids have disappeared from the list.,2
"The game uses a trophy based system for in game rewards. However, one's ability to collect trophies are inversely affected by one's level. Seems straight forward enough, but after almost 2 months of this, low level dungeons no lead the trophy boards, and receive the rewards. High level dungeons on the other hand are punished for success.",2
"Clever design. Great graphics, but the game has major issues and is modified far too often. Keep your wallet handy because you have to pay for the gems that fuel the gameplay or progress is very slow.",1
I loved this game until i took a look at clash of clans. Then i said to myself i no longer like the DK play style. I dont like the fact that i am forced to spawn my minions in a certain area unlike clash because they die quickly and thats it. So it was good why it lasted. Farewell DK may our paths cross once again someday. :'(  still loce the free wall paper lol,4
Great game. Fun as the classic computer game which I still play,5
Drains battery since patch,4
Funny,4
This is a really addicting game...if you play alot join LDS WARRIORS! we are a great clan that will help you get really good at the game...,5
AWESOME!!,5
Best game ever,5
Imps 2x efficiency does not cut time to complete tasks,2
Ruined by micro transactions :\,2
"DK2 was always my favorite pc game since I first played it many years ago. So of course when I saw that there was a DK game app I was very excited. For the most part they have stuck to the core of the game with the exception of a few things like gems, my main concern with this form of the game is that there is NO POSSESSION SPELL.  The ability to control any creature and survey your dungeon through 1st person was where alot of its charm came from. Id like to see this come back in some form again. Thanks!",4
Cant actually raid,1
I downloaded this app and every time I open it it starts to load and then says it cant connect to the server. I want to play this game so please fix this issue,1
The problem is it glitches & freezes. It goes to the main screen then it won't go any further. Then I have to uninstall it then reinstall it. In order to play it at all. The other is it takes to long to get gems. You should be able to. Exchange the rock for gems also. Instead of paying for them. Which I won't do.,1
It's great,5
"Love the game, but for some reason now, every time I try to log in it says unable to connect to server...error code 7. Please fix this and my rating will go back up",1
Takes about 3 min to load game then freezes over half of the time. Every time I try to go thru a raid it crashes.   Fix soon or I'm deleting it,2
"Its an amusing game until you ƒ£et far enough along and finally realize that you have no chance at competing with the few hundred people who dump endless amounts of cash into their dungeon.  Not long after that, you come to the conclusion that the game is more like a chore than something entertaining.",2
Want to play this game. Loved it on pc. But on both my phone and tablet it can't ever get to the game.,2
Dungeon Keeper was the first game I played on my first PC. I got hooked once now it hooked me again. Great game definitely one of my favorites. Small file size and few bugs.,5
Used to play the PC version if they would come out with another one I would be the first to buy!,5
"I always got disconnected during pvp and exclusive raids even though my internet is working normally, can't earn anything from that",1
"Very similar to the original PC game. Nice little tactics puzzles for you to figure out how to get past. At lower levels a trained monkey could do them, but the higher you get, the more difficult they become. Be stingy with your gems. They are slow coming back unless you buy them for real coin of the Realm :-D",4
excellent..... keep it up,5
Clash of clans is better,1
Would rather more rts like the original but good for what it is,5
"This game, packed with humor, gold, and a devil named ""Horny"", is just simply.. um... Beautiful.  Get. This. Game. Now. Do it. NOOW",5
"Great game. Awesome graphics. In app purchases not a big deal, nothing is free. Unfortunately loaded my game today only to see I lost ALL progress. Not a happy camper. Fix me please.",2
Fun game but unless you want to spend money on it the game leveling up progress is slow.,4
This just wants you to spend money. They don't care if you enjoy it or not,1
"Raids constantly lose connection and burn any chance at an event,  constant connection errors and disconnects. Haven't been able to connect for 2 days. Used to be fun minus the lengthy build times.",2
It's better than it looks. If you like clash of clans you should try this game.,5
Aside from the pay to play system it's a fun game. The problem is that every time you launch an attack it's a gamble whether or not it will crash before you finish fighting.,2
Great game,5
This game is fun. Some of the side actions are funny (slapping imps) the only thing is somethings take too long,4
"The freemium model completely ruins this game in every possible way.  Everything is about those retarded gems, and if you're not paying top dollar, you can't even really do anything.  Want to build a decent dungeon for free?  DON'T EVEN TRY. It will literally take years to do.",1
"Everything is behind a timer or paywall. The ""game"" is constantly reminding you to give EA money to progress or wait a week for the imps to finish. The raids are broken, and forces you to spend real money to get back to raiding. The makers of this game should feel nothing but shame for such a broken product.",1
Decent game for what it is,4
Won't load,1
This game is really good I just wish you could do a guild war like clash of clans and that if your not in the last interval of five your a spectator and every guild could participate,5
Interesting blend of tower defense and base building. Can see it's a pay to win game. Fun though.,4
I enjoy playing this game. My biggest complaint is that this game needs a world chat so I can recruit people for the clan I'm in.,4
Fun,5
"They have made this game much better, but they need to deal with hackers.",4
"1 star is still too high of a rating for this game. Anyone who remembers the original dungeon keeper will be sorely disappointed. EA has ruined this game and turned it into a knock off. You can't do anything without a lot of patience, or a lot of money. Again, if you're a fan of the original, stick with the original. This game is horrible.",1
Unknown issue with google play service. Can't play,1
"In app purchases are ridiculous. You could potentially spend more than the game would cost on PC. Gem earning is very slow.  When imps are in their 2x efficiency, their construction completion time doesn't seem to change.",2
Very addicting!!,5
Bad bad bad!!!,1
Should be enough said but I'll expound a bit. A small bit. They've ruined a fun game. Dont expect to be treated fair in any way. To Ea. Please hurry up and go out of business. Sad that probably wont happen.,1
The server is a lot better and the updates have improved the game to the best one I've played,3
Much better,5
Name my first dungeon start making 4 guys to attack get a call come back I have to name my dungeon again... go through get a text name dungeon turn screen off name dungeon a game with a timer system like this can't restart and lose 5 minutes of progresses I HOPE this is just a bug because this looked fun 1 star till I can actually play the game.. Samsung galaxy note 3,1
Great game!,5
Raids take so much of your resources that you can't get ahead without spending ridiculous amounts of money. Make post raid safety longer or reduce the percentage of resources that people can steal in raids. Otherwise the game is a bust.,2
"Yes, it is the typical free to play app model, where you can pay for speed. But that is about it. This is your classic dungeon keeper game, where you are the dungeon master, setting traps, building your lair. Tons of fun! Nice black humor about it all.",5
Finally a good sequel to a classic!,5
Entertaining and different,4
If the higher lvl stuff didn't take so long it would be 5 for sure,4
GGG,5
awesome,5
"Good modern incarnationof the old game dungeon keeper 2 can be straight up installed and played on windows 8 btw update: toning it down to 3  stars, long wait times,8 hrs timeout  gank, repeat, can't get any headway without dropping huge $",4
Takes a while but is still challenging,4
"Very fun to play, in fact quite   Quite awesome",5
"They offered a free imp with the purchase of first gem purchases. I wanted 4 imps because the next imp cost 800, and free imp would be a great start. I purchased the gem(500), bought the 800 gem imp and then hit summon on the 4th imp(free). My gems went down by 800 and both imps appeared purchased, but going to the map only one imp showed up and the gems came back.  I had to purchase the next imp at 1200. So I'm only imp short of my desired plan and support said the free imp was the 800  place.",1
I miss the old dungeon keeper!!!!!! From my childhood. Needs more blood.,3
Cool game,5
"Network code 17...android tablet,have not been able to play at all....still not 5/08 Toshiba tablet",1
Cool but time consuming,4
One of the best strategy mobile games available.,5
You are terrible and your IAP abuse is terrible. Stop ruining games.,1
"The game could be really great, but the pay to play price point is really steep and the heart of the game, raiding other Keeper's dungeons is plagued with disconnect issues.  Any small connection disruption during the 4 minute raid window turns into a failure.  All resources are lost, your win streak bonus is reset and your is dropped; even if victory was immanent.",1
"I loved the original DK games on pc, still play them occasionally too. Unfortunately this is nothing like the old games except for the names and characters used. Umps, once the key to your dungeon are now the most expensive and almost require you to purchace gems for them. Still it is an enjoyable strategic combat game.",4
Really addictive fun.,5
Awesome,5
"Enjoying it so far. The humor blends in nice with game play. Like all ""free to play"" games,  if you really want the edge, you will spend some real cash. Otherwise, very entertaining.",4
So much fun,5
"I was disappointed when I tried to play the game, says I need internet access. I have limited data. Uninstalled",1
Swag,5
Broke IAP system.,1
Hands down one of the best games I've ever downloaded!!!,5
Cool game ever,5
"Great game, A must have",5
"Only wish it were more of a ""play as much as i want"" game. Instead, i find myself waiting for resources, buildings to be built, etc.. All the while, fighting the temptation to buy gems to speed things up a bit. Of course, such is the way with most Facebook and mobile games these days. Other than that, this is a great app, great graphics, great PvP choices, and brings back memories of the original DK on PC. I would recommend giving it a go. Also, does a number on cell battery (LG G2).",5
Fun game,5
"Seems okay so far, fun mechanics and level up options, but gem cost for vale seems rather high",3
Reminds me of diablo and overlord in one,5
Something New,5
"Such a good game. horned devil makes it worth playing, he is so funny!",4
"Horrible game, crashes nearly every time I battle.  Newest update pairs you against ridiculously overpowered people, not fun.  Uninstalled, they ruined the game.",1
I thought it would be just like clash of clans and bore me once I was out of the noon zone but it didnt do that at all.,5
"The new update is ridiculous,  the cave ins are not effective no more. Please fix the cave ins.",2
Fast pace cool game,4
"Very fun,  intuitive,  and addictive.  Wonderfully evil.",5
Better then best,5
THE BEST THERE IS.........,5
Down to one star.  I'm at a dead end.  I can't make enough money to build things anymore.   And even if you win the fight you loss all the resources around your base.,1
Played for 3 minutes before it became glaringly obvious that it is yet another clash of Farmville clone.,1
Awesome game,5
Slaptastic,5
The game reminds me of dungeon keeper on the pc.  Construction times are relatively small. The game is great but skeletons seem to be rather useless as of now.,4
Great game,5
"One of the most fun apps I've played in years, yet it is slow moving.   Great if you have patience, otherwise you will spend money for faster progress.   A great blend of Tower Defense, and a lengthy campaign.   Highly recommended.",5
Improvements that could be done faster digging / take away the bomb blowing up walls/ be able to move your heart/ once you've already dug up a rock whether or not you have workers still be able to move it a round/ be able to designate where you would be able to spawn from in your base not just any dig site or be able to close down the dig sites or permanently get rid of that way we have more better challenge I'd like to see peoples personal designs been made way they want to be not handicapped by a bunch of starting points so to sum it up I like a challenge of individual creativity. So fix it pleases fix that I'll give 5 stars,3
Game closes about half the time I click on the guard post.,1
Pretty decent free 2 play game. Guild mechanics need to be polished. Are guild leader has been afk for over a month and we can't replace him. Can't kick leeches that were promoted to lieutenants. Hard to recruit more players with a leaderless guild and no option to replace afk leader. Don't want to leave because of effort to get all our perks.,3
"Finally one of my childhood favorites returns to the world! And on my phone no less! This game is well made, although like all other games of this era it is pay to win. But you could just wait. Excellent game! How I've missed it so.",5
Awesome game,5
"I like this game, but the time it takes to do anything is ridiculous. A day to dig out one hard gemstone tile is a bit over the top. And, the old ""possession"" spell is missing from this version???",3
It's different from the other defense and raid games out there and it's uniqueness and funny lines make it a game worth getting.,4
I love this game,5
Seems pretty good,5
Enjoy it need help with losing my place in the game when I lose connection.,3
I love the game and have been playing for a couple months now! Still fun. last update with tournaments was great.,4
This game relies too much on IAP ruining the game,1
Great elements upgrades are reasonable. It's odd smacking minions make them work harder but really funny.,5
Bugs and really requires spending real money to get anywhere in the game.,2
Good time waster to fill in whrre needed. Lots of fun. Never gets dull.,5
Awesome,5
I paid $49.99 for gems and they have YET to show up in my game!  Lame!  I have requested a refund...If I don't get it I will be contactinig my CC company tomorrow to initiate a charge back! Edit: EA fixed the issue and gave me a 10% credit for my inconvenience.,4
"The original game was MUCH better. Base defense is a joke and you're constantly getting attacked and losing resources. If you like losing then this is your game, if not I suggest you try clash of clans instead.",1
Lovin it,4
The last update fixed most everything that bugged me about the game.  This game is most of the reason I check my phone these days!,5
Pretty fun dungeon defense,5
The wait times for upgrades jump dramaticly as you progress further through the game but overall the game is still enjoyable,4
Badass game. ‚ë©/‚ë©,5
"I loved played this game and got really far but another dungeon, somehow, got started over mine. My dungeon would sometimes appear and sometimes the new one did. Eventually it got to a point where my actual dungeon didn't even show up. I gave up and quit. Otherwise it was easily a 5 star.",2
"My ghosts just flew past my original targeted area 5 blocks away, to a very dangerous area 10 blocks away where they were obliterated and destroyed my entire strategy. This has been a reoccurring issue for last few weeks and has made me consider getting rid of the game (saddening since I put so much into it to reach level 3 obsidian) hopefully resolved soon, but for now I'm lowering my rating",2
Its really fun. You will have to wait a while until building complete but its modeled like clash of clans with a lot of PvP and building,5
This game is amazing! I love it. Been playing for the last few days. But I am reaching a problem where I keep capping out with gold and stone faster than I can expand my warehouses. Then there is no point in raiding too much cause you miss out on alot of plunder. I wanted to suggest a guild bank where we can store and save up for guild related stuff.,4
This game is awesome,5
Bow to keeper,5
Love it.  The only dislike I have would be the time it takes to upgrade rooms.,4
Just got a new updated phone and it looks cooler but keeps crashing now. I haven't played this game in over a decade. Fun game and glad it's on Android now and not just PC,5
Boo,1
Its funny,5
Muaha! Fun! &gt;:)),5
"I played the pc versions way back when. And for them to keep the hilarity and merge with todays platforms is amazing. The updates are refreshing and I play on multiple os versions with 0 problems. But just remember keep your friends close, and your knives sharp",5
"In the low levels its fun when u can win a raid, jump up in leagues and your killed because u dont pay for gems, kinda kills the fun, the game deserves more stars but the greed prevents that",1
Funfunfun,5
Loved the old one this is little different but still fun,5
"Great game, very addicting",5
It passes the time,4
"Would be a lot more fun without needless timers and the ""give us your money to progress"" attitude.",2
"Had this game for my computer. Loved it then, Love it now",5
"Im not into the ""Devil"".... but if it wasnt part of the devil I would be so much happier..... but good game still",4
Pay to play,1
Is a lot of fun right now,4
Amazing game,5
Lol,5
Fun,5
Good game,4
Its a great game but only problem i have is that when u attack you have to re buy troops which sux plz change that,4
Good game,5
"Not as good as the original DK2 but still fun,",4
"For months I enjoyed playing this game, untill one day I woke up and my dungeon was reset to the beginning.  Several times, i spent real money on this game purchasing gems and probably a few hundred hours playing it. For everything to be wiped out is such a shock.",1
Love how you can build your dungeon and raid other peoples dungeon,5
Just like I remembered. Thanks E A,5
It's cool,4
"Every time I load the game it always downloads a update which I already done multiple times, I'm not going to waste 44 mb of my own Internet every single time just for a bug that only needs fixing",3
"Fun enough, but downloads a 40+ meg nothing file every 24 hours. That's over a gig a month, what's your data plan like?",1
I just got a galaxy tab 10.1 (2014 edition) and this game is just perfect for it! Do recommend.,5
Please fix loading bugs immediately.,3
Love this app version of an old PC favorite!,5
Really fun,5
Great new version of a great game.,5
Absolute Awesomeness Five Stars,5
So far I like it.  Seems fun,4
I can wait,5
I was ready to play an awesome game. But no: Couldn't connect to network. Retry. Couldn't connect to network. Ect. I'm now ticked off. If this gets fixed I'll be happy. Please fix this.,1
Yea.. gems. That's what gets your thru faster and you have to pay to get Em quicker. Oh well. Still a fun game.,5
Make it almost like clash of clans please,4
It's not bad the pay to play a kind of stuff is getting old though but you're not the first step to do it it won't be the last,3
There are wayyyy too many aspects of the game that are pay to win,4
I am stuck on the uodate menu for a week now and I about to ask for my money back that I put into this game.  Do not download waste of your time.,1
But when I purchased gems i didnt get them:( please fix,5
Ruins an awesome game!,3
This game (in my opinion) is better than clash of clans,5
It's so cool,5
Fun to play.,5
"This is an excellent game, and good as far as mechanics go. But i just now lost over a hundred gems to the game freezing and restarting in the middle of a survival raid. Fix, and id really like my gems back.",4
Good kickstart to a classic pc game.,4
", great game. Definitely worth the download.",5
Great game its better than Clash of Clans. But its to much space and got boring.,4
"Purchases are required if the game is to be anything but a drawn out slog of mining, development,  more accumulation, more mining, and still more mining.  Plus, very slow to load since the recent update.",2
While the game can be glitchy at times and the ai can use a little improvement it is really good overall,4
In app $ ruin the game,1
"Absolutely HORRIBLE connection issues.  And why does it that every time I open it it takes about 1-2 MIN. to ""Update"" something.  Make a update ASAP to FIX that.",1
Seems to be a great game to waste some time on.,5
Love watching my lair grow. Just wish it was a little more like the PC game but awesome for my MotoX,4
"The new matchmaking system bottlenecks lower level players into unwinnable fights. Game was my fave before this update, now I am considering removal.",1
,5
"Since the new update,I'm constantly thrown out of battle and the game reboots ,therefore causing me to lose the battle because I can never complete it .......please fix",4
Expensive,3
"Take an old game, re-purpose so the object rewards in-game purchases over stratagy.  Throw in the fact that the application/game is network intensive (meaning the game will crash mid-stroke, if it can't communicate with the mothership) and that is what dungeon keeper has to offer.   If it looks good at first glance; my recommendation is uninstall and avoid).",1
Im getting better and like clash of clans,5
Latest update seems to have squashed the bugs. Not the same as the classic but a good take on it with many of the same elements.,5
I still can't seem to stay connected. I keep getting disconnected mid raid. Losing resources and minions.,1
Its like a game I've played on xbox where u defend and attack dungeons!!!,5
Great game 15 years ago for the PC.   Great game now for your phone.  I wish there were more witty comments from horny though.  If there were more snide remarks it would absolutely be a five star game.,4
"Although frequent server disconnects occurred, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It kept boring days a bit more productive. Still could use better servers... but that's the only reason it lost a star.",4
"Awesome game, great graphics and sound.  Excellent game play.",5
"Not only is it an unimaginative and linear recreation of the original game, it is shamelessly a pay-to-win extreme. It starts out kind of fun, but you soon realize that you can't do *anything* without waiting hours or even days unless you pay up. The narrator even openly mocks you, making fun of in-app purchases, then dares you to pay anyway. They try to suck you dry before you are even committed to the game, which can't even be an effective moneymaker.  Besides crossing the line in demanding for money, the dungeons are too small and boring. Tournaments are fun, but monsters are limited and anyone can win by spending the most money. Not worth my time or wallet.",1
Of coarse it wants you to spend money but its a good game,5
Well done,5
You better love it!!!!,5
interesting take on the old school game but still prefer the old school game,3
"At dungeon heart 5 and treasury and warehouse at level 7 it keeps stating I need dungeon heart at 6  to upgrade them both further, problem is the warehouse only stores 381k or so and I need 400k to upgrade the heart to 6....yea UPDATE: It apparently fixed itself so I give it a 3 so far, got to see more of the game first.",3
I have more fun playing the old Dungeon Keeper games on the PC. There's more freedom to create your dungeon then on this mobile version.,3
Addicted,5
"A lot of the hate for this game is misdirected, and is meant more for freemium games as a whole or EA as a publisher.   The game itself isn't any different from Clash or a Zynga game. You do stuff, wait for things to recharge, do more of the same. They have events to keep things interesting, and you can turn notifications off, which is a new thing EA is trying that I really like. Connections do drop. especially during raids (which sucks) but it even happens during dungeon building (ie dungeon keeping)",4
Buggy! Battles are not fair! You're pitted against dungeons that are too far above your level. Don't bother!,1
Cool! Only bad thing is needs easier way to get minions and gems. Please :-),5
"Fun, the demons name is hilarious",5
"I wish you could just buy the game and not have to deal with having to buy jems if you want more imps and stuff. Othere than that I'd have given it 5 stars. I loved the original game, i still have the original dungeon keeper 2 box on my shelf cause the artwork was so cool.",4
Epic,5
Really worth the download,5
"Didn't have it downloaded long enough to do anything with the game at all and it shut down, but not just that, it actually messed my phone up. I restarted and am uninstalling. So... id call that a fail......yup....",1
Just as good as I remember,5
"Please please add support for my ""Galaxy Note 3"" stylus!!  Please lower cost of Imps, or raise quantity of gems for money... the last imp is essentially $40. This is a bit much don't you think? I could buy a block buster game a few months after release for that much. Will give 5 star if both things happen, 1 star per complaint.",3
Please wait while your imps get your dugeon in order!  I liked this game but the last update has made it unplayable. Please fix it!,4
Great game,5
"Overall, a decent social game, but with a critical flaw: the game drops WAY too often. Especially in the survival raids, it consistently disconnects after several waves, right before the big gem rewards begin. Really makes me wonder...",3
"Fun again, you can actually play without dumping a ton of money",5
Just wish some of the upgrades didn't take days to build.,4
"The game is developed by very inexperienced interns who are in way over their heads, and suffers from severe issues regarding performance, network connectivity/stability, very flawed game design/imbalances, and a Pay-To-Win philosophy.  If you know and like Dungeon Keeper, I recommend checking it out for the style & voice-overs. It can be enjoyable for a short while, but ultimately the flaws become very clear as you progress, and anybody can defeat you if they are simply willing to spend a little money to do so.  I highly recommend not wasting any money on it. Each update keeps making it worse and EA has no intention of giving it the proper respect it deserves.  If you simply want a good game of this type, there are far better choices by competent developers.",1
"Leveled up to 23 and can't seem to beat anybody anymore without paying. Maybe it's just me, I dunno.",3
"A complete exploitative abomination.  Everyone involved in the creation of this ""game"" should kill themselves out of disgrace.",1
This game has potential but once you start to get closer to a million of any resource amazingly you can count on that moment to be attacked and lose 250k of your resources.  Never fails.  That means to get the better stuff you have to spend real money.  Freemium games always have some devious thing but you can still say no thanks and very there eventually but there is no way to get by this.  Dumb!,3
I like it though it's nothing compared to the original,5
It's fun just like it describes.,5
Took a while to figure it out but it's a lot of fun,5
this game is awesome.. after the newest update this game is insanely graphic and new raids are fantastic.,5
"I'm already hooked on this game. Like clash of clans but with a few nice twists and a much darker/funnier tone. Just keep the optimization updates coming guys, the game chugs pretty hard at times (on an HTC one) compared to its more polished peers",5
Love it,5
"The game itself is good, well thought out. Very good game play.",4
Great and fun game but unfortunately pay2win,5
Love it its as fun as clash of clans,5
Such fun to raid people,5
Good time killer,3
Its a good game I like it its fun,5

Waste of time,1
"Dungeon Keeper was my favorite game of all time when it came out for PC. This adaptation is equally addicting and fun to play. Achievements are challenging and progressive and if you're responsible with gems, you'll never need to spend actual money to play.",5
interesting game concept and fun to play,5
Tournament-we had 132 tournament stars. They are GONE,1
I re I remember the original game have that was pretty fun too this game is fun because of the multiplayer aspect its fun to build dungeons its fun to slap the minion around and overall good time  so 4 stars,4
It's a fun game. Kind like clash of clans just more strategic,5
I LOVE this game . Very well put together. Never get bored and frequently updated with new stuff,5
It is easy to understand and I think everyone should like slapping imps!!! The graphics are well done and very cute!,5
Every click results in a loading screen. After the load whatever I did is forgotten. Build something. Loading. Build it again. Probably 5 times before it agrees.,1
Awesomely dark and calculating.... come join an active guild that is like family.,5
Need to fix the connection issues,2
Great game,5
Good fun,5
"New update and it won't even let me play /: it logs in, then goes back to my home screen on my phone",1
I loved this game,5
It's fun. It takes a lot of patients. The game begging for money every few minutes gets tiresome after a while. If you can get past that it is fun. Constant updates keep adding more features to the game.,4
ITD go,5
Love this game an all but something needs to be done about the crashing... it'll crash when I'm raiding someone and counts negative on my part etc etc this is total bullshit... have  zte solar,2
"It is fun to build stuff and to get the excitement for creating the next best thing, but when you want to do more than get that excitement good luck with holding on to your real world money. Besides that.... OMG please change what happens when I get disconnected in the middle of a raid! Its like I am throwing away all my progress when I get disconnected.",3
"So far so good on my galaxy note 3.  Micro transactions will get you, just be patient.",5
A little buggy . Unfortunatly there is not a task confirmation button. Sometimes you'll set your minions to unnecessary tasks .,3
Makes me want to play the original,4
Not so much a game as a frustration simulator.,1
"This is less a review of the game, which is such a blatant moneygrab, that it defies need for review. This is a comment on the fact that my information was fraudulently used to claim I had given it 5 stars. I was just informed by a friend that I was listed as having given the game this, despite never having reviewed a game/app on the app store at anytime in the past.  Gotta love a game programmed to make itself seem better than it already is.",1
This is a game of patience. You have to wait days to upgrade your room or you can always give EA as all your $$$$,1
Get rid of in app purchases. Play for 2 minutes and you are done for a week.,1
Game itself is fun and promising at first appearance. Issues with gameplay mechanics play style that the tutorial teaches newcomers to the game will ultimately punish them later on with the multiplayer aspect. Until they fix the issue with mines where having fewer is better this game will be uninstalled.,2
"Gives me that nostalgic feeling from years ago with the original, I was so excited to see this, and yet its so different, it'll take getting used to. I wish they would come out with the original again",4
Lots of fun,5
Keeps me coming back :),3
First thing I did was to install dungeon keeper. When I did I was shocked to find my dungeon set way way back and I only have two imps. I paid for and had 4. A lot of my buildings are there but are not upgraded where they had been. How can I at least get what I paid for back. It would take forever to do anything with two imps when I'm still ahead so far. What can I do. In game name da dungeon. I don't want to put all that time back in just to get where I was. Just digging out to all the mines would take for,4
"This game is a close second to the greatness of Dungeon keeper. In their last update EA and Mythic made their pay-to-play game much better. Now free players can earn gems faster armias can be respawned, there are immortals that cost gold and not gems and the gameplay is actually fun. Only downside to this game is waiting. I have a 6 day room being upgraded and it can't defend itself until finished. My last review is revoked. Great game EA and Mythic.  Thanks for tidying up the gameplay system.",4
Fun to play. More than just another mindless game.,5
"This game has a lot of good things. It's connectivity is not one of them. ""Hey, let's go attack... play for 10s... dreaded loading screen, kicks you out of the attack and auto-lose."" Come on EA, if you reconnect and the match is still going, shouldn't you be able to rejoin? This is terrible.",1
So much fun,5
"Even with 4g i can not connect to the game, good game but horrible connection",2
Got Better,5
Unfortunately the latest update doesnt load on my samsung mega. This is the game I play the most. Please fix this and you get 5+ stars.,3
it crashed it always!!! Sucks that u have to buy gems to do some progress!!!,1
Loved the game until they screwed up the ranking system. Haven't seen a single opponent at my level. Not fun to play when you're always outgunned.,1
Super fun,5
Games,4
I was initially excited to see one of my favorite old games on the play store and then i downloaded it. Hope you enjoy hours upon hours of waiting between each step in your gameplay. Otherwise just avoid this game.,1
"Miss the series, not a fan of these mmo, farmville style task oriented games	Original dungeon keeper and dungeon keeper 2 were far better. Unfortunately they don't work worth s*** on a new computer so i'll take what I can get.",4
"Time consuming, very fun, almost comparable to the original PC game...only thing unfavorable is the time it takes imps to work, not a fan!!!! Otherwise, well done!",4
This game looks fun could you make it compatible with android?,1
Fun gameplay. I love cave builders and there aren't many out there,5
Great Game,4
"Fun. But It will take time to build a decent keep,",4
The newest update is the worst thing the game makers could have done. Now the game matches you with players that are extremely overpowered.,1
"More resource,  more gems, more fun, and more interaction in the guild. I love the newest updated.",5
"The game is fun, looks and works pretty good (aside from the  long loading time). I wouldn't mind the long building/upgrading periods if they were done right, but the whole thing is very inconsistent. You go from waiting 1 day to waiting 5 days to upgrade a building, the same goes for spells, it takes 98 points to upgrade a spell to level 2 and more than 600 points to upgrade the same spell to level 3. The guild accomplishments are pretty pointless, they take too much effort to complete and the perks really have no impact on the game, whatever they add is pretty insignificant.  All in all I like the game, but i have to say the in app purchases are always horrible, which isn't a problem exclusive to this game, it seems to be the standard for mobile games in general.",4
Love the classic feeling nice remake,5
"The game is laggy and I have had several issues with losing gems during disconnects on raids. Made no since to me and they said it was from in game purchases which I didn't make. They try to force you to buy gems from them. Their only solutions was no solution. Which is not acceptable in a game I vested over a month of time into. When I wasn't satisfied with response, I opened a new ticket in which the same customer service rep got attached and he told me to stop wasting their time they aren't going to fix",1
Often lose connection during raids.  Otherwise a good game.,2
"Lots of fun and I love the game I just wish these great games didn't force you to pay money but I do understand the reason as well , good job",5
Add more space to the dungeon so people can build more.,5
Good game,5
Love this game. It is so much like the original PC game from years past.,5
"Great classic game, lots of fun.",5
Addicted,5
"Its good game,",4
Usually I don't like games like this because you hit a wall (which I did) However the new update made it a lot easier to save up for upgrades. However now that trolls attack the closest room. The chance of winning a raid is pretty much 98% which is just a load of crap.,3
Fun!,5
,5
"I thought the point was to design a dungeon which combines room layout and traps to keep invaders from your dungeon heart.  But with the plethora of tools they give that lets you simply drill through anywhere you want, its a monotonous game of raid, win, get raided, lose.",1
Fun waste of time.,5
"I'm a tech writer, and I installed this app solely to grab a few screenshots. Do not download this trash. EA wants your money, simply put. There is nothing redeeming about this scam. Please, go to GOG and download the original game for a few dollars, where you'll never be asked to buy gems or any other crap like this.  These types of games have to stop, and as long as you're spending money they won't.",1
I love how its so easy to get trophies I like this game so much             WWWWWWOOOOOOOOWWWWW,4
I enjoy,5
I like this game because its cool.,5
Love the originals and this revamp retains what made them good.,5
I really like it because it's like this one game i played but i forgot what's it's called but this one is better,5
Love it!! The only thing missing is global chat. How am I supposed to recruit people for my guild if I cannot talk to people that play the game? Other than that good job and keep the updates coming!,5
but gems are waaaay to expensive. $10 buys you imp #4 and thats it. Save all your gems and you can get imp #3 for free after you play for a bit. UPDATE: Nee tourneys are good. Update is pretty legit,4
Good game,4
Enjoyable to the max,5
This is an excellent game i recommend everyone play it,5
Real good,4
Great game... Until you get to the in app purchases. They are ridiculous. I'd rather pay $5 for the full game with close to no waiting as opposed to having to spend crazy amounts of money to make an upgrade not last days..,3
"After everything is said and done, Dungeon Keeper is my favorite of the 'tap and wait' game genre. The only reason this application doesn't completely blow me away is the constant disconnecting and reconnecting. Its almost 1 minute of reconnecting for every 5 minutes of gameplay.  Also take note that this does indeed interrupt whatever you may be doing at the time, be it raiding or doing campaign missions. Not only is it a major inconvenience, but it also takes quite a toll on your battery. Be warned.",4
Fun game but it get frustrating that you are constantly barraged by players who are levels above you. You basically don't stand a chance against them. They need a better match making system.,3
"I am enjoying this game.  It is typical of a defender style game.  Takes a set amount of time to accumulate resources and develop each part of your dungeon.  There is a heavy emphasis on pvp and raiding other players.  However,  I find the notifications to be a bit too many.  Instead of one notification to alert you to check the game, you get 4 or 5 different notifications for each thing going on.  Also, I have been matched up with dungeons to raid and been raided by players way above my power level.",4
Loved the original computer game! This is a fun mobile version.,5
Don't get this game.,1
Takes time but very fun game.,5
"It never show the keyboard when asked to give a name to my dungeon. LoL EA, another fail for the worst company in the world.",1
Good  I am a beautiful person,5
You play D&D never think of the effort that goes into the setup of a great dungeon.  Well this is your chance to see it for yourself.,4
Like it a lot,4
Things take time its like building a car and seeing whatbu can do. Well let's see what our imps can do haha. I love game buy or don't its a game who said u have to buy to get up their in a game? I don't I love seeing time build my dungeon. ;),5
A long time coming since DK2 which I loved and I'm in hell (heaven) over the new release. YAY!!!!,5
Game is a time waster,5
A mobile version of the old PC game would have been amazing. Instead all this is is a poorly made clash of clans redux.,1
"A few things that kept me from loving this game (aside from unrealistic wait times for upgrades and the shamefully expensive alternatives to waiting) were issues with usability and performance. With the latest update, those issues have been satisfactorily addressed: game loads ~10-15% faster, gameplay is smoother, less wait time when raiding, and now I can actually see my minions I have without having to begin a raid!  Now maybe they can work on their payment model?",4
"But perfect for a mobile version!  At first I was put off by having to wait for everything to be done, even the digging. But after putting some time into it, this new version of the franchise really starts to shine!  You can start of following the basics of the tutorial layout of the dungeon but after the first day you will be attacked, and you will lose...  It is from there that you will start to learn the tricks and techniques behind dungeon layout and setting traps for any would be invaders.",5
"It's such a shame.  If EA had just charged money up front to buy the game, I would probably give it 4-5 stars.  Instead, the microtransactions ruin what could have been a cool game.  If you don't pay, be prepared to wait longer and longer for each dungeon upgrade until you're waiting multiple days for each thing.  Playing 5 minutes at a time with hours or days in between does not make for a fun game.",3
The newest update is great. Easier to get gems from playing. I've made about 100 gems in a three day period.,3
"Was a good befire tge update now it keeps crashing .....I hsve a samsung mega, graphics are goid and the he game play was excellent..but overall great game before update",3
"A constant click to upgrade game that eventually leaves you waiting several days to do anything.  Pay to eliminate time, but what for? To wait to upgrade your next room? Interest seems to be to suck your money before you get too bored than to entertain and keep us playing.",2
Fun!!,5
"Love it, just I wish that the dk premium/ deals weren't so irrisitable",4
Obviously a good game and no reason not to download,5
Unrealistic build times. Literally only open the game once a day. Maybe in a year I'll have a decent dungeon.,2
"Things take time to upgrade, but the raids are so much fun!",5
Their intro a bit tedious but it quickly develops to a strategic game,5
"Ruin the huge potential any game like this.  It's fun to build up your dungeon and raid other ones, but the entire purpose of this game is to generate revenue for EA.  You must buy gems if you don't want to wait hours or even days in order to make progress.",1
"Fun, but a bit slow paced. Great graphics and sound.",4
Okay had to lower my score... still USUALLY enjoy the game but the amount of disconnects is infuriating. Practically can't raid or even talk in guild chat anymore because of them. What's with that?,2
Would be great if it wasn't so tight with gems.,3
"I absolutely love Dungeon Keeper, I'm a huge fan of the original PC version. Thank you for bringing back an epic classic!",5
Amazing game one of my favorite games to play must have game for anyone,5
Epic,5
Wish it was more open like the PC version.,4
"Disconnects before I can even start the game EVERY TIME. I haven't been able to log in for almost a month. C'mon EA, why does your game run like a pile of feces when every other app has no problem?",1
Standard time killer base building game. It's best feature is the nostalgia if you played Dungeon Keeper for PC.,3
This game cured my scoliosis,3
"Not nearly enough fun for the time required.  Expansion feels extremely limited as does the process of building minion armies.  Too bad, really liked the original game and this had so much potential. Even after the update, the freemium model just does not work well for this game.",2
Now that I have a different  Internet service and generally no access where I live to cell signal....can't connect at all. I have this problem with no other mobile app. Game itself is great except for the extreme wait times which of course can be remedied if you're willing to spend a heck of a lot money for a small mobile game. Update when they released a small update a couple of weeks back I could connect some of the time. Now with the newest update can't connect at all again.,1
"Not an enjoyable experience. Takes to long for everything to happen, no matter what you do to build up the dungeons defenses there is always a way to surcumvent them. Unless you can pay to speed things up and building everything to the max then expect to lose every single time",1
"Update 3 addressed almost everything that needed improvement Fun, addictive, and pure evil!",5
Cool iiit,5
"***update to my review*** needs a better guild chat feature. Too many steps to communicate with fellow guild members****  Combines the addictive qualities of a city building game like clash of clans with a turret defense game. Super legit, and fun to pick up when you have a little bit of time.",5
"Its a slower paced game later on, at least for upgrades, you can keep battling about every 30 min,  Join my new guild, Immortal Heart USA...",5
Fun game,5
Fun fun,4
"I used to play the computer game when I was younger, and this game is just awesome and hilarious, definitely got to check it out.",5
It lags whenever you have too many monsters on the battlefield and it crashes right after and whatever you press died in combat and after the crash you paid for them but you didn't get a good result same thing goes with Jim's if it crashes same thing goes what's golden rock only if you have took a little bit from your opponent you may have that maybe,3
Omg. Best game ever.,5
Disappointment,1
Yes yes yes,5
This game is awesome!,5
"It was fun at first.  I would have rather paid for a fully functional game that could of given me hours of fun.   Now that I've gotten higher in level the game is starting to drag on and the freemium model is starting to really annoy me.  The time lag between being able to do anything is becoming obnoxious.  Furthermore, when my touch screen flaked out it spent a bunch of 'gems' even tho I didn't want to.  There is no confirmation screen, just a brief timeout (which isn't useful if your touch screen is acting up).  By the time I got the screen off and back on to clear the weirdness, it spend a good chunk of the 'gems' which I would never EVER pay for.  I would of spent $5 (maybe $10, but definitely $5) on a fully working game.  I will NOT waste money for a stupid resource.  I pity those who think that's an intelligent purchase.   tl;dr Was fun at first, nostalgic to the original but it looses its fun as you wait and wait later on. Just lost another 200 gems I know not how. Goodbye another star",2
Love the direction of the new update.,5
This is a good reimagining of clash of clans gameplay in the DK theme not just a carbon copy clone. 5 star game ruined by poor flow at the start. The 3rd imp should come before you have to start digging 4+ hour walls.,4
Had some issues for a bit but it's working again...,5
Love it can't stop playing,5
"Great! In many aspects, and terrible in so many other. The gameplay is rich and fluid. The graphics and commentary are nice and refreshing. However, the amount of time it takes to construct something or upgrade it pushes you closer and closer to spending real money. The prices are highly unreasonable. If the pay to win factor wasn't strong enough, the disconnecting issues will put you to the brink of quitting. It's a great game, but it is very flawed. EDIT: GETTING BETTER THERE EA! KEEP IT UP!",3
"Micro transactions are not micro enough. Also, as many crystals as things cost, I wish they were easier to earn. I'm actually much more likely to spend money on currency I can earn relatively easily (and get used to the stuff you buy with it, and start relying on it) than games where earning it is rare (I just simply never spend it in those)",3
Best game,5
Hellz yeah on the new update.!!!! Please add reply on testing your friends dungeon so I can rub it in Muhahahaha,5
"The new content in the update is great and all, but cant do much with it because the game disconnects every minute or so. Impossible to raid with this going on",3
In app purchases destroy the game.  Every little action takes obsurd amounts of time unless you throw money at it. Greedy EA broke yet another possibly great game due to its lust for cash.,3
This app can be fun but after a point things take way way way too long.,3
But EA. I loved this game. Until the money part happened.,2
This app causes you to use real money for everything.   And if you don't have money to spend.  Don't get it.   I spent 400 dollars so far to date.  This is an exspensive game. or for people who have real patience,5
Still a money grab.,3
"The game is great. It's a money grabber just like every other big game so don't see why people complain there. The only reason I give it four stars is it constantly drops connection in the middle of fights, causing you to lose them. You have to reload the game if you lose connection for a second",4
"Cool update, but had a hard time deciding if it was worth app booting at startup",3
"The game needs to be more clear when you are paying gems, or when you will be getting them. Since its under the same quest section, I thought I was getting 10 gems or more each, but no it was deducting them. Given I was mining for those gems, I am highly disappointed I can't get them back",5
That is what the game runs off of,2
"Fun game, little frustrating",3
"Like the game,  but guilds unavailable for extended periods during and after updates.",3
"Absolutely destroys my battery life.  I would understand this if I spent a lot of time playing, but I don't. This is strange because by its nature I'm simply not spending THAT much time actually playing the game, most of the time I shut it down for about an hour or two to wait for building times to complete. Where is the absurd power use coming from here?",2
"Been playing this game for a few weeks now, and while it can be frustrating at first, it has really become a lot of fun over the past couple of weeks.",4
Warning game is extremely addicting and fun. You will recommend it to your friends. Best defense game I've every played on my phone,5
"If you play for free, everything takes too long, and there's a frustrating need to log in regularly to keep things on track, so you can't really treat it as a once a day log in. Never played the other versions, so I find this enjoyable, but drags. Although, now that I am at a higher level, it flows better...",3
BCEM COCATb  is a cheater EA common. 10:25 am Wednesday April 23rd. Check out that replay. You've got to address this issue!!!!,4
"It is quite buggy, but it is new and being actively improved. It is still early in its development, so if you are like me and enjoy being one of the first players, join now.",4
"So far, this game holds true to its predecessor. I love it!!!",5
Fun game,5
Meh...nobody wants to pay real money to play this type of game. Other than that it's fun,3
Game is a load of crap because of continuously dropping players midgame. Never mind all the stuff about macro transactions. The premium currency is a waste of money if they just kick you off during raids. Sort out your servers EA!,1
This game is fun,5
Awesome game,5
"Wait times for upgrading things are pretty ridiculous, making you want to spend money on gems because of the wait, but other than that this game is really well made and I love it.",5
"They trick player on the rating. Filled with too much micro transactions. Slow game play. Basicly, pay to play",2
Great game. Fan of series but only fail is I bought gems and have never received them. Please fix.,1
This game is so fun to place and for just a few dollars you can get a head start on your imp collection,5
I like it so far. But I'm just in the first hour of play. Will re-rate later,3
Imagine best game you've ever played with all the game play ripped out and replaced with coin slots.  Imagine if you removed control and strategy from Madden and replaced it with a GO button.   Imagine Darth Vader with Gilbert Gottfried's voice.,1
Love the humor and that is what keeps me coming back.  If I can stay connected long enough the game itself is fun too.  The constant disconnections even when I'm using high quality wifi on my android device is extremely aggravating.  If it would let me keep playing when it disconnects I'd give it 5 stars.,2
In game purchases are expensive,2
I have to sneak in playing time whenever I can! This game is just too addicting!,5
A great game with a new twist on the strategy game,5
Cool tities,5
If you like dark magic and monsters then you will love this Best game to 4 horns and a soul,5
Very fun! Sure its an in app purchase game but I only spent $5 and found that to be sufficient. Lends well to dipping in for some quick play a few times a day for busy gamers. If you are impatient and dont want to spend money then this game isnt for you.,5
Been playing this game for quite some time and still enjoy logging in every day. :),5
Ya baby,5
All right,4
"I want it for my PC, like in the old days.",1
Could be fun if you weren't disconnected constantly.  Real-time attacks fail and everything is lost when you are inevitably disconnected.  Cannot collect resources because of disconnects....  about every 10 seconds now.,2
"Making guild chat a little more centralized, would be awesome. I don't like the fact that I need to click on the guild menu, then over to the chat tab, to see the latest convo. Seeing it on the home screen, would be way better. And its probably a lot to ask, but spice it up a little! Events shouldn't just be survival! There should possibly be GvsG battles! But all in all, good game. Keep up the good work, guys.",5
Fun time wasting game,4
Gems are too hard to gather. It's either pay for them or wait weeks to gather enough to be useful.,4
"This game is constantly crashing during special mission, I could not tell you how many gems I've lost due to it would be a great game if bit for that! Refund on gems please!",3
"I loved this game on pc so I had try it on hear. The game is really close to the original. I'm having a lot of fun. The only thing i don't like is being attack by much higher level dungeon keepers,which the same thing happens on other games of this sort.",4
So much fun,5
"It started out fun for the three minutes I was able to play when it finally finished downloading updates. Then it asked me to name my dungeon but it won't let the keyboard pop up and I can't get past that screen with out typing something. Once again excellent jop on quality control EA. I would like to think EA would have made more money if they had left the game as it originally was and sold it for a decent price, instead of trying to milk people to buy gems to speed up absurdly long build times.",1
"Nearly impossible to play without spending hundreds of dollars, the microtransactions make this game atrocious",1
Best game on the play store. So much to do and you never get get bored. Great job ea team.,5
Nice Job,5
First game I played where others can steal your progress. Unless you buy in game boosts you will start losing resourses. People will sack and take more of your resourses than you earn in a day even with Max level mines.  I started with 1100000 gold ended the entire day with 900000. You never have enough anti flyer traps to defend everywhere and wallbursting spell will always get you since you don't have enuf resources to upgrade all weakspots. This is a game for dungeon robbers not builders.,2
Nice nostalgia trip back to my earlier PC gaming days. Good graphics and sound.,5
Glitches much too often. Very slow.,2
"Great idea, flawed by F2P",1
The game is well made. It's still got a little bit more to go but so far well done.,5
"Really fun and lots to do, keeps me entertained!",5
Kind of a rip off. Just a cash grab with a game built around it.,3
"The game is okay, but has the common ""pay to play"" trick of either waiting hours for something basic, like building a room, or pay to have it done immediately. The game requires internet, even if merely doing the campaign... Which seems counterintuitive considering that many folks use their phones to game when they are stuck somewhere with no signal and no one to talk to.",3
It cool,4
"Hmmmm cannot ""connect to server"" today. So 2**s. Till that changes.",2
It keeps saying couldn't connect to server,1
I like the changes from the real game...  but getting annoyed with not being able to log in to my dungeon!,4
What the f is going on???  Warn us of this!!!,1
Everything you try to do after the first five hours of gameplay you are stopped by days upon days of waiting. It only gets worse the more you play.,1
Large updates and failure to connect at times. Subtract stars for this reason.,3
"In app purchase isn't as bad as I initially thought, while this game is really slow to start it picks up once your dungeon heart is lvl 7 plus you get free gems from events and from digging. Better than clash of clans imo",5
"Nice game.....or it would be. EA keeps ""updating "" the game to keep it ""fresh"" which would be great if it didn't end up costing the players all the time it takes to upgraden or real money they spend to advance the game. I keep upgrading buildings and spells, and get new abilities, then a new update comes along and the everything I was able to do is taken and I need to again lvl up to unlock them.....again. Update: more complaints. Trying to connect or keep connected is the true game in this ""game""",2
Fun to play though I miss the original on pc. But this is an excellent substitute.,5
Good game :-),5
This is a cool game play it anyone its fun,5
COOL,5
Very fun,5
Baby local roots even notice but I just yeah I can,5
"I've only played this for a day and I already love it more than Clash of Clans. Really love the voice acting, very funny. Keep up the good work guys!",5
Great app,5
"Plz join the alliance called ""United Inabed Society"" if you want to be in an awsome, forgiving, constantly donating, good, and charitable guild.",2
"I have enjoyed this game for the most part, it's a fun little free game that does the free game formula well.",5
"Not as good as the old, but its alright",4
Like any game it could be better here and there but over all i like it!,3
It was great until they made the graphics not so clear.change graphics to how they were and I will give five star,4
This game is constantly trying to reconnect now. When it happens it also kicks you out of your match.,4
Easy to learn and too addicting to put down!,5
Keep the updates coming!!!!,1
It's an ok game it passes the time at work.,3
If it would let you download a then 5 star,1
"As a player of the desktop dungeon keeper, I felt at first it lacked the ability to defensively redeploy minions with my fists ... But, with careful crafting, a dungeon can cause attackers to go where you want them. Sure, you can blast the walls, but you then have no mana to deal with the rest of what I have devised, sucker! If you are new, play carefully and you can have three imps on day one with no added cost. (Which EA will happily take). The guild flag skeleton for attacking actually feels like the older desktop style, so I give it a four star rating. Not revolutionary in its ""thin 3d"" interface, but good enough to earn the name Dungeon Keeper. You won't catch my imps slacking. (edit) Oh, and eventually you do get immortals you can control ... and capture from enemy keepers. So, grudgingy here is a 5 star rating for an app I was initially unimpressed with. Leaving only one annoying wart to the game, the inabilty to vote out ann awol guild leader.",5
Nice to see this game again... played the original back in the 90's.,4
Cool game and having lots of  fun,5
Great game,5
,3
"Constant disconnection, don't receive purchased goods.  Takes a long time to load and reconnect and reconnect and reconnect and reconnect.................",1
"I play the game, capture dungeon heart, mine stone then supposed tp purchase imp. Nothing can be done except end the app.  Waste of my time",1
Need to fix glitches,2
Every time I use my moto g the game crashes. It works on my Asus tf701t. Other than that I love the game. Fix the crashing for 5 stars again.,3
"this game isn't bad, it's just plain wrong. constant problems with server, connection that brakes just in the middle of the raids. and of course ""free to play"" lie.",1
,5
"Somewhat addictive and charming, but often crashes when fast-forwarding.",3
Build times are a little long but it's a fun game to play if you're nostalgic for the old title. Minus one gratuitous star for microtransaction-mania.  Remember to slap those imps arbitrarily and often.,4
Good game,5
Fun,5
"I enjoy this game as a ""check in occasionally"" sort of thing. It's a nice little cross between tower defense (build defenses in strategic locations to stop the stream of evil minions from destroying you) and real-time strategy (harvest resources, upgrade units, attack the enemy). There are some improvements that could be made. Allowing multiple imps to work on the same project would provide more of a feeling of accomplishment, and a summary page would help you see what level everything is at a glance.",3
"Great game.  Can spend money, but not required.",5
Beyond simple greed.  This is shameful.,1
Wait times are the worst. If they weren't as bad as they are this game would be good.,2
it kinda sucks,2
I like it but summoning minions doesn't affect my count for the Overlord achievement. Stuck at 139 for weeks. :(,3
Its a really fun game..,5
Awesome,5
Need to fix,3
"I like the maze/puzzle campaign but I miss the time-based empire building aspect of the old game, which was more like original Warcraft or Age of Empires. Sadly, this edition regularly loses connection to the server, which can terminate a raid in the middle, and for event raids, you cannot easily restart them.",3
Fun time waster.,5
Great time killer,4
Great game.,5
"This is an ok game,I lowered my rating after it started crashing every time I went on a siege.. EA has a history of making bad games..",1
Awesome,5
Legit,5
,5
Worst game ever,1
I was excited for this until I found out it was free. It could be a good game if it wasn't free to play. If you like games where you always have to wait out the timers then this would be good for you. I would love the option to pay once and remove all of the paywalls.,2
"Fun game, it just takes patience.",5
Love the game. Would like more pve missions. Addictive fun.,5
Money holds you back,4
Holy pay or else Batman!,1
"The initial instructions are a little vague, but overall it's a great concept and easy to play",5
A lot of fun,5
Would be 5 stars if it didn't take so long to load. It also has an annoying habit of disconnecting during gameplay.,4
Fun,5
It's a blast,5
"Should be called ""wait and play"" because that's what it really is. Some actions take days to complete and even simple story mode levels require waiting to summon your army. Just buy the old games this is trash.",1
"Unlike other games, this one has the building and timing done right, making the experience enjoyable and gratifying.",5
Like it so far,4
I was really excited when I saw this as I grew up playing the desktop version and loved but I'm not impressed at all with this version really wish I still was able to play the oldskool version on my computer defiantly not impressed but I gave it 3 stars because it occupies my time,3
Same as title. :-p,5
Simply awsome!,5
A pity it is in free to play and not a full game we could buy,4
Electronic Arts is the typical greedy corporate american company. It would be a good game but its designed for you to spend money again and again and again....,1
Fun,5
easy to use,5
It is Un playable without in app purchases.,1
Its OK comparable to clash of clans...,3
Nothing like the old dungeon keeper... way to ruin another game EA,1
All-around awesome,5
"Hasn't asked me nor required me to pay money to continue playing, and this is unfortunately becoming more rare :/",4
Good game kinda like the computer version (SOMEWHAT) I would give 5 stars but the whole 1day dig and 15 hour training SUCKS BUT it is free so what more can u expect. Ps. Plz make a way to dig for or earn gems!,4
Even when I am on wifi I get disconnects during raids or events. That menas loose of all my troops for nothing. Together with long waiting times this absolutely kills game with such a big potential.,1
Its not as good as the original... ok tho,4
To much wait time and don't like that the imps cost gems that you can only buy or take 2 months getting by digging them up otherwise its a great game,4
Can't download it anymore,1
Great game but too many pay walls,4
Good game,5
Really fun is better than the other type of games like this,5
Really fun,5
I hate these long wait time. It is ridiculous,2
"Not what I expected but it is incredible!  Make your own dungeon and raid others, what more could you ask for?",5
Awesome game,5
"It's ok, but building the dungeon takes forever and gathering gems is either extremely slow or very expensive ($20 to summon a 5th imp?). I get on it for 3 minutes every 2 hours or so. Just to smack my imps and set them to a task, then I close it and play something else.  Update: An update or four everyday? I don't really want to wait for an update to download every time I open it.",2
really fun has lots of potential would be nice if you had some place to put buildings while you place new buildings and be able to get thru redesigns better,4
multiple actions take day or week to complete.  Not good for quick casual gaming.,1
Funny puns. I think its too expensive to get your next imp.,3
Great game but with annoying bugs. For example you get attacked and the game claim that you lost for example x% but dwhen you run the video of the fight you only lost y% . Support of course did ignore the ticket no response.,3
On my HTC evo 4g all it will let me do is look at the stone quarry,4
This is a fun game and is a great way to waste a few minutes here and there. There is a paywall so you wait a while for upgrades and such unless you buy gems. But it's worth a few minutes once and a while for free players,4
"Very good one, but i was excepting the old pc version",4
Was a very enjoyable pc game.  Good fun app. But expensive in game but still fun without $$,4
"The game play is too slow, as it take multie days to do upgrades to your room, traps, and defenses... consuming the time of your limites Imp reaource.  Expedition of the build times is far far far too costly for what you get.  The cost is a hige impediment to the enjoyment of the game, keeping you away from actively participating... download if you like watching tje seconds of your life tick away...",1
"Your app seems to have impeccable timing when reconnecting, as it only does it while I am raiding a dungeon. This has wasted many of my resources, and has prevented me from finishing the event raids. Also, it always cuts the event raids short at exactly the 8th wave. It has never allowed me to exceed this wave, and reconnects at the very start. Please find a way to fix this, as it only happens during a raid and has become an annoyance.",3
Good,5
Just started playing. Like it so far. Give more stars once I get further into the game.,3
Fun fun fun,4
Cant use the game now I finally got my torture chamber I cant even get on the game because it disconnects me immediately,1
Awesome!,5
Amazing game,5
Very fun and competitive,5
"Decent on the go, but I'll go back to DK2 for any real fun",3
This game is funny and fun,5
Dude.. I love this game:),5
"Not original. Very much like clash of clans and other games. Love the original dungeon keeper and still play it often, but I was bored with this game quickly.",2
Not  quite like the original... but still,5
Could be better,4
"Reminds me of the original for pc, loving playing it.",4
"Gave it three opportunities to work on my Samsung illusion, got slightly further each time, and phone froze and restarted. Expected better from EA, uninstalling",1
Pretty cool game interesting always something to do. Keep up the good work. :-),5
It is awsone,5
Fun,5
This game is soooooo amusing and very easy to pick up and learn,5
"Played the original, this reminds me a lot of it :-)",5
This is a great game with some good graphics  who ever reads this download this right now.,4
Yep,5
Fun game.,4
"I'd rather outright pay for a game, rather than having to pay and continue or wait 24 hours to for 1 imp task. Worthless. Although I will be cracking out the old pc game.",2
A some loved it,5
More,5
My only complaint is its insistence on knowing Google+ Circles and the selling of gems.  Come on EA - I'd rather you charged me for the game itself than backdoor us with the gems!  Lame!,3
If you want to kill someone's childhood this is how you do it.,1
Terrible,1
Too much of money sucking. Bette made SP that i can buy and forget about pay to play.,2
It's alot like the old dungeon keeper with minimal changes to account for being an app,5
When I was creating my guild lair it took 200 gems from me,2
"I've waited far too long for a new DK to be given this money hungry PoS. Thanks EA for proving time and time again you hate the art, and only love the bottom line.",1
This game is like clash of clans but dungeon keeper is even better!!!!,5
One of the most apps I've found so far on the market.,5
Lots of fun.  Reminds me of the old PC dungeon keeper.,5
Its fun evil clash of clans,5
I love the level up screen for the buildings,5
"Fun, similar to Castle clash",5
"Fun, but slow",4
"I played, and still do, this game for pc. I have to agree that it does take quite a lot of gems to recruit your next imp, and that the build times on certain rooms can be a painstaking journey. I am with those that do not want to have to drop hundreds of real money on this game. If they would offer a game pack that has 1 or 2 imps, gems and some resources for say 20 bucks it would be awesome. Still love the game tho",5
Need indicators in the guild to show donated minions per member and withdrawals per member to identify constant mouchers!!!! Very frustrating to constantly donate and see empty ressources. Tool should be available to guild leader. Also should be a visible message to members from leader on guild page when opened.,4
Very intertaining keeps you busy really like it so far,5
"Latest update eliminated force closes, making this a fun game again",4
Nothing but a money grab worth no real substance.,1
It's very fun and addicting,5
Game is very out of balance between attack and defend. The game also is to slow paced. I uninstalled because the pace just made it boring.,5
It plays so well,5
Cooooool,5
Lions Pizza dearborn Mi,3
,3
Plays great on my Huawei from metro PCS,4
"Unlike the original, but who wants to play the same game 3 times?",5
"Exciting game, great graphics.",5
Fun fun fun,5
I like this game it is addictive and fun.,5
Great game. Nice twist on original title to keep things interesting. Good guild system and playability at all levels.,5
Uninstalled on both phone and tablet,1
"The good: Great graphics.  Interesting to play.  Great community of players and opportunities to interact. Pretty funny.  The bad: 1) Obscenely expensive to play if you want to move faster than at a snails pace.  2) Some pretty major issues with connectivity - it often drops in the middle of actions, and you end up losing many points. 3) Recent updates make it very hard to play, but allow you to spend a tremendous amount of money to plug a never ending series of holes.  The ugly: If you have thousands of $ sitting around and don't want to go to Vegas to lose it .... well here's your chance.",3
Great remake,5
"I'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper, I'm chums with the dungeon keeper. -Dan bull",5
The lag from the game just cost me over 1k gems thanks a bunch for the non responsive system that crashes constantly what a way to waste money,1
"To get any wear in this game u have to spend,money",3
The developers keep changing how the fundamentals of  things work and it screws weeks of work planning up tired of logging in to find that yet again things have been turned upside down,3
Quick to learn fun to play,5
"Great game, can't stop playing",5
Diabolical,4
Its great but when starting out it kept blacking out,4
"Pay to play is not optional, at least insofar as getting through the tutorial level goes. You are required to buy the lowest level package of gems in order to fulfill purchasing an imp. There is no getting out of it.  Excavation/building/upgrading is grindingly slow, unless disproportionately vast quantities of purchased gems are expended. That would be okay, if gems were not so very expensive and the only way imps can be acquired, with rising costs for each one.  This would all be okay, still, if the game was any fun at all, or had any of the complexity of the original. It just does not, at all. It is not fun. It is slow, boring, makework, essentially setting up a few tasks for your five or six imps, gathering mined resources, and training, then shutting off the game for hours or a day. All this unfun ""play"" on a single small static square map, prepping for poorly implemented AI attacks and PVP on variations of the identical dungeon.   The best thing I have done so far is boot up a copy of DKII and played the real thing. Buying enough gems to buy six imps costs twice the original retail of DKII plus original DK.  Do not waste your time or money on this. JUST PLAY THE REAL THING.",1
Great game,5
I use to love playing DK on my PC.,4
Great game,4
Like the original.,5
It's a lot of fun to do. I have fun building my new dungeon. It's easily addicting.,5
Pathetic.,1
I like the little minons because I can slap the heck out of them,5
"Haven't been able to play in weeks, game crashes on galaxy tab 3 to home screen.   Between lack of ability to play and micro transactions, this game just plain sucks.",1
Like the p vs p but. Could make building your rooms and removing walls a bit easier.,5
The game is great but what sucks is that once you get your dungeon hooked up and you have all the stone and gold dug out it keeps saying please wait while your imps get you dungeon in order.. please fix this problem I like this game and I have 6 imps my heart is at level 8 and I want to play without the game freezing most of time,3
Fun,4
Open game dona few things for 5 min and check back in a few hours,3
Hummm. There is a 47 mb update that came out a few weeks ago. It won't stay updated every time I use a task killer it has to re update the same 47mb...it does not stay updated....never had issues before or now with other apps.,3
Fun,5
"Just started,  but I'm digging it.",5
Hey join silent shadows guild. Need members. New guild.,5
"Great ""on the go"" game. Pretty addictive",4
Amazing graphics. Fun play style. Very addictive.,5
Starting off I'm a huge fan of the dungeon keeper series. What I expected was a game that had the humor and depth of the old game.   What I got as a game that disappointed me.  The game feels like a cash grab from the start.  Everything you do is timed.  Slowly 10 mins then two hours then 8 hours then a day.  To the point where the two imps you have gotten are tied up for 2 days. While you wait you can do automated fight with only a small handful of spells and the minions start location to affect the fight.,2
Its good:Update it was working good but now I can't even connect at all anymore keeps giving me a can not connect errors. it back  to normal again and its stable,5
I love it,5
Nicely. Done,5
I would have liked a well done single player version better.,5
"Without comparing it to the original - great concept, fun graphics, humorous. But - the game has SERIOUS issues with multiplayer: the guild (search, recruiting, chat) and other minor bugs. Everytime I want to spend real money it crashes so I don't. That tells you how mixed can the feelings get with this game. EDIT: UPDATES CREATE CONFUSION, this game is getting worse... EDIT 2: being a leader of the clan is the only reason I still play this game, have no hopes for this game though. EDIT 3 - REALLY DONT BOTHER PLAYING IT",1
Could have been great but as usual EA screwed the pooch being too greedy.,1
"There are far too many cheating players in the game.  It is NOT worth the time to download, let alone play.  EA / Mythic does nothing to stop them, let alone reply to players with negative comments.  At this point I'd recommend that people do NOT play games by Electronic Arts OR Mythic.",1
Not too far yet but it seems really sweet.      :-),5
Nice refreshing wit and humor.,5
Awesome thanks,5
How did this garbage get 4 stars???,1
"Its very frustrating to start a raid only for the game to time out 30 sec in, display the ""reconnecting"" screen, and boot you out of the raid...iron those bugs out and this is a 5* app for sure",3
Dungeon Keeper is a great way for the professional time waster to sluff off for about 10-20 min at a time. Great graphics and sound and enough eye candy to keep most people happy. Would give a 5 star rating but there are some game play issues that pop up every now and then.,4
"Eh, somewhat entertaining.  Not much strategy involved",4
Good game just a time suck game. Play for 10 minutes and wait for 2+ hours.,3
Can be slow to build. . But still a lot of fun. Still not as good as dungeon keeper 3 from years a go.,5
Old.version good cuz didnt have to pay,4
So many updates now that make the game unbalanced.  Debating on the integrity of the game now..,3
"This game long wait times.  No point using doors, walls traps or taking the time to build defensively, once u get ghosts, they bypass all ur defenses. The only thing this game has been done is make me load and play the original game.  just another agame forcing you to spend cash to reduce ur wait time.",1
"not exactly what i had in mind, owned the computer version, so my expectations were high, besides the pay and play, pretty good.",5
Amazing game. Loved the original. Great on smartphone,5
Really good game,5
"Huge fan of DK, have it for the pc.",5
Lots of fun but costs way to much money to do anything quickly.,2
üòáleast when my tablet broke my game was not  N,4
"I hate how I have to wait DAYS to finish building something or I can buy ""gems"" with real money to hurry up. This game is fun but seriously loses steam quickly the higher you go. The game is very imbalanced and wait until you start to find enjoyment out waiting 5+ days to upgrade a building. This free to play genre is lame. Shame on you EA. You ruined another classic.",1
I don't think 9 and under kids should get this I recommend so kids your moms will say yep don't get this I don't think you will to don't install even if you did uninstall right now like me,3
"5 imps is the sweet spot. Cost me 7.99 and 19.99 before I realized what I was wasting my money on. Just buy 5 imps and never rush any jobs. This makes a perfect game on your phone. But, in order to really enjoy this game you have to pay money(buy the 5 imps). This is not a free to play. The payoff if you really tried to play for free is just to slow and frustrating to get emotionally attached. Final warning: Best phone game on the go, but be ready long waits in between builds. Gems system is totally broken.",3
"Is similar to clash of clans, but not as gay. Its awesome",5
I always loved tower defense and now this game gives that with a clash of clans play style so I get the best of both. Upgrade times are the best,5
Needs better gem rewards other than that FLAWLESS,5
"Unless you plan on spending money. I love how the ""Best Value"" is $100... Spend that money on a game worth playing, not one just trying to gouge you every turn you take.",1
Ex WOW players join guild LOYOLA. Oh yeah and this game is really great,5
Lol I always fined it funny when ppl hail a game for being a great idea this is a rip off of a old windows 98 game was a very good game but none the less this is a ripoff,4
No complaints here!,4
I am happy to see the classic games returning.,5
"I really enjoy playing this game. Good fun, a little bit of humor, and great gameplay. Well thought out.",5
"I was impressed by the designs and aesthetic of the dungeon,but was entirely disappointed at the pay-to-win system as players who played money would obviously overpower player who wait. However that wouldn't be the worst as the load times,lag, and raids failed due to error how dreadful. Don't bother 3 stars",3
Better if it was dungeon keeper2 would buy it,1
A nice throw back to the PC. But too slow to play without paying.,3
F2p does not work for this game. Its annoying that every time I do something it ask me to pay for faster results,1
The original PC game was devilishly great. This version is straight pay to play frustration.,1
Fun game but not a fan of the in game purchase system. Would be willing to pay $5 or $10 up front to play but will not be buying gems to speed things up.,3
I had the game on my PC back in the day. I love that I can play it again.,5
Interesting gameplay and funny mechanics,4
This is an awesome and funny game. Thanks!,4
Getting more annoyed as it seems like hackers are making this game not as enjoyable. Its either that or really glitchy on replays. But I see people spawn ling minions on a part of the base that isnt destroyed like a full health warehouse behind my main defenses. Game isnt that fun if people can do this. Plus even if I defend enough where they cant destroy my heart and they have 40% it sats in the end they are victorious with 70%+. Very annoyed.  Has happened a few times now.,2
Is the best dungeon game ever,5
"Had to reinstall today no clue why , More glitches crashed and asked for update 0\6 0kb \0kb  Uninstalled and can't reinstall... Other then alllll that still fun game if u can get it to play",4
My husband installed this on my tablet...,2
It's fun so far but I guess I'll run into everyone's gripes soon enough,4
Good game,5
Pay to play or I would give it 5  stars..,3
The game is tons of fun but they do everything in their power to take money from you and that's a bit obnoxious. The only way to play free is to wait awful long periods of time for upgrades and that causes you to not enjoy the game since you can only play for ten minutes a day while waiting. Otherwise spend big bucks.,4
Couldn't even start got stuck at the name your dungeon screen,1
Very fun and entertaining,5
Too much time to dig,3
It was kind of fun building your dungeon thinking it actually gonna do anything when it comes to stopping invader. It doesn't. I just watch a replay to see the other player used 2 wall bomb to blow 6 rows of tile + reinforced wall ( each bomb takes out 3x3 tiles) and blow a path straight to my room. What the hell is the point of placing doors and traps and walls when it doesn't do jack. Time to move on.,1
Fun,4
Super creative and fun !,5
Fun for a few days then impossable to play without cash. Talkin a hundred bucks,1
Sweet,5
"Way too many micro transactions and wait times that can only be solved with micro transactions. I understand you need to make money but if a game is designed to pay pay pay or you can't play it takes the fun out of it. If money were taken out of this game completely and I was charged $15 for a working game that didn't hound my bank account this would probably be the best mobile game I've ever seen. Also, continue to patch you greedy punks.",2
Really addictive gameplay. Love it but patience is needed to fully appreciate it.,5
Very good game. Great way to pass the time,5
"Good graphics, always updating and improving game, recommend it.",5
Good game,4
I just wish it did allow my tablet to sleep. Beeing woken up to that voice telling me that I'm under attack is not the best alarm clock.,4
Horny is awesome,5
"This game is great, it's a very fun game, and it's actually pretty funny too, it has it's similarities to Clash of Clans, but it's by no means a ripoff, there are a lot of differences between the two, but I can see it was at least inspired by it.",4
Very fun easy to get into and lose track of time,5
Loved these games since the start,5
"Fun like the original. Same obstacles as any ""free-to-play""; time, money or both. Still it's well made and very fun.",5
The game is good but it takes so unbearably long to do things (upgrading structures takes anywhere from 1 hour to 4 days) and to start you can only upgrade 2 structures at a time. Also the game is constantly auto updating. 45 MB each time pretty much daily. Even if you set your phone to update large files ONLY over WiFi the game will STILL auto update over 4G whether you like it or not. Say bye bye to your download quota. The game has potential but is nowhere near it.,3
Love it,5
"Super fun, kind of like the classic except now I can take it on the go.",5
Great,5
Self explanatory.,1
"Not as good as the original PC games, but great humor and fun",5
Its great,5
Very fun,5
"EAs classic model of time waster game with massive wait times for every little thing and almost immediately asks you to pay for the premium currency. But they have gone one step further this time and taken an amazing old title game and bastardized it in this way. A tragedy and a money grab. Don't download, don't pay.",1
The gameplay is nice but it glitches up every once in a while keep up the good work your doing great,4
I cannot even start a raid with out it crashing in less than 25 seconds. Unplayable. It even crashes when viewing videos of attack. Asus TF101,2
Fun and engagin,4
"Waiting days to get anything done takes away from DK experience. I only downloaded while waiting for War for the Overworld to come out for PC and because I wanted to support a franchise I loved when I was younger but this isn't the game I was hoping for and am tired of waiting hours...days...weeks...to dig, build and upgrade. Raids are okay but waiting forever to regain Mana and Summon troops just adds to an endless waiting game that I no longer want to play.",1
Everything is awewome everything is awesome win ur part of the team!!!!!!!!!!,5
Needs a way to protect gems(the primary resource which costs real money) from disappearing because there are no confirmations to stop mistaps from spending hundreds of them. 500 gems cost 5 real dollars and that can disappear in 3 seconds without asking if you want to spend them. I played this game for a few months and when I had a problem and submitted a ticket nobody would help with anything. Worst game I have ever spent money on,1
I'm having fun..,3
Fun,5
Its so cool you can build  a maze,4
"I give two stars for what this game *could* be.   The latest update changed key defense items so that they are utterly useless w/o spending huge amounts of extra resources.  The mobile version was already deeply marred by greed, but it's getting even worse instead of better. Because I don't have $100s to spend, it's now more of a waiting game instead of a game I get to play.",2
"I have no problems with this game it's awesome, sure things start to take time but all games like this do. P.S. new guild ""The Unburdened"" looking for members.",5
DAZOMBOSS SAID THIS COOL,5
Fun! Evil! I'm hooked!,4
"I made a purchase and did not receive my gems and had to spend days emailing tech support to finally get the gems I bought.  They did add 10% to my order as compensation. Other than that the game is great, I love the idea of the login to boost your builder's speed. Troop AI is good, lots of cool spells to use when attacking.",5
"A departure from the ""babysitting"" casual mobile games. Just enough engagement and challenge to make it a long-term time waster. I keep coming back.",5
To play enjoyable beyond the first a half an hour you really need to spend at least $50 for 'gems'; $100 'the best value' might last for just a couple of days of intense playing.,1
Its not how I remember the game as a kid but still enjoyable.,4
Just like on the pic with enough updates,4
Decent pacing.  Just takes time,4
Some of the most fun I've had on my phone,5
There have been a few errors...specially since last update I've been stuck on the checking for updates page. Even after close and rebooting and clearing cache and a reinstall. Other than that I've had no issues. Still an awesome game.,3
Everything is so slow and force you to spend real money. All battles are biased towards money wasters.,1
Thisis a great game.,4
Excellent defense AND attack strategy game that is non-linear (enemies don't walk down one road or across screen). Amusing as well. Real money is only needed to play faster and more often. You can win and progress just as well with no money. I think people that say otherwise just don't understand how to play. I've not given a game 5 stars before.,5
"Reminiscent of the original DK and DK2 for pc, once you get set up it doesn't take long to play each day.",5
"If you're looking for a game you check in on a couple times a day, you'll enjoy this. The timers are way too long to play actively.",3
This game would be awsome if it actually worked. In the last month I have only gotten to play it for about 30 min becase it won't connect to the server. To bad cause I really like it!,1
"What makes Dungeon Keeper so maddening is how close it is to being a fun game. Apart from the pure nostalgia, they have brought back the same voice to narrate the game. The game has shifted from the classic PC game, but is still a good tower defense concept game.  What went wrong?  At least three things: first, the game is buggy and crashes at inopportune moments. When you commit your forces to raiding another dungeon, it sometimes loses connection with the server. Second, the game takes a very long time to load, which wouldn't be so bad except for the next issue.  Third, and most notoriously, they have made this game so you can only play a little bit at a time unless you want to cough up a bunch (and I mean a BUNCH) of money.  Everything costs money -- imps, progress on rooms, gold, stone, boosts -- you name it.  Or, you could just wait a few hours (or days) and play again then.  Please, EA.  Give us the option of paying a reasonable fee to just play the game . . . or before long I fear no one will.",3
I played the original Dungeon Keeper games in the 90's.  This is an excellent update/upgrade to the original bullfrog games.   Only thing I don't like is that you must pay real money to progress. And it takes forever to build your lair. I foresee this taking a century to get your third imp.  Might as well pull up a chair cuz you'll be here a while.  ZzzZzz,2
Yet the game takes a long time to progress,3
A lot of info right in Your face very quickly...,4
im on a top 3 guild...now with updates ppl cast 2 bolts and destroy entire base. they now put players with good strategy up against ppl who pay to upgrade everything to force us to pay to be able to keep up....nice tactic great game turned to a joke.,1
One of those easy to pick up dungeon games that is very entertaining?,5
"If you like throwing money at a game, this one is for you! To get anywhere significant to be able to play the game you quite literally have to 'invest' hundreds of dollars just to get you there. The rest is a slow painful process to do it. Once you've unlocked some of the stuff to make it more playable for nostalgia sake, the game gets kinda fun as a tower defense/ resource mgmt game. I'm giving it 1 star because of the money gouging from the vendor it implies on joe user",1
Need more imps for free. Dont like how they trick or force you to buy more..sad,5
I love this game.,5
BEST GAME EVER :-),5
"While I was excited to see this old friend appear on Android I've become disheartened by just how much you need to pay to be successful. Earning gems is nigh on impossible and, if you don't want to get pummeled, you're going to have to cough up to get on.   If EA dialled down the cost of gems by 50% (or more) it'd attract a more casual gamer to play more consistently. Either that or improve the mechanics/rewards to make the raids a more attractive way to gain them too.   Right now the costs are more than a",1
Better than clash of clans,5
Its just plain fun its all I can say,5
"I remember when this first came out for the PC. Fun back then and fun now.  It takes way too long to upgrade all the rooms,mining, etc... but the smiles remembering the good ol' imp slapping days of our youth.",4
Lots of fun . Save those gems for your first imp.. makes a huge difference,5
Love the script in the game. But it needs a group message alert and a donation score to show who's still playing. -Thank you,5
"Not for the easily butt hurt, you will be attacked in this game. The real fun comes with pitting your strategic mind against the rest of the world. Your going to attack me, sure, but will you get past the front gates?",5
Fun game,5
,4
Cool game,5
This game has many fun aspects to it but it also has many bugs. Most of the time the game won't even load completely due to some ridiculous error.,1
Great way to pass the time,4
Poor cash grab based on an awesome game.  Typical EA garbage.,1
"I played the original dungeon keeper games and while this is quite different in certain ways, it's also still dungeon keeper and it's friggin great!",5
It takes a long time to do things and its too expensive get minions without buying them with real money.  Most everything else is ok. Just some buildings take forever.,3
Love it,5
"Still playing so had to give extra stars but Seriously,  this game is the biggest money grab I have ever seen. To truly be able to play this game at a speed greater than a snails pace you have to drop cash. This game is nothing like Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2.",3
"This version of dungeon keeper varies drastically from the original two titles, but it has been excellently remade for mobile. It's a very fun and exciting game, with lots to do. The micro transactions are a bit daunting and unwelcome, but are not required for patient t players. All in all an awesome title.",5
Everytime I go and play this game it crashea my phone 10 seconds later.,3
Just wish you didn't have to buy gems to do pretty much anything in less than a week,3
"In game transactions are ridiculous, game repeatedly screws you out of wins by losing connection at the wrong time, rules are constantly changing, and everything takes forever. Otherwise it's pretty fun.",2
Fun to play but the need for 'persistant internet' means only playing when wifi is available :-/ Guild integration isn't the best.,3
Very addicting game but more things ways to get gems too hard buy come by when u don't have enough money to buy it,5
"Nothing like 1 and 2, I loved those games this one is a horrible port. Thanks for killing the franchise.",1
Best must get 1000000% better than clash of clans,5
This game is amazing mostly adults play and its more fun then clash of clans and you never have to pay into the game all you have to do is dig lol join our guild if your new and want advice on how to play the game Were Death Seems to Dwell,5
"You guys did a great job balancing game play after the last update, but idk if it's a bug or no, but people were able to deploy minions in the middle of my dungeon without even destroying a building first. What's up with that?",3
No control of game right from the start. No way to skip any initial game play or instructions. Nothing is saved. EULA comes up minutes into the game to sign everything away. No understanding of costs since you can spend as you wish in the beginning. I loved Dungeon Keeper. This is no Dungeon Keeper. You should be absolutely ashamed.,1
"Its really fun and holds your attention, brings new challenges and is amazing, not as good as the PC version but for a free touch screen app its amazingly awesome. Still playing through the new updates and still really fun.",5
Great game,4
It‚Äôs a potentially great game that was completely butchered into unplayability by maddening mobile trends that don‚Äôt mesh with the core concept of the game,1
"This game could be alot of fun. But glitches, lagging, and the 30 second loading times to find a dungeon to raid take all the fun out of it. It takes a full minute just for the game to load! You would think the constant upgrades of 40mb or more would fix some issues.",1
My last battle was at 7%...then magically at the end went to 39% and my dungeon heart destroyed...ummm shenanigans???,4
Just takes so long to do anything even at lv 9 guild but other than that its great,4
Very enjoyable,4
Cool game,5
"Freezes in battle sometimes, scores come out wrong sometimes so you can win a battle and it will say you lost, In guild chat the keyboard on my phone won't pop up half the time so I can't participate, and pairs me up against dungeons with no resources to gain from invading often, and with the reinforced wall update its hard to get stone now because everyone uses it all on their walls... And lame that you can pay money to win against others giving an unfair advantage..",2
"Way better than clans or castle clash, those games are to""cute"",DK is right up my ally more evil, twisted and fun yes it does take some time to upgrade stuff but it's worth it to wait for a torture chamber or a unholy temple, and the voice of horny is so cool,UPDATE! Still one of my favorite games but the waiting for stuff to finish is just stupid, why does it have to cost so much gems to finish building early c'mon, stop raping us and shorten the times to finish building/upgrading stuff",3
Top of the line game. I look forward playing this game everyday. Love the challenge and love slapping my imps!,5
"I was a huge fan of the PC games back in the day, so I was super excited to see the game on the app store. I play daily and love it. It isn't exactly the same as either PC game was, but you can't expect that from an app made for tablets and other mobile devices. But I still love it.",5
"Says I need to update the app but play says its up to date, so I cant play, dont want to uninstall for fear of loosing my dungeon",1
Solid game. I like it.,5
If you keep this game past the tutorial I promise you great fun if you are a fan of tower defense games.,5
"The game has become more stable. As long as you are either patient or free with your cash, it's fun. Remember as you're buying those gems, DK2 can be picked up for $6. Is this worth more than DK2?",3
Constantly disconecting. Some features are stuck like the guilds,1
"Spending gems on frivolous things is too easy, and often happens by accident. There is no warning, or opt out. The screen pops up while doing other things, making it incredibly difficult to avoid accidentally spending all your gems on gold or stone you can't even store.",3
I think this is better then clash of clans. Just my opinion!!! Keep it up.,5
"The pay-to-play aspect of this game is very heavy handed.  As you progress, you're forced to either pay for resources to upgrade your dungeon or forced to raid.  Current game design allows for other players to raid your for hard earned resources.  There is a cap to how much you can lose but the cap can be worked around by not doing too much damage to your dungeon.  This game also requires you to be always online which is a bad design decision.  The game is also plagued with disconnects and will disconnect you if it finds you idle.  Everything points to EA publishing this as a money making scam and not as a fully polished homage to the original.  Decisions like not being able to reset a dungeon (their workaround is to get another Google account), not being able to delete rooms and others reek of laziness in design.  I keep playing it for the dungeon building factor but I sense that the limitations of solo play and free-to-play aspects of the game will have me soon seeking another game.  Worth downloading to see if you like it but not any better than any other game on the market and in some ways worse.",2
The constant connection sucks battery power and a small interruption makes you lose raids.,1
Great game easy . Just like pc dk,4
"Crashes a lot since last update, has no way to keep any of your resources safe, and as such you need to use cash to play to upgrade anything (either to keep raiding or to buy resources )",3
"Overall, very solid game. I enjoy very much",5
Fun and a great time consumer,4
Really enjoying this game. I've noticed that occasionally Ill survive an attack only taking 30 %. When the ending screen comes up it says defeat %38 when my dungeon heart was untouched. Please look into this.,5
Fun game,5
Do not DL,1
But when it comes to naming your dungeon or guild it gets annoying because the keyboard doesn't pop up most of the time and if you make a mistake you have to start all over and the keyboard doesn't want to work and its stressful but it is an addictive game,4
Fun. Nice and proper waste of time.,4
Amazing game,5
It runs really well on my galaxy 3 and is pretty fun,5
This is a pretty good game. Down side is then need to give out more gems,5
When you have to go back to a game many times a day it shouldn't take so long to start up.,1
Love it old computer game classics,5
Plays well. Love the scoring,5
Liked the tutorial and will continue to play more,4
I love this game.  Wish i didn‚Äòt have to pay to get upgrades.  :-),4
Awesome game keeps me on my toes fun fun,5
Love this game very entertaining. But stay away if you dont want to be addicted lol,5
Great app!,5
"This game is really great, BUT there are terrible networking issues. I want to love this game but I am having about 50% disconnection rate during raid. Soooo frustrating. If this gets fixed, I would give it 5 stars...",2
"The games is pretty good, but I  keep getting disconnected in the middle of the special raids (4 times now).  When I reconnect it wants me to pay to retry.",4
I have this game on both my galaxy tab and galaxy note yet try to play and my tab crashes or my note freezes ram is not the issue nor is my specs to play this game i worked through the tutorial just fine but it crashes and freezes when getting to the naming of my dungeon fix it please id like to keep app and rate EA better than this but this is horrible,1
"A great game with an old school feel, Dungeon Keeper is a great app",5
"Dungeon keeper used to be  real game, not a wait-or-pay trick. Charge me for a real game, don't try to bore me into giving you money for advancement in a non-product.",1
Nabbed,5
"You would think that a game made in 2013 would be superior to a game made in the 90s, but no. This is easily one of the worst games that i have ever played. This game would be much better and much more fun if there were no micro transactions and no real time waiting. I'd much prefer buying a version similar to this one for the phone WITHOUT micro transactions and waiting.",1
"I've played many strategic games, this one is a refreshing change of pace.",5
Game keeps crashing while trying to build stuff. Took advantage of buying gems and get a free goblin and lost the goblin.,1
Keeps the old school dk feel with a mobile twist. Get ready to buy the game. Its similar to clash of clan style play.,5
Do you like waiting? Load screens? Status bars? Patches while you wait? This is the game for you! A promising game with some fun bits ruined by sooo much loading...,3
"I love this game, it's such a fun time waster. But sadly, mine glitches so it never reconnects to the server, making it unplayable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, maybe that will help. Still a fun game, i just wish i could play it.",3
I like the have it is very addictive.,5
Had do update everyone I try to play takes ten minutes I have 4G lte on my galaxy s4 way to long a wait time I wait to see if you fix it if not I'm a uninstall,1
Takes very long to do things but very fun especially with the right guild. Good game for the patient and goal orientated.,4
I quit playing clash of clans when I found this game.,5
Decent nostaliga trip playing off a great classic series.,4
I rate this app,5
"I was a kid who's dad worked in IT and he enjoyed gaming as well (obviously) and when I played DK on our old 95 I thought it was hilarious fun, now I had the great excitement of finding it here and its just as good as it was back then HOWEVER I don't ever like the whole purchase to speed up concept. It feels like you waving a price tag in my face :P",5
"Great game, runs perfect on galaxy note 2",5
"Good game, but I don't understand why I have to pay $100 to play. In purchase games suck. Why not just charge for the full game itself, instead charging for the tools you need to play. 2 stars until I can purchase full version.",2
I start the game and I play for a couple of minutes and then the game stops it won't let me play anymore!,2
Pretty fun game!,4
"I used to enjoy this game.  Characters no longer follow the path's as advertised, items and spells are constantly changed to a lesser state.  I'm about one ""improvement"" away from removing this one.  Definately not spending any more money.",1
"I really like playing this game. I wish you could keep your fighters after a battle instead of having to get more all the time. Also, I wish it didn't cost so much to upgrade and get more minions. You could have a kickass dungeon with awesome fighters.",3
Good so far,5
"This game is fun to play, But you have to buy too many gems and it's slow to progress. Really not worth my time to play.",1
Its a good game,5
For all those that complain about the expensive gems just wait! I have a great dungeon and haven't spent a penny on it!,5
Awesome  game great sounding,5
A dungeon that keeps on giving. Well played and can keep you busy for hours on in.,5
Waited 5 minutes for  it to load: nothing happened. It should not take that long to start a game.,1
The new update has rendered the raids completely unplayable due to the constant and random disconnections that throw you back into your dungeon and results in a DEFEAT and a loss of minions and precious mana.  I give up on raiding until the next (and hopefully fixed) update,1
I try to update it but it won't work,2
"That's all this game is, microtransactions. You can't do anything without paying and the prices are outrageous.",1
Super fun game.,5
I cud not play it,1
I havent had this much fun in years.,5
Seems ok,4
Fun. Been looking for a game like this for a while,5
Good way to kill time,4
,5
Love it its just twisted enough for a person like me,5
Awful,1
"This game overall is a great game for the casual strategist gamer. :-) not recommended for the faster paced gamer unless your willing to pay, but the pay to play does not rule over the game as everything can be done in due time and most time can be halved by slapping your imps around a bit :-P so far the game has not disapointed with the graphics and voice acting, not to mention the games own personalized notification letting you know when something's done or needs tending to when  your not on the game!",5
Simplified version of PC game.  Wish they would release game for playstation 4.,5
"Passes the time when bored, imp speed for walls is a pain but other than that is good",5
Not quite like the original game but its ok playing.,3
Best game EVER!!!!!!!!!!,5
Captures the feel of the old dungeon keeper games although it does grind a bit on my phone.,4
Game is almost unplayable.  Crashes durning raids.  Crashes while viewing own base,1
-updates remove buildings and abilities. Replaces them with more expensive versions that take longer to acquire. -about 75% of raids end up with me being 'disconnected' even though I am on WiFi. No other live games suffer like this. -Takes a long time and a lot of attention to get anywhere. Another frustrating title from EA.,2
An awesome game,5
"Genuinely enjoying this game. Thank you, Mythic!",5
The only reason you get 4 stars not five is because if you go on a battle or raid and don't use all your guys they get used .,4
Awesome app. Not as good as DK for the pc but still rocks!!,5
Fun game,4
"It's nice to be able to play a game that doesn't require you to spend money in order to enjoy the game.   Of course spending money does make things faster, but you can still play and have fun without spending.   I haven't played any of the other DK's, so now that I've played, and enjoyed this one, I do believe that I will try the others.   Thanks EA.",5
One of the better tower defence type games I played,4
Great game best game ever,5
The game changs to moch to where game play is diffrent all the time  I get the egg   not being to do.3x3 on pvp in a way but not on campan.   So if u like games that the game play chages every two monts grate then but its hard to set ur stuff up the way u need it to when u do drastic game changs . You should tell us fist or let there be a vote on it! Grate game at frist but this is not the bata its the whole game stop changing it and make the 2dungon keeper game,2
Unbalanced gameplay. Game will nickel and die u to death with its microtransactions. Gems are too few and take forever to mine. Minions will not defend your dungeon when getting attacked. This is just a money grab for EA. I would play the original pc game anyday over this version.,1
Very fun....,5
"The game started  out okay, with the normal wait-and-play style.  About halfway through various parts of the dungeon, the wait times are ~6 days each.  More imps does not sufficiently reduce the real-time wait with any significance.  You can also be attacked multiple times a day, losing more resources than your producing mines actually create, making any later-game upgrades difficult.  All-in-all, it is clear that the developers do not have the gamer's interest at heart in the least.",1
I enjoy this game but why is the word connect being censored in guild chat?  also is there a way to restart you dungeon?,4
Iv been looking for the pc version for years never could find it now theres the app ooo man its like child memories all over again great game plY and design to making the old time dk but mixed with the new world great job you guys,5
"Very well done. It's not the original, but good enough.",4
Really fun game,5
Terrible,1
OK so far cool concept,3
"You could of had something big with a mobile dungeon keeper!! With the mass mobile online this game could of made dungeon keeper 3 on the pc be reality! All you had to do is copy the game play from the original 1,2 (you did! awesome!) And nail online multiplayer (Not bad besides reconnecting issues!) And charge a flat rate to play!! (MEGA FAIL!!!) Now I wait here working my way up a ladder passed by people who buy very expensive gems because they dont want to wait 5 days for a upgrade!",1
Just got the newest update and had my spells and defense up.  Now my bomb spell is back to only blowing up one block.  Is every update suppose to take away the progress you have made so far?  Instead of taking away perks shouldn't you add more.  I am confused and I am one of the players that doesn't mind spending but why spend if they just take away after?,2
Love it!,5
Fun app,5
Loved it on pc and liking it on phone too,5
Games that are freemium are kinda annoying just charge 15.00 and let us have an even playing field against those that don't mind blowing tons of real currency to be the most powerful.,3
,4
Fun for hours! Good time killer.,5
Entertaining,4
"Chat constantly is vanishing.  Doesn't work well on my HTC one but okay on my tablet.  Object is to build a dungeon, dig out sections, level up rooms and minions, raid and be bad.  Join Cosa Nostra guild if you play...",2
A lot of fun.,5
Sort of a Warcraft defense game.  Fun.,5
Love the graphics,5
Like The Mighty quest for Epic Loot.,5
THE BEST GAME EVER,5
New game rules sucks,1
"This game requires you to pay out of pocket for it to be any level of fun. I'd rather pay to own a game entirely than nickel and dime my way through one. Very disappointing, I loved the original game.",2
Love this game,5
,3
Brings back memories of the old DK. Similar but slower.,3
"3 days in. So far, so good",4
Hooooooooo  It is fun but long,5
Great game. Needs to stay free but it is way fun and stuff.,5
This is a fun game,5
I love this game..you get free gems to boost ur lair.sumtimes i wish i had a bit more space tho.great to kill time while i wait on upgrades for clash of clans,4
Love this game!!! Anyone who remembers the PC version will truly enjoy!!,4
Good app,5
Can't get it to pass the title screen.  Kicks me out after waiting several minutes.,1
Great game worth 5 stars but im only giving it 4 for some reason i cant purchase my third imp ive saved enough gems but the option for purchase doesnt appear please fix and ill give 5 star with 5 thumbs up,4
Worked great for a few weeks then something got screwed up.,2
Ok. Basically a typical android game where you have to wait for everything or pay. Not exactly like the original which I was a huge fan of. But I guess it's kinda nostalgic.,3
Scam.,1
The persistent Internet is a problem. Not gonna use data 24\7 to keep this up to date but I'd I don't it takes an hour to load.  I get a few minutes here and there to play so I can't wait for it to load and I use a MOBILE phone. Not a phone that's always in my house with an available connection.,2
It's fun. I had this game on my computer awhile back. First comp. Game I had that I've seen transfer to phone successfully,4
Very fun. Very stimulating,5
"I had forgotten just bow much fun this game was back on pc, but now it's in your pocket O:-). It's like a childhood dream wish come true. Great game, tons of fun. Keep it up EA, you might just get back in my good graces.",5
It makes me feel like I'm playing a fun game on my phone so I really like this game I give it a farce 5 star rating,5
This app is awesome you build you dongeon up and fight others its simple and fun,5
Awesome game. Im definetly going to keep playing,5
this game is great for strategy you must know the perfect place to put traps,5
But problem in getting new level.,5
Nice game but very slow paced,4
,5
Bout time,5
Fun game,5
Nice,5
I loved the computer version of this game,5
Great game,5
A1 3d graphics,5
Little bit laggy no way to get free gems except for digging one spot for 4 hours,3
The limiting feature in this game (gems) makes this game unplayable without forking over your cash.  This game is definitely not free to play. Do not bother,1
Money grab,1
When it started to take 4days to construct a building I decided to quit. Its another pay to win type of game.,2
Keeps me waking up at least every hour. Great game..... addicting,5
Not to bad in beginning but now higher level people raid my dungeon over and over making it impossible to build up. Only thing you can do is throw real $$$ at it.,1
Very good. Strategy required,5
Three for now,3
Really enjoy it,4
Game play is good but the developers keep changing the rules of the game and if you lose data connection while in combat it is an instant loss.  They need to allow combat to complete even if data connection is lost.,2
Its a fun build and upgrade and take over game its like clash of clans and castle clash but better :) the only down side is that you can't restore soft rock that you mine,5
,5
Love it,5
Good good swhapoopie,5
"The old DOS one was a great one, it was better than this. This is stupid, nothing like the old one. Nice try EA.",1
Been working on nothing but 1 spell for weeks and use it today and it's area affect dropped down to 1 tile from a 3x3 tile. Much lame ness,2
This game is awesome but the time is mess up the cumputer version is slightly better,4
Yaaaaa,4
Would be better if I could log on more often it will not connect 90% of the time.,4
I really an loving this game!!!,5
Its a great app,5
This game is fun to play,5
Controls are easy to use,5
"Couple minutes a day,  seems to build nicely",4
Nice,4
But you need to work on that sometimes when people raid your dungeon it will give them 100% for destruction even if they only destroy 46%,5
Fun game I like it very much.,5
EA ROCKS,5
Games really fun it's good to see something original for once,5
I can't put in a name no name no stairs,1
Love the original games,5
"What happened to the wall bomb spell? I leveled it up to a 3x3 area and now its only doing 1 tile! I love this game but they keep changing thing! It's not broke, STOP TRYING TO FIX IT. EA is only making it worse with these so called updates... Fun to play but don't get too used to something, they will change it in 2 weeks!",5
"Fantastic game! ONE complaint though. When I get attacked, the summary says Defeat 54% (for example) and I lose many resources. When I watch the replay, however, the attack only defeated me by 15%. PLEASE FIX THIS! IT'S NOT ACCURATE!",4
To fun to put down,5
"Chicken Bomb spells seem to be Broken in replays, my recent replays I've sat all the way thru, mostly taking 0% damage to my dungeon, then defeat screen pops up saying my dungeon took 72%+/-, kinda hard to make improvements when I don't know how I'm getting beaten",4
love  the game,5
Fun game gotta try,5
"Absolutly. This is by far one of my fave games on Android. The narration is awesome, and the game is made by one of my favorite designers Peter Molyneux. Try this out!",5
,4
I am so happy this is an app!,5
I love this game.,5
"I was a fan of the old PC game and I'm hugely disappointed in how slow, expensive and unplayable this is without spending lots of money on gems.  That said, I keep playing...",3
This is not dungeon keeper. It is only misleading. In addition to a game where you wait for days or spend hundreds of $.,1
THIS AWESOME TOTAL NOT A  COPY,5
"Hey jerks, i just want to play the game and it's campaign. I have never signed into anything and i still get attacked. I don't want to play this game with other people, i hate them. Some little pud comes along with more time on his hands and screws crap up for me. Why is my game available to other people? I didn't want this. I just want to play the game in peace. I really should have a choice. Again i hate people, don't want to play with them. If i buy some stupid gems, would that make it worth while?",3
Too much donate,4
Pretty awesome game just wish imps were not so damm expensive,5
Yay,5
Good game....,4
lacks the style of gameplay from the original. other than that its awesome,4
Fun fun fun,5
Very good game I like it,5
The reaction time is a bit cluncky but overall great game.,4
This game is so much fun. Think ill be playin this one for awhile. Good job guys and gals who made this,5
Good game but needs new demons,4
Just started & so far so good,4
Its fun its addictive and its not time consuming!,5
"Way to ruin an amazing franchise for me. Why not remake the classic version... I would have paid for that. Ohh I forgot you only make stupid pay to play games now that suck stupid people into paying money for stupid gems. Also make it take days of time to clear space to build stuff. It's just like every other pay to play game. You should go on YouTube and watch Hitler reacts to Dungeon Keeper mobile.  We're done EA... it's not me, it's you. Bullfrog is rolling in their grave.",1
Sometimes it can be a bit long winded to play but I don't get bored,5
This won't work on my lg  motion. When i reach the to  Summon another minion The icon or button won't show up and remains blank. Please fix this .,2
"They give you a lot of gems at the start. This allows you to speed up everything, once these run out it is a huge money sucking game. Trying to play for free is like peeling your eyeballs with a pair of dull tweezers. Everything takes a huge amount of time. Then someone comes around, wipes youout and you have to start all over again.  It keeps dropping its connection to their servers, even if you are sitting next to your wireless router and have a 100% signal.  The graphics are very nice. Don't play this on a cheap or older tablet. This is very similar to the old pc game.",2
Good Game Funny Voice Ha,5
Very fun,5
I really like playing his game!,5
Decent game but the timers are ridiculous and aimed at making you spend an arm and two legs to progress quickly through the game,3
Its nothing like the original dongeon keeper games. They slowed down the game by adding jems and having to buy jems to make things go faster.,1
"Love the game, hate the fact that during the middle of the night when I'm sleeping, my galaxy tab keeps talking to me with the Dungeon Keeper's voice... Very creepy... I shouldn't have to turn my tablet off to turn the notifications off. Under game settings, there's NO settings, NO volume control?? ... Are you serious??? Uninstall...",2
Haven't found anything wrong,5
This has been my all time fave game since I was like 9 and I find it on android and it won't let me finish tutorial. Like wtf just let me summon an imp and let me play the game. Or add a skip tutorial feature plz.,3
I loved this game on pc. The move to mobile is great! LG F6,5
Game seems fun. But hours to days to complete tasks? You have a few minutes of play time and then forget about it. If you  are spending money then what's the point?,3
This is the best game Ever!!!!!,5
As fun as the originals.,5
Just started playing but interesting so far.,5
Every time i load the game up it will do one of the two things to waste your time. Load for a second and say there is a error or load up to the game play until you have to get an extra imp but you cant get it then you cant back out of the store. Ea please fix those problems i really want to play it.,1
Expensive to do anything!,1
Great game ea really out did them selfs,5
I love this game... Slapping the imps is an awesome perk...,4
Doesn't stay connected all the time so reloads all the time,3
If you're not willing to shell out some cash you can only spend a couple minutes playing every day and the rest of the time you're just waiting for things to finish. On the positive side the graphics are pretty great.,2
The latest update ruined the game.  There is no competitive balance in the game anymore.,1
Nothing like the original just a pay to play,1
"Save your time money and interest , this is just another pay to play copy of existing games and doesn't really deserve the Dungeon Keeper name. Go and support other developers that actually want to resurrect the Dungeon Keeper game that EA doesn't have the interest in supporting.",1
I love it,5
Very addictive!!!,4
"Nice game, I totally feel like its fair and I'm a free player.  Really loved ALL the dungeon keeper games.  I'm gonna play this one for a while. :) maybe even send em a few bucks for keepen DK alive!",5
Its fun but they have made gameplay too slow unless you buy tons of gems. That would not be so bad if gems were not astronomically priced. I would not have dropped 100$ on the full pc game  so I am certanly not going to for a mini version.,3
So far I like it. Finally original,4
All I need to say great,5
Loved both Dungeon Keepers for PC and love this for android!,5
Love it,5
Love it,5
This is a pay to play game.,1
Not as good as I was led to believe.,2
Need to be able to turn them off! Every time I hear it I want to smash my phone to pieces!... then burn down EA headquarters (not really). They are RUDELY INTRUSIVE AND ANNOYING AS WELL AS A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT!   FIX IT!,1
"Business model for these apps is not appealing to me. I would rather pay a one time fee for the app then to have to buy this and that along the way.   Also game needs offline mode, signal is not available everywhere regardless of carrier.",3
Plenty 'O' fun. 'Nough said.,5
It is amazing,5
This game is excellent it is very fun,5
Love it.,5
Every time I try to attack someone it says imps are working on it fix it and I'll change my review,2
"Its a fun game, slow to learn hard to edit but fun to play, pimp slapping your imps makes me laugh every time. Good game worth downloading",4
Game is next to impossible to play due to constant notifications about dropped network.,2
This game is the perfect blend of tower defense and rts! Great game!,5
"Fun, witty, do yourself a favor and get this game, :)",5
Best game ever and happy it was remade,5
Know it kills time,5
"Reads your friends list from G+, won't play offline, and asks for way me permissions than are needed fire a game.",1
You wont put it done,5
Fun,5
Cool,5
"I'm not even a dungeon guy, but this game is addictive.",5
Needs a restart option.,4
It's sets n looks for an update forever,2
It's a pretty cool game seems like something i could get into.,4
Its ok,3
"Have been playing this game non stop since i found it back in Jan, its a good remake very addictive.",5
Wait times if you play for free,3
Micro Transactions are bad mmmmkay,1
The game was amazing until updates were released. This has affected gameplay in a negative manner. You're capped at how much you can upgrade your mines but your dungeon heart level. There are now ridiculous build times. These updates took my favourite game and made me dislike to play it.,1
This is one of the best strategy games for people who like to be evil.,5
Enjoyable,5
Quite addictive,5
"I would give 5 stars if it didn't disconnect so often.  In the middle of a battle and it shuts down, and I lose all my warriors.",3
"Its kind of the same look, but not the same gameplay. They edited the vulgarity to accommodate all ages which is sad. It plays more like Clash of Clans than anything else, with the spin of kitty Dungeon Keeper. I spent $10 on it with a little regret. I'm a big fan of Dungeon keeper 1 and 2. This version makes me cry WHY!",2
"Addictive game might make you greedy and dictatorship, not a bad thing though !!!!",5
Very cool game,5
"This isn't even a game but a way to keep a fool from his money. When you''re not wasting your money on these ""precious"" gems, you are waiting for timers to disappear as you unlock stuff that gets wasted quicker than the timers go down! You''re better off playing something much more fun and not a waste of your time, like ""Brave Frontier"" Or ""Puzzle and Dragon"".",1
I love it,5
finally!!! Horny is back! love this app miss the pc version thanks for this version now i can play wherever i go!,5
In addition to being a huge money/time sink it won't even work properly. Disconnects during raids result in loss for yourself with disproportionate trophy losses. Annoying and a waste of time.,1
Cant get past the tutorial,1
Woo,5
This game is so fun,1
This was one of my favorite games on the PC.  This mobile app version is all about in app purchases.  I would rather pay for the previous version outright than be asked at every turn to spend money.  So disappointed.,1
How anyone could rate this thing 5 stars is mind boggling. Shameless cash grab obviously fueled by idiots with mommies credit card.,1
Not quite as good as the original 2 to me but still a fun game Like most games they are messing it up regularly,4
Fun!,4
Time killer,4
"This game is pretty fun and I really like it but at one point I deleted it because if you try to raid with vampires and ghosts it works a few times and then freezes everything and just says ""reconnecting"" . Fix it and I'll rate you higher!",3
How do you get past when you have to buy another imp in the tutorial,4
I get maybe 2-5 updates a day.. glitch in the system? For now this game is terrible...,1
Probably with less micro transactions please.,1
,5
It takes a while but it gets cool seeing the different rooms and traps upgraded,5
"Clasic game, same feal as the PC game from years back and that game was a blast as well.",5
Great way to waste some time,5
I like playing with friends and raiding.The guilds keep me company and the game is fun.,5
"Its now a detriment to have a well designed dungeon. You now WANT your dungeon heart to die as soon as possible when someone attacks, otherwise 3-4 people will have attacked you before you're ready to attack someone else; meaning it will be impossible to gain gold/stone",1
Never thought this game would be cool n I was dead wrong,5
THIS GAME IS AWESOME,5
Great,5
I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. This game played great for a few hours. Then displayed a code 1 patch error. Then the game did not reload and I could not restore Internet connection at all until I un installed the game. Quite a shame.... I was having fun.,1
Too bad you cant start restart your dungeon.  I would save my gems early and spend them wisely.  It has been very unstable with the recent update. I get disconnected in the middle of raids. Also the Back button stops working so the only way to exit the app is with the Home button.,2
More fun and in depth than clash of clans,5
"This app is just a simplified and reskinned ""Clash of Clans"". It had some potential, but there isn't much in the way of stratagy that can be done with dungeon design, and the constant begging for money gets old quickly.",2
"The overall game is fun,however I dont like the way you have to use real money to get a better experience so early in the game.",3
Very fun game it's a must get.,5
This game is just absolutely amzing and it's incredibly fun. Doesn't live up to previous games but still addictive and fun.,5
Great game!,4
So fun,5
Good game if you like clash of clans you'll like this,4
This is amaaaaaaaazing,4
Awesome,5
Fun like coc but with a different twist,3
"Mostly rsting to get it out of the way, might come back and change it later",3
I have no complaints its a pretty fun little game.,5
Fixed after closing Google link,5
"Can't install get an Error 919  Plz Plz Plz fix, it looks like a really good game",1
I love this game. I really can't get enough of this game. Its the perfect game to pass the time with.,5
Loads then says cannot connect to server... I was going to buy premium... Fix this developers,1
Really fun,5
Good game to play very fun.,5
Just wish upgrades didn't take so long and you got some more free gems and start with 3 imps,5
Nice,5
Def not lik the pc version but a decent time waster,3
Awesome,4
Fun game,5
This game is almost exactly like mighty quest for epic loot on the pc it is sooooooooooo fun to play I hope that their is much to come fore this game,5
Cool game addictive,4
For some reason while building dungeon I lose connectivity. (Asus Nexus 7) Loved this game back in the day but too spoiled by apps that actually work to tolerate the problems with simple game play: too long to load; too much to purchase for effective game play and too many issues with connection. Uninstalled.,1
Demented humor,4
Good game,5
"Lots of fun but the gems are way too expensive. Its a good 5-20 minutes of play in between the hours long building, room upgrade and space clearing times.",3
One of the greatest games in the play store,5
simplemente asombroso.,5
"Game keeps ""connecting to server"" no allowing for more than 5 minutes of play time, making this unplayable",1
"Real fun until you run out of gems, in app purchases to expensive for the minuscule amount of gems you get in return for your hard earned money.",3
Stops during tutorial,1
Cool game!!!!!,5
Awesome,5
Seems OK. Lots of annoying check back and harvest mechanic,4
"But get very frustrated when it crashes when I do a raid... stable every other time, but like half the time on a raid it crashes.",3
So awesome!,5
Excellent and fun! How can one do so much in so little of space? Get the app and find out! Guaranteed you'll like it or your money back!,5
This game is AWESOME!,5
"I have been looking for a game this good for about.... Forever now!!! Well, its finally here",5
Just like the game I played as a kid.,5
gg,5
"Just like clash of clans, but with more things to keep your eye on.",5
Show you how to play hard to play takes LOOOOOONG to load I DON'T LIKE IT!!!!!!! Deleting ... NOW,1
The app is good,5
What a wonderful game,5
"Well they seemed to fix a lot of the problems the game was having.  I play almost everyday it's a little addicting.  If you are new to the game or have been playing for a while and looking for a guild, I have a guild called ""Knights who say ni"" we are 40+ members strong and looking for active players also our guild is level 7 and working our way up at a pretty decent pace.",5
"This is a sad day when my all time favorite has been made into another crap dime a dozen game where if you want to do anything you have to pay for some kind of currency or item. I would rather pay the $5.50 and get the original with expansions  then play this which is actually what I'm going to do once I'm done writing this. If anyone is reading this and has a computer buy the original off of steam or gog and get, play and enjoy what the real deal is because its good to be evil.",1
,4
Great fun,5
Fun game but those with money have the advantage. I'm tired of spending money in every game just to hold my own.,4
Cool,5
Thank you for brining back to me my all time favorite game!!! I still play dk2 on my pc lol,5
Fun lots and lots of fun,5
Awesome,5
Every time i log in It freezes up. plz fix and ill play again,3
Really fun as a first time player. Cant put it down...ever!,5
Great job.  Love the game play and graphics.,5
Everything's unbearably slow its shameful to the original.,1
Its like the mighty quest for epic loot i like it,5
"Love the game, hate microtransactions.",5
Good game,5
Game is totally playable without in app purchases. Great fun,5
Fun to play,5
Keeps freezing down.load take for ever,1
It should not suck this bad,2
"It starts out very nice. You have lots of fun, but begin to wonder why some things give you gold slowly and why you have to click to actually get that gold. After 30 min playing, it becomes obvious. Everything can be sped up by spending money. Real life money. If this game wasn't a free-to-wait game, I would probably have paid a few bucks to play it without having to wait hours for everything.  And EA should be sued for only letting people who want to rate 5 stars reach Google Play to review from the app.",1
A different breed of build your own thoroughly enjoyable,4
It's original,5
"I have some ideas for EA, and have composed an email. Hopefully, my idea will stupend all of you and have it be not ambiguous.",4
"Unless you have piles of money to spend do not buy this game.It is absolutely NOT like the PC versions other than some names in common. EVERYTHING you do will take days to complete unless you pay really overpriced gems to speed it up. 24 hrs to dig 1 brick, 3 days to upgrade a room from lvl 6 to 7. Unless you pay  big money. Want more than 2 imps? ( which you need to do any task) PAY UP!  Want to keep other keepers from walking in and stealing all your resources?  PAY UP!  Here are some traps to build to keep enemies out...WORTHLESS. Spend lots of time reinforcing your walls....worthless. The game is so unbalanced that ANY keeper can destroy your dungeon and you can do the same at any time. Now understand I have played this game nonstop for over a month so I know the game. I spent quite a bit of money so I'm not just cheap. It just comes down to play for 5 min to wait hours( minimum) to accomplish anything that doesn't actually accomplish anything.    So there's my long winded angry at EA for ruining one of my favorite games review.  Trust me..don't bother.",1
Nice time waster. Can't wait to start guild with my son!,5
Great game,5
Way better than clash it has every thing good but way better,5
Good game,5
Fun game to play and strategies with friends over.,5
The phone sucks the PC one was better you should make the phone one like the PC one,1
Addicting,5
Great layout and design. Fun and rather addicting.,5
I have just started playing and im loving every second of it,5
Gg,5
Great game fun got a clash of the clans feel,5
Amazing!!!! I played the original ones released for pc and this is just as fun. Great adaptation for mobile even the humor is keeping of the same style.,5
"Loved playing this game when I was a kid in the pc, and it is still as enjoyable on the mobile as it was one the pc!",5
Easy fun and quick,4
fun game good graphics but still need to put a little bit of money into it at first to get it going,4
Amazing,5
Awesome,5
Very fun,5
I really hate the way that ea took a great game and turned it into a piece of crap. Unless they make some serious changes soon I'm uninstalling it and I will never play an ea game again ¬ª:-(,2
Great game!,5
So far its fun. Let's see what happens in later stages,4
Really fun,4
Plated the pc version for countless hours and lived it. I don't like how the game has so many micro transaction options but it's a pocket game and what I have come to expect.,5
Better than clash of clans and much cooler.,5
I like it a lot. Played something similar in pc. Both are hella fun,4
Stuck at 100% and it won't download,1
Wont pull up the keyboard to name my dungeon in the tutorial.  Can't do anything.,1
Saw a ad on YouTube and gave it a shot and now I'm addicted,5
This game is amazing for tower defense lovers and comedy lovers looking for a good laugh!,5
Love this game,5
I love it very fun,5
Love DA dungeon keepa,5
The greed that spews forth from EA is truly sickening!,1
So far I enjoy it. Might prove deep and exciting.,4
I got bored with coc but I can't get bored with this,5
love it.,5
Good game LG L9 plays well on it. Fun not the original but fun.,3
"Good game. But when I heard the rap, I thought, this has to be Dan bull. I went on YouTube , looked it up, and I found it. I think you should give Dan bull some credit at least though.",4
I keep havimg to restart all over again. Please fix.,1
I like it,5
Addicted,5
Fun for people that like to build,5
This game is batter than clash of clans!!!,5
Very fun game!,5
Cool I like it I just think that they should read to u,5
This game feel much better on android than iOS. No crash.,5
Awesome,4
Easy and fun,5
Fun and addictive game,5
Dd,5
A little expensive for the gems but fun game,5
Fun,5
"I can see it getting boring soon but I've been wrong b4. The first several levels, I've really enjoyed and am still engaged. The graphics and are really well done too. Also haven't had to spend a penny yet either.",5
I cant get past it because the words dont finish when i need to summon the imp please help.,3
Great game good for passing time,4
I guess its okay. A little slow but still pretty good.,3
Amazing 5 thumbs up,5
Finger gets stuck during tutorial for summoning minion.  Fix this and I'll really rate you.,1
This game is really good you really should get it it may take time but ITS FUN,4
Excellent game and a lot better then I thought,5
Goood voice actor,5
"Fun game, but I would like to be able to turn the sound off and change the notification settings.  Am I missing something or does this game not have settings that can be changed?",3
Overall it reach a good balance after many updates... I enjoy graphics and ganeplay. Very addictive,4
If you got $ fun game,4
if u like playing tower defense type of games then this game should be one of them on the list of must play..definitely recommend..,5
Im still tryib to get the hang of it but honestly its better then it feels.,4
Awesome game really fun,5
Bow down bwitches,5
U need to pay money to get the most but everything can be done with zero cash spent it just takes lots of time.   Recently though there is bad connection problems which can cost u when u are invading other realms or doing the event. If this happens u lose ur progress or gold. Fix this plz!!!,4
Do not buy this game it is made as a easy way for EA to get money you can only play the game a week with out buying 50 $ worth of $#!/ I repeat do not but this game,1
"If you liked the old Dungeon Keeper games and are looking for the same style this probably isn't the game for you (give it a shot you might just like it, wasn't what I was expecting but I still enjoy).  If you don't plan to spend money, then you can expect to wait to accomplish your tasks just as you would in any similar game (Evony, Caesary, Galaxy Online are a few that come to mind).  With that out of the way I would really like to say that the people complaining about having to spend money to enjoy this game either have no patience or nothing else to do.  There are lots of achievements to complete, hilarious punny narrations, an unfinished campaign mode, evolving gameplay, and PvP.  Don't let whiners talk you out of trying this game, at the same time don't expect to ""win"" if you don't spend money as  there are in app purchases that speed the game up and give a competitive edge that free players such as myself do not have access to (EA is money hungry though).  Bottom line I have fun playing this game.",4
B,5
"A poorly done, monetized treatment of a once great game.",1
Really cool game ‚ë© ;-),5
Dk wow can't remember when I last played this...hope to see if it comes to pc again,4
Awesome,5
So far I've only done one raid. When I saw the minions taking 23 hours to dig up jems however I started to sweat. The term free to play pay to win is a real kick in the crotch. Nevertheless I hope to revisit a game I barely played before on a friends computer when I was young but I fell in love with it instantly.,4
so far so good i like it,4
Fun game,5
Is great graphics are good and you start with enough rubies so it a real good game,4
Awsome,5
This game is fun and all but It really reminds me a similar game to this and I didn't like it,4
Pretty cool,5
Fun,5
Mwahahahahahahahaha,4
"Once you play for a while, the  game allows way down.  There is no reason to even open the game for days at a time.",3
Good game.,5
Cool game,4
"Would be 5 stars if resources were easier to click on, too often I end up selecting the wrong thing.  More imps without cash would be nice too.",4
This is like a more controlled clash of clans,5
This game is ridiculous. Its so addicting,5
Star rating.... enough said.,5
Great game. Love it. Don't love the fact it isn't available on Galaxy tab 7 3.0,3
"I have to say, slapping the imps is the most satisfying part. However, game play is smooth, base design is fun and different than your usual stick crap where ever you want. Money system is well balanced.",4
Yup,5
"Good game, fun but challenging.",5
Great game very good time consumer,5
"The media attention this game has had is unfortunate.  The rating scandal is inexcusable, but the pay2win accusation is ridiculous. A small amount of money helps, maybe 2-3 extra imps, but beyond that is totally superfluous.  Just a really good game with some excellent balance.  You need to think, analyze your defense playbacks and participate in the player fight to get into the game.  Not for the care bear hearted.  REVISED AFTER PLAYING FOR SOME TIME  This game is extremely buggy and unstable and the developers put out completely unpolished builds with little testing and slow turn around on fixes.  It would be one thing if everything didn't have some currency solution in place, but basically all of these bugs end up essentially costing you money.  Examples:  - Game has lost connection multiple time during raids, which cost premium currency to participate in.  Submitting a support ticket granted nothing. - During a previous build of the game, for several weeks, imps would do effectively nothing while bugging out until one imp would finish resetting the build queue.  I purchased these imps with gems, and they were effectively made useless by this bug for weeks.",2
"Well, this was certainly good at first. Emphasis on ""at first"". The graphics were really good, but the ridiculously long wait times were a major blow to my opinion. Also, I didn't know this at first, but EA actually insulted the original devs (Bullfrog Studios) by using their logo for a destroyed building! As if that's not bad enough, the mechanics are completely different from the original game, making it into an outright Clash of Clans ripoff. I had much better expectations than EA filled after reading Dungeon Keeper's TVTropes page. I am fully expecting a revamp in the future that fixes all these problems. Or a sequel that is closer to Original!Dungeon Keeper.",2

'Nuff said,5
Not quite as elaborate as th old pc version but it does bring back some good memories. Bwa ha ha.,2
,5
This game is very awesome,5
Just started but its pretty cool. I love what the game host has to say! So campy! THE LOADING TIME IS SO LONG! PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!,3
"U need to keep paying to play, those that pay will still be better then u...",1
,4
"It's a Wonderful time killer I suggest the download very fun... ""I don't like that it ask for money to much""",5
"But where are the ""heroes,"" that was the best part of the franchise.",5
Fun 'till it was free to play and pay to win...,1
Just bad,1
A must have to kill time while you get a good laugh in,5
Only problem I have with the game is that it takes a long time to build up gems. That is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. Love it almost as much as the computer version it is based on.,4
Have to upgrade heart to level 6.... gold storage limit not enough to pay for it... cant increase gold storage until i get to 6...... ideas... anyone else?,3
Love it!,5
Real fun just wished you had more imps to start with.,5
Have not stop playing this,5
Game EVER,5
,4
Fun times,5
Awesome game,5
Good game,5
Would give give if there was a possibility of caving in/ abandoning unwanted mines,4
Fun keeps you entertained,4
24 hrs to break one block or you can pay 1.50 for the gems to make it take 6 sec.,2
"Great graphics, fun to play, ""Horny"" is funny and amusing...highly recommend this game.",5
Great time killer! Love the game!,5
If you really put your heart into building a dungeon it wont matter. Players with levelled up bomb wall will destroy it in seconds and swarm your wide open dungeon with trolls.,1
"More protection but a few bugs came out with the last patch. Like when i try to unlock a new imp but there's no option to do so or the boost efficiency countdown not being there anymore, among other issues.",2
,5
I refuse to play this game until it's fixed. It keeps kicking me out even if i dint pass anything. It's annoying and I actually play this game. Fix it and ill change my review. Bad update!!!,2
,5
This game is so great in the beginning. PVP is awesome. It's gorgeous and easy to play. The higher you get the longer it takes to do ANYTHING AT ALL. This is so you will buy gems. 2 to 4 days a job with only a few workers to do it. Even small things take 8-12 hours.  They really ruined a great idea.,2
Awesomeness,5
,5
Old skool re amped,5
I love the game kind of similar to clash of clans and like clash you'll be tempted to spend real money.,5
,5
Very fun and addictive,5
Takes a long time to collect resources and game connection stutters at times.,4
"Wow. Unbelievable! No wonder EA is up for worst company in America for the third year running. This is a mobile game that should cost no more than $10, but instead is the most disgusting pay to play title ever released. Way to go EA! It costs $99.99 for 14,000 gems that you can literally burn through in less than an hour, and you would still not even come close to maxing out your buildings or mining the entire map. Absolutely shameful! Seriously, $50 for the last Imp? Is someone at EA smoking crack?",1
Very fun!,5
Don't mind that it's freemium. It cracks me up!! And great gameplay,5
Great game:-),4
"Finally they came out with a new dk, I own both for computer and I love them however it's a little hard to put cheats codes into this version of the game. I still love it. Play so far is Awesome. However I like the previous horney. This one looks kind of weak.",5
"It's a fun game that doesn't take too much time out of my day. Pretty buggy though, but getting better.",4
"Everything about this game is amazing. Haven't seen any bugs, no glitches. Gets 5 stars from me",4
"I can very rarely raid, with the newest update, cause It loses connection most of the time when I try. When I am able to finally raid someone, of loses connection right after I deploy my troops, causing me to lose them all and get nothing in return.",3
,1
I like it,5
"Back from the Bullfrog days. Same idea, new style. I love it. Fast paced, or slow, it's up to you. Slap an imp, it feels so right... again.",5
Great game remake.  Reminds me of when I was a kid,3
Fun,4
Love the old school DK style but hate the long time to farm for imps and gems ~!,4
I'm in love with this game,5
Loving it so far,5
"This game would be great,  but it's impossible to get anywhere without paying for it. Ruins an otherwise great experience.",3
"Not a game you spend hours on.  Instead you check in occasionally; start building structures, maybe raid a dungeon then come back again later. Overall a good time. Dint worry so much about your layout because you can modify it later as you figure out the game.",4
I disconnect in the middle of battles. This is very bad as i lose troops and magic for nothing.  It had now been happening on and off for more than a week. I am about to remove the game. I have not been able to complete a raid in over two days.  Fix your game or give my money back,1
Not bad for a free game not quite like the pc version but passes the time,4
Pretty sweet,5
Game is a total rip off if your dont spend real money on gems. You will be beat down by the players who do. With all the updates a non paying custumer will lose more than you can collect. So dont waste your time or money. EA loves to take your cash and in return give you a nothing but a unblanced and unfair game. Go find a copy of the real Dk great old game and it won't cost you a weeks pay either. Dont play this game unless you want to spend 60 bucks a week,1
"A lot of people will say this game is horrible because you have to buy gems to do anything. This is far from the truth, I'm sure EA did the gem system to make money but really it forces you to play strategically, by  creating an environment where you have to choose what to upgrade, or dig out in order to build your dungeon. I think the people who complain about the length of time it takes to do things are people who are to use the instant gratification most games provide. This is a great game. Try it.",5
I used to play the pc version.  And that game was amazing and addictive,5
Total time sink of fun,5
"It's my newest little addiction I wish it was closer to the sandbox I remember, but it keeps the humor.",5
Great game that keeps getting better. Takes me back to the hours spent playing the pc game. I would like to see a stand alone version though like the original where you're only playing against yourself,5
Just stick with the originals. EA seems to be royally screwing gamers out of their money as of late.,1
"In EA's endless effort to ruin classics and make games unenjoyable the DRM-like requirement to always be connected means you not only need to be still while playing but if EA servers aren't responding you can be at full bars and can't play. Gameplay functions aren't well thought out, guild features are non existent, and lots of memory intensive updates that change the game mechanics not always for better",1
Love this app!  Would give it 5 stars if there was an easier/cheaper way to get gems.,4
I like the game but it just isn't my interest right now. Nothing against you guys or anything.,5
The wall update broke it. It is fully designed now to suck all your money. It was fun but I am not paying anymore. Uninstalled.,1
Very addictive being the bad guy.,4
Really fun game just play it a bit and the more you play tbe more atuff you can do and the game will be real smooth after that,5
I like it....good time waster,5
Fun,5
Super fun,5
From. Bradley Scudder.,5
Love this game,5
Why do you have to update every two days with the 47 megabytes of data. This game has nothing on clash I give it a try for a month uninstalled,1
As soon as I was promted to buy another imp game freezes up. Seems like it would be a fun game if I could actually play. Fix this issue and I'll have more stars I'm sure of it.,1
Cool,5
Reinstalled 2 times and still doesnt work loads up to 90% then crashes please fix. After update still doesnt work. Code 7 and when I retry just crashes,3
"Every time you play this game. Get attacked and are starting to raid back? Reconnecting... Raid and waste all you units to almost win. Reconnecting... Dumb game, no clue why I thought it was worth spending money in. Regret now.",1
Like the original,3
options to buy are well placed and appropriate...,5
"Has an original Diablo feel but with great graphics and a crude devilish guide. I would've given 5 stars but the ""wait for completion"" stage has come quicker than typically.",4
"Too slow, in game rating prompt prevents anything but 5 stars. Another great IP ruined by EA greed and a lack of any real progression.",3
Not worth the download time,2
"Dungeon Keeper meets Tower Defense, Enough said. A Must Play, And if you are playing join my guild, The Imp Labor Union, All are welcome to join. But i must ask EA to make an update, The game really needs a Rally Spell, So you can direct your minions to converge on a location to defend your dungeon much better.",5
And money HUNGRY,3
About 5 days ago I added ten dollars to purchase 1200 gems my money went threw and was taken but I have yet to receive the gems and every time I click on 1200 gems nothing happens..can I please get my gems and maybe something for this inconvenience? ?  Sincerely  Shaun McCormick,1
So much fun.  Right now I'm clearing my way to the outside gold and stone mines so I'm getting to play this game for about 5 seconds every day.   Here is a full 24 hours of my gameplay in a nutshell  Log in Click on a new block to clear out Shut off the game  That's it. What an amazing game! I'll never pour money into these stupid games and if you do you're an idiot. Plain and simple.,1
"Look it's free to play dungeon keeper, I expect all the add on stuff. Add on stuff is fine. What I can't abide by is on my Galaxy S3 I am CONSTANTLY reconnecting. I have lost tons of the paid for resource (gems) because of this. Also the misses some very basic functionality. Why can't I store rooms and items while I work on a new layout? You can't delete rooms you find useless after you build it (looking at you Guildhall.) So no I will not recommend this game.",2
Looking forward to playing this for a while.,4
"I love that someone has brought this game back to life. I played the original computer game years ago and loved it then. I miss some of the options from the original, but the mobile version still kicks @$$!",4
I really enjoy playing this game but some of the waits are slightly ridiculous...,4
,4
"Anything and everything I can possibly critique has already been stated by other users. Poor balancing, pay2win model, awful updates, unrealistic time frames for upgrades/excavation, etc... It's virtually impossible,  without spending money, to maintain steady raiding for an extended period of time.  All in all, this is a game that demands little attention, rewards users with little satisfaction, and as per EA standards, requires a thick wallet. Pass this and move on.",1
"Seriously, this game is so ridiculously expensive or unplayable its not even worth my time, i dont mind a few dollars or whatever. EA stop being greedy, it encourages piracy.   The game is fun, so i give it a star for that",2
"i liked the original, and now i love this one. been waiting for something like this  for awhile.",5
"It's so sad to see the Dungeon keeper IP used this way. Despite what the pictures show, you get 2 imps unless your willing to spend 800 gems in-game, however the packs are $5 for 500, $8 for 900, $10 for 1200, $20 for 2500, ¬£50 for 6500, $100 for 14000. On top of that the 2x efficiency boost only lasts 30 mins not 8 hours, maybe that goes up as you buy more imps...   Had to write this review on google play as if you try to give it less than 5 stars when it asks in the app it will only give the option to submit feedback to the devs.",2
Not as good as the original but addictive on its own.,5
It's just too easy,4
"Fun game but good luck getting a third imp or an immortal without shelling out $20-$50. You can't even control where your minions go! Sometimes they can run the wrong directions and get slaughtered! Also, my game kicking me out between loading stages. If I attempt to attack a dungeon and the enemy has a cave in in place, it sends me to my home screen of my phone and not my dungeon. Every 4 mins or so of game play, the game freezes and restarts my phone. What's going on? Fix this please!!",2
Constant pop ups to tease you into spending money to buy in game items.,4
Huge fan of the original two by bullfrog. This one does not even compare. May have same awesome characters but did not stay true to the original.,2
Really great game I reccomend to anyone,5
Love it,4
Simple tutorial and UI. Fun and easy. Works well on my Galaxy S3.,4
Very cool graphics and game play.,5
Somehow my phone spent all my gems on gold and stone I just need these transactions reversed please. Just lost 1600 gems,1
Speechless!!!!!!!!!!!,5
,5
Worth a try,5
Im new I love it,5

"For old fans of the Dungeon Keeper series this version is still not enough. The dependency on gems is very high and for free players they're very hard to come by.  Also, the time to do some tasks like digging is way too long, which really impact those who enjoy the building your dungeon experience.",3
Awsome game,5
,4
"Had this game on my PC years ago and it was one of my favorites. Was really looking forward to playing it again and would have paid $10 for it, but instead, EA has to rape it's customers for every last penny. Seriously... $99 for an in-app purchase? Theives!  **The latest update (there is at least one a day if not more), cuts down the amount of gems you get after mining for an entire day. You used to get between 20-30, but now you're lucky if you get 5. This makes the game unplayable without purchasing them",1
"Similar graphics and game play, but... * MANY missing features.  * everything cost too much * takes too long to build * cant delete anything * very slow to load Worth a download for free, but the issues pile up,  quickly getting old fast. :(",3
But I feel like its missing something I don't know yet but I will tell you when I found it,4
,1

Can not make a dungeon name.  No keyboard will come up.  Unable to play game.  Device samsung note 8,1
,5
Fun game,5
,4
"A little patience goes a long way in this game. Yes, you might have to wait awhile to mine the hard stone, and it'll take nearly a week to build some structures. You can cut base time in half by slapping your imps around. For twenty bucks you can get two additional imps and some gems to grow on, and shouldn't ever have to purchase anything again unless you've just got to build something right this instant. This game is the best of the Freemiums, with actual strategy in how you deploy and what you level up.",5
,5
Finally can play again Thanks for the fix,5
Like old days,5
"I have always enjoy Dugeon Keeper from back in the day, and now it's back! Ah, the nostalgia is overwhelming...",4
,5
"A little money heavy, but not bad to start.",4
Highly recommended for you to play,5
"Event raids suffer from such poor implementation that they need to have the game cheat against the player. They neutered the bleak humor of the original.   They destroyed the game balance,  and put very long dig times that destroy the pace. Add in the 800 gem insult to buy a 3rd imp and the result is a steaming pile of game that should forever be a black mark against the utterly incompetent development team.",1
"Since the last update, I am unable to attack at all. Constantly says ""reconnecting"".  Spend more time loading than anything else.",1
I played for about 10 mins the whole time the game demanding I use gems to speed up 15 second timers.  Then when it finally let's me play myself everything takes over TWENTY FOUR HOURS? To complete?  And you have the balls to ask for real money from me?  Screw you EA you are really deserving of the title worst company in the world 2 years (and I bet 3 and more!) Running  Avoid this game at all costs,1
I typically won't give 5 star ratings unless it's an absolute mind blowing game... dungeon keeper comes pretty close though. I just gave it 4 stars due to the number of notifications it creates.,4
,4
Amazing game! Easy to figure out and fun to play Just wish gems were easier to find... but other then that this game is great for everyone!,5
,4
Fun and funny for the kids,5
,5
so far its my favorite game available on any mobile device  ..you play it you feel accomplished when you earn new things..,5
Lately been hanging and disconnecting annoyingly often. Otherwise reasonably fun if you're willing to make the time and or money investment.,2
"Great game, easy to use, fun to play",5
Just started playing so we will see,5
,3
Way to long for resources and to expensive for new imps.  And thanks for making reinforced walls suck now. Even more of a reason to waste more resources and for you guys to make more money.,1
Games that let you be attacked when you're off-line,1
"Every time I attack someone, it reconnects and stops in the middle of whatever I'm doing, making attacking pointless, which is the entire premise of the game. Needs some work to get a better rating",5
,5
Worked awesomely on lg gpad.,5
"I've been playing this game for a few weeks now. The concept is great the graphics and characters are fun, but It is soooooo slow and really not fun at all. Maybe it's just because I refuse to spend money on gems, but all I do is wait. Lame.",1
,4
"Great tactical game, only downside is the wait time",5
While the game is fun it can be challenging to actually progress though the game. It would be helpful if there was a dungeon planner of some kind.  I also wish there was a way to reset your dungeon but keep you gem purchases.,2
Bummer,2
Okay waste of time,4
The latest update broke this game. It crashes while connecting on my Nexus devices.,1
"I still actively play the PC DK & DK2, these are NOTHING like either short of naming mobs the same. It's an uber boring cash grab & not much else.",1
They wont give me my free imp or the gems I payed for we all already knew ea sports is a bunch of crap its been two days and they wont even contact me,1
,5
Addictively fun even without succumbing to the Gems microtransactions.(EA would have your soul as well if they could.).  I see progressive improvement with each update.  Better minion inventory/micromanagement tools would enhance this game greatly.  Fingers are crossed.,4
I really like this game. However every since I did the last update it won't load the game. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but no luck. If I can't play it why keep it. If I should try something else please let me know.,2
,4
I don't like the waiting but once I'm playing it's very fun!,5
Passes the time!,5
,5
Fun addictive only drawback is the gem cost for imps,5
Pretty good so far,5
Game keeps jamming in the beginning intro when it tells you buy a second imp. The written text is glitched and you cant tap on anything. Very frustrating cuz this was a favorite game of mine back in the day.,1
It would get a much higher score if it weren't for the  micro transactions,3
"Easy,fun,doesn't ask to pay for things to stay competitive",5
Need people to join the guild Animosity,4
As addicting as the first,5
,4
Stll won't play on my phone. Really wish this would get fixed.,1
I'm going to give it 5 stars for now. I like the self upgrade on the spells.,5
Taking 24 hours to dig out one block is to long,1
,4
Minions are cool,5
Great game!,5
,1
My favorite game on Android until Hearthstone comes out.,5
The new update made it so that whatever defense u had against the bomb spell no longer exists and there is still no world chat... that is why this game has gone down in my opinion.,3
"The graphics are so similar to Clash of Clans, and the whole game structure to boot. The main difference (besides a few sprite changes) is COC does not pester you to buy gems constantly. The tutorial instructs users to use gems liberally, trying to create a habit which requires expensive purchases to maintain. Great for a cash-cow app owner, bad for players. Not surprising for EA, who hasn't put quality first in gaming for nearly 20 years.",1
,5
"I love Dungeon Keeper, but would have prefered a one time purchase.  Maybe it is just nostalgia talking and I should quit rattling my cane one my rocking chair and telling ""free-to-play"" to get off my lawn, because it is here to stay.  It is a huge consolation, however, that I do not feel like I am crushed by players who spend there way to dominance.",4
"Love this game, one I keep going back to",5
,5
App kept asking me for list of people in my google plus circles. Timers on everything. Fun game otherwise. But I am sick of intrusive games that take personal information. I'd rather buy the game. Greedy company that should not be rewarded.,1
"Its a great game, nice game play, fun premise, and good writing.  All and all a good game.",4
Wish it wasn't casual but whatever...,3
Good game,5
Addictive,5
Great game so far! One really annoying bug is with the win rating on raids. Recently had an attacker take me on and finish at 36% of a win...after the raid was done he was bumped up to a 51% win rating.  Needs a little refining.,4
,4
"Love Dungeon Keeper, but this game could be more balanced on all aspects. Plus I've bought gems and never received them, sent in emails trying to get it figured out and have heard nothing from EA/Mythic. Not very promising.",3
"As many have noted, this game is just another building game. Very similar to Clash of Clans. They could have done so much more to resemble the old PC game, which would have been unique and fun.   It's an average building game that takes much too long to build resources. Update - latest update made multiple items worth less. Such as the reinforced wall (which is now just a wall that takes damage) and the boost for slapping your imps has been reduced.",1
"Great graphics, pretty good game play. I prefer the original PC game though",5
,4
No brainer keepers,5
,4
Enjoy this game over others similar.,5
This game is a fun take on dungeon theme games. I like it a lot,5
"Easy to play, simple concept. Can eat up an hour or so playing, but easy tomput down when needed.",3
Fun game,5
The art's a little different but this good to see someone putting effort to make sure it is not forgotten,5
Not sure what else to say. Its a cute little app and quite fun to boot.,5
Good game but it doesn't stay connected.,2
"I used to play DK as a kid and was excited to see it in the play store, although the game has to keep trying to reconnect to the serve. But still pretty cool",5
"Just a great experience, from characters to graphics to sound... Fun for hours, I can't stop playing.",5
"The game was already a big fail because of those stupid ingame purchases.  And now, with the new update to the reinforced walls and bomb spell, it is now impossible to  defend your dungeon correctly!!  Nerf the bomb spell or boosts the reinforced walls, but dont leave it at that!!!  It is retarded!",1
Love to play it,5
"Only draw back is there is no ""planner"" so you have to make extra space to move things.",5
Great game but it has serious connection problems! Even when your with full bars or wifi it won't connect sometimes.,3
Pay-to-play scam,1
Love this game,5
"I would have paid $10 for the original game ported over. I would even entertain $1 upgrades had they been reasonable. 4 hours to remove one square, are you kidding me. EA has ruined this game and should be ashamed.",1
Fun at first but slows down rather fast. Need to buy more imps with real money. Overly repetitive. Clash of clans is much better over all. Uninstalled after I reinstalled a couple days ago to see where I was at. EA fails at life any more really.,1
,5
Nothing like the real game.,1
Love the graphics not sow boring as I thought,5
"I had played the original years ago and this version does have the same feel to it.  The gameplay has been updated, and the flow of play has been slowed, but overall I think it is very fun and worth of the time to play.",5
I bought gems for the first time payment went though then the game would never let me back in.  That's a lil sketchy,4
Love it,5
Numerous bugs hinder gameplay. Some fun battles and if you are extremely patient it is an ok game. Not even close to being as good of a game as the original. Very disappointing to see what ea had done to ruin yet another franchise.,2
The most fun I've had in a while,5
Great Almost !like the old dungeon keeper üòÇüòÇ,5
"This game is an utter joke.   For the amount you'd have to pay to play this game, you can purchase it for pc a hundred times over.   Anyone that spends money in this game is an utter retard and I pity you.   Uninstall and pass on this game!  Don't get scammed!!!!",1
If your just looking for a game you can fire up for a few minutes every couple of hours you'll like it. If you want a game you can actually play for hours keep looking. Build times become 4+ days dig times max out at 24 hours. Game would have been much better if they just charged 9.99 and got ride of the ridicules build and dig times.,2
It is a fun game and I have had no bugs or problems with it.,4
,3
.....gg,5
Almost like dungeon keeper!,4
But be careful I bought a gem pack during the special and haven't received the gems for it,4
Just downloaded it like it so far really hope it stays that way.,4
Seems fun need a little more time to figure it out,4
,4
Loved original from 90' so this is nostalgic. Although gameplay is not the same it is still rather fun game.,4
But every time someone attacks me I'm unable to retaliate,4
Awesome and addictive,5
,4
,5
Ok app . Worth downloading if you like these type of games.,2
I'm having fun.,4
Great playability but I think it could be more in depth with bigger dungeons and more characters,4
Money hungry corporate greed that is destroying video games,1
,5
Easy to earn stuff not much of a Challenge but fun,4
Loved the old PC game and I realy enjoy this mobile version.,5
The need for IAP gem purchases or waiting 5 days to upgrade something ruin the fun.,1
,4
"This app is hilarious and fun, I'm glad I downloaded it",5
"Wish it wasn't freemiun, oh well!",4
Reminds me of the classic.,5
I was a huge fan of the original. Really happy that they kept what was good about it.,3
Addicting and fun,5
,5
"Extremely disappointed in this game. Clever gameplay, was having a blast and it forced me to update. Oncethe update was installed, the game started force stopping and then my game started completely over. Now, I cant even continue. It keeps stzrting over. What a letdown. Developers need to stop focusing on stupid, useless crap like ringtones and improve the game...",1
"Once you mine/earn enough gems to get three imps, it's not horrible. Don't spend gems on speeding things up. Save them to purchase imps.",3
Love it so much fun,5
Locks up all the time,3
,5
So cool and exciting,5
One of my favorite PC games. Love it.,5
"I remember this game from bullfrog. What the hell EA? You ruined plants v zombies and now Dungeon Keeper with your micro transactions. This game spent less than 5 minutes on my phone before deleting it. I remember when EA used to make good games what the heck happened? Update: the game actually isn't this app that's downloaded but the trainwreck from the business at mythic / skalski, and EA.",1
Too many problems to list in the end game.,1
,5
Paid for some extra gems to keep things moving. Problem is they reduced the items I built with the resources I purchased to worthless... Effectively STEALING my cash.,1
Just bought my first gem pack so I could get the free imp.  No gems and no imp.  WTH?!?!?,3
"...but updates have changed the mechanics to the point that it is unreasonable. For example,  ""Reinforced walls"" were changed such that they are no longer any different from regular walls, which defeats the entire purpose of having them.",2
Clicked on support link and it only took me to my Google wallet with no options.  Where is the support?,1
What's better then controlling everything while destroying others.,5
Thanks,5
,4
Cool games recommended for all those who want to destroy gangs some treasure,5
Blegh,1
You better have a full battery when you install this. You won't put your device down,4
I love to create dungeons for my DM challenges for players and this game helps me mold new ideas and new lvs of experience for my player's. Great all around fun for everyone.,5
,3
,5
Really cool game lol,5
Makes me miss the original.,5
"Good concept, fun to slap the minions around.",5
Excelamundo,5
"Fun game.  I miss some of the dungeon design feel of the original and, of course, gems are very slow in coming to encourage you to spend money, but over all, well done",5
"If my net access cuts out for just a minute, this game will hang. The game is alright. Clash of clans game with a dungeon theme. Controls are a bit finicky. Presses do not register properly at times. I enabled show finger presses and I was accurate. There are bugs and I have the replays to prove it.  23% of my dungeon was destroyed. The Dungeon Heart was still intact. Counted as a defeat.  Constant raising of the prices of ingame objects is a dirty tactic to try to get people to pay more cash. Do not pay money for this. As you progress, the build time for an army and mana increases.  You will have to perpetually shell out cash to play and you will have to pay even more as you level up.  Their ""best value"" package is $99.  I thought that was extremely unrealistic and who would go through that many gems.?  Believe me, in higher levels, it's realistic.",1
I had three imps before this update now I only have two! Plz fix ASAP,1
"It takes some getting used to, but has really good audio. The ""narrator's"" voice is really cool.",4
It's very good in the sense that it doesn't waste your time during raids and the graphics are really nice. Imps are a bit pricey but i guess that's to be expected.,5
Ok,5
"Not exactly like the original, but a lot of fun to play.  The problem is that I purchased in game items (gems that come with a bonus imp).  My credit card was charged, but the items never appeared. Tried to complain to EA about it, but I had to make an account just to post a message. Reading through the faq's, I seen a bunch of complaints about the same issue. Their response gives directions to open an in game complaint from the game menu. But the keyboard doesn't appear making this impossible.",1
,5
Having fun..graphics are nice..,4
Make imps faster an cheaper,3
The best game I've ever played in my life,5
A nice tablet version of a classic.  Built on the microtransaction model but that is the price we pay to not pay. Haha,4
,5
This game had potential but quickly requires money to get anywhere fast. Good graphics but the game play gets bogged down by the f2p model.,1
I doubt the developers ever played the original.,1
A very amusing game. The wait times are long yet not unrealistic. I love this game!,5
Only wish you could earn gems faster.,4
The best game i have ever played!!!,4
I would probably give 4 or 5 stars if it was not for the annoying updates that happen almost every other time I open up the game. 40mb 3 to 4 times a day? Good lord people. There is no updates that are of such importance!,3
"Game starts to find a new home for the keeper, then just goes back to ""connecting"" screen. I'm sitting beside the router. I'll go back to old PC version thanks.",1
,5
Can be expensive if you want to develope your dungeon quickly. But lots of fun.,5
,5
"A perfect example of how in app purchases ruined a good game. You can go buy the original version, the complete experience, for 10 dollars. Say no to this monstrosity.",1
,5
"This game is great,and they make it so you don't really have to spend a lot of money if you don't want to",5
Horrible sever issues  constantly restarting ... Lost many battles due to this issue ..,2
Why does the app now want permission to change my system settings?  Uninstalling.,1
Edit: problems were fixed in previous update. Love this game.  I often can't see what my imps are doing until they are done which is very annoying. Otherwise great game.,5
"Kinda buggy, and I paid for gems that I never recieved. No option to ask admin for assistance either",1
I played for a month with very few issues.  Now I am often unable to open the game and if I do manage to get in I can only play for 60 seconds before it freezes.  It is now officially a complete waste of time.  EA did a great job ruining a fine game.,2
,4
Game works fine now,4
"I really liked this game before, still kind of do. Making the walls upgradable was a horrible decision on the developers part. In game purchases (gems) are too costly. This is a fun game but not worth spending your money on.",3
I really liked the game until the last update.  Now it freezes my phone (galaxy 3S)  for several minutes 80 percent of the time I launch the game.  Would have been 4 or 5 stars until last update made the game pretty much unplayable.,1
,5
Like the game very much,5
I've always loved those old dungeon keeper pc games. Once this app got released I just had to get it and LOVED IT!,5
This game is worse then the beggers on a street corner always begging for money.,1
,5
This is nothing more than a farming game themed as Dungeon Keeper. It's heavily designed to leach in-app payments. This game really is a criminal abuse of a once fantastic franchise.,1
Twisted,4
"The in game purchase is essential to continue to plan. Gem is too expensive.  Update: With March 11 update, the game play becomes extremely unbalanced. It becomes childish hit&run with little stretagy and planning. No more undistructable wall. Ramming is your best option. No need to mining resource. Just spend a little gold you can easily get 50-100+k stone in 2 min. Gold becomes useless and always full in storage. For a 5 year old, maybe. For me, deleting ......",1
Yep.  Go Bullfrog.,5
"Now reinforced wall cannot stand a single spell blow. What is the point to have these 'reinforced'? This single change makes it even more unbalanced in favor of offense. It becomes a truely hit and run game.   No point of mining. Just hit someone. It is far more easier.   No need to build defense as it is useless and crumble easily. Only offense requires a gram of brain. Spend some $$$, you can ram around with very little skill or stretagy involved.   Deleting. It is a $$$$$ class 'free' game.",1
Ok,4
way fun different from any clash of clans or what ever,5
"From ok fun,  to bad,  to worse,  idk how i should feel about this one now,  some of the mechanics got changed,  nerfed others,  in the end makes it harder to play without paying for gems,  which now seems like you can hardly get any from mining the gem rocks.  But EA dont care cause people out there will always be willing to shell out money.  Seriously wish i could actually finish a raid though that would be nice Also all those 5 star ratings are probably from its automated rate me popup ingame",1
So now the dig spell can go through reinforced walls??? WTF!! No way u can make a good dungeon now keeper,1
,4
Nice,5
Takes too long to get things done unless I pay otherwise it would be five stars.,4
My new favorite game,5
They basically took the characters and stuck them on a in app purchase platform. They totally mutilated the dungeon keeper we all know and love be ready to wait.A LOT!!!,2
,5
,5
,4
GREAT GAME  .,5
Game would be 5 star if not for the fact that you have to buy gems to make it properly playable. EA took a great game and completely ruined it.,1
Would be lots of fun if acumilating gems through gameplay was a viable option.,2
,4
,5
I like 5 star material but it takes to long to get gems,5
Not the original. At. All. 6 days to build rooms? Nope. Not worth it.,1
"Better than the original! only downfall, is the gem system but  ehh! 5stars",5
,5
"Oh my..finaly mined enough gems to get my 5th imp and was quite pleased until I saw that the 6th imp is a $50 imp.  Update: Upgradeable walls sounds like a good idea, lets give that some more time.  You should make another building or certain traps upgrade with gold imo",3
Gets addicting,5
,4
Without paying for gems you can still be pretty competitive. You definitely notice how much harder it is to raid someone's dungeon who has spent money though. The cave-in bonus helps you rebuilt resources so your not constantly being attacked.  I cannot do much in one session without gems but it's nice distraction from work for 5 minutes here and there. Definately nothing like the original games where I could spend hours goofing off.,4
,5
Everytime My building are d3stored my games goes black and restarts to the beginning DO N1T DOWNLOAD,5
,3
,5
This game is really fun to play,5
The game has lot of bugs.  e.g. Guild missing and along with the chat log.  Require an constant on connection is crazy for mobile game (even a change from mobile to wifi within 5 sec will cause you to reload a game).    The latest update with upgradeable wall is a joke.  It totally ruin ppl 's plan and now no body stocking any stone for raid....,1
Almost like the original,5
,4
Gives Clash of Clans a run for its money,5
Mythic never disappoints me! :),5
But I am annoyed that we cant contact specific players or at least give a notification on guild chat,3
Manipulative money grabbing nongame masquerading as a reboot of an old favorite series.   There is no fun here. Just EA demanding money for every action. Stay away.,1
Love it,5
"To the people who have given this five star ratings and paid insane amounts of money in micro transactions to make this game's pace anything less than glacial and broken: you are the reason we can't have nice things. This greedy, craven money grab is just one more nail in the coffin of quality mobile gaming. If you came here thinking this pathetic offering would resemble the original Dungeon Keeper, let me disabuse you of that notion. I hope you enjoy waiting A DAY to clear a single square of your dungeon.",1
Keeps crashing and reconnecting can't enjoy the game,1
Seems fun but it keeps resetting and i cant get past the tutorial. So its stupid.,1
Tower defense game which is similar to the PC game I used to love playing.,4
,5
Fun game.  Gems too expensive and slow to accumulate without breaking the bank.,4
"The game already leave something to be wanted.  But since the last 2 updates,  randomly losing connection to the server mid raid is quite annoying.  If the DEV wants users to continue to play this already crappy game,  fix the connection issues.",1
,2
Its a good game love it already. :-) but it needs a lot of updates and it keeps restarting :-(,4
It really is just a great game,5
,2
Fun different and interesting,5
,1
You can spend more no these simple games than on a triple a game. That's just sad.,1
always updateÔºÅsucks,1
"Once you reach a certain point, you well be waiting most of a week for upgrades... unless you pay.",4
"Now that I'm over the initial return of a favorite game of mine.. This version pretty much sucks compared to DK classic. They tried to hard to make like COC and it worked, just not for me.",2
"Don't waste your time or money on this POS. Broken game mechanics, pay to wait, and nothing like Dungeon Keeper. Take your money elsewhere.",1
This USED to be one of the most stable games I have played however after TWO updates in ONE day I can't even get it to open without crashing and losing connection repeatedly spent an HOUR getting it to open to find that the bug report is bugged HAHAHAHA,1
Join the guild The Wolverines!,4
"I had recently updated this app only to find out when I now attack another player before it goes into the last screen to claim loot,  it no longer connects to  the server and kicks me back to my dungeon and I get jipped on loot.  So until this is fixed you now have 1 star.",1
,5
It's definitely not the original.  But I am glad to see these license being used.  Now they just need to revamp syndicate wars	Decent,4
Fun....makes you think about your strategy to win,5
If you don't mind waiting for hours or work alot it's a good game to continually check on however for a non casual gamer it can be frustrating especially lack of gems,3
This game is exactly what I was looking for,4
"This game is fantastic.  Long build times make for an enjoyable pace, and you get to slap your minions.  What's not to love?",5
"I guess it's fun, but on a phone it's difficult to get everything. I played a resource mining game on Facebook and that ate months of my life, so I'm kind of done with this.",3
This is just a pay to play game now. Latest update ruined the strategy I've spent days and hours setting up. Upgradeable walls are a joke. Why even build them. Game was fun when it was new but now with all the updates the game is ruined unless you are stupid or rich and spend countless dollars to play.,1
Cleared Cerimonial Killamajig several times 100%.  But it says I can still get 1 more gold from that level...,3
"But if you want to get anywhere, expect to drop some money.  You need a few extra imps to do well, and those cost real money to get ahold of.  Its a great game, but the cash strategy is bad.  To get the 6th imp is like $40.  Unreasonable.",4
I hate you.,1
"Recent updates seem to have broken support for the nexus 5, game has crashed on start-up for the last 3 days. Game has not properly closed out of raids for the last few updates, and performance has been declining in recent updates.  March 12 update. ISSUES STILL UNRESOLVED. Two months and counting.",1
Time consuming life altering,5
"Either vast patience or vast payments are required to play this.   After vast patience I've gotten to the point where I can act about once/day, and see results from any build in 3 days.  Boring.  I'd happily pay for a better experience, but the prices are ridiculous and still of limited duration of benefit.",2
Fun game.,4
Everything takes too long to complete once you reach a certain point and saving enough resources to upgrade is next to impossible.  Gems like to randomly disappear as well.  Waste your time playing something else.,1
,4
Come and play.,5
Can u put chat and on guild plz,5
I used to play this game a while ago this is a great port and it looks awesome to boot :),5
Very limited on the space you  can use. No way to move buildings around without wasting hours excavating. Chat is only by clan and is still broken with days worth disappearing at a time. Last update ruined purchase of strong walls forcing you to not only purchase the wall but to spend Much more to get the wall as strong as it should be in the first place.,2
"I've come to expect EA to overcharge every chance they get, & they've never yet proved me wrong, most obscenely, here. Sure, go ahead & download DK if you REALLY wanna try your patience, because you'll make no progress at all here unless you pay to play, or are literally willing to wait WEEKS to fully dig your dungeon out! Wanna speed it up? Get ready to ante up the cash! CS is worthless, too, so don't even bother asking for help!   Buggy, greedy, ever-patching EA f*@ks up another game! Uninstalled!!!",1
,2
"Let me, one of the players who started since day1 of original launch, tell you why----Because, the developer constantly makes BIG changes to the game that could make your intended investment greatly, greatly devalued, in a blink of an eye. They've done it frequently, almost every month or two. At first they say it's because of the game being ""soft-launched"" (which was never said officialy of the store page), and after launching the game globally in Jan 2014, they don't even care to give excuses anymore. I haven't paid a penny, and I'm sooooo glad that I stayed this way. If you question anything I said here is untrue, check the official forum and see how everyone says. GOOD LUCK:)",1
They ruined it from the original computer game I could play for hours on that may have had terrible graphics but was great on gameplay now its just like clash of clans and other crappy games,1
I really like this game,5
Tons of fun,5
,3
"In this game you spend three minutes at a time playing, and then DAYS waiting. As another commentor mentioned, if you spend money to unlock certain things, EA then changes the rules of the game, effectively wasting your money. EA has lost their touch with games. No longer a trusted brand.",1
Ok game,5
,4
,3
Shame... the game would have been great.,1
Addicted.,5
Ok,4
,5
Some ease put residue but only brown soda removes.,5
"With the new update its even more unbalance with the upgradable walls. You will find your needing stone all of the time, meanwhile your gold reserves are at or near full capacity. hardly any of the upgrades require gold. This affects the gameplay so much so that I am giving it 3 stars instead of 5.   It's the same scenario with clash of clans but at least with COC it's not really evident until you reach the very high levels. Here, it is evident immediately.",3
I was hoping it would be more like the original computer games but was disappointed. Some actions require too much time to complete.,4
Good fun,5
I miss the old days of playing this game on pc. EA has ruined this game with micro purchases and the horrific times it takes to do ANYTHING in the game!,2
"Used to be fun, but after the latest update crashes on the loading screen more often than not. Virtually unplayable at this point.",1
,5
I dont see what the fuss is about I like this game.. Join me an my friends in a new active guild metal mulisha an let's crush this game together!!!,5
"This is a watered down version of the former game that was Dungeon Keeper.  I would rather pay someone $100 to hit me in the stomach for even considering to buy ""gems""-the key to not having a terrible dungeon.  Sadly, I give this game 1 star in the hope that those reading will not buy any gems and save yourself the time grinding away to make a mediocre dungeon that will be raided by those who are spending money to have an advantage.  If you are enjoying this game, I'm happy for you. I did not.",1
Dungeon Keeper 2 on the PC is one of my favorite games of all time.  This is just a tedious drawing out of the first five minutes of that game.  Unless you want to pay through the nose for credits.  A month of playing and I didn't get anywhere.  So tedious!,1
"Best tablet game there is, just like original DK. ): ]",5
Soooooooooooooooooooooooo evil,5
Missed this game. It's good to be able to stock my dungeon with evil minions again,5
,3
Everything takes so long. You barely play unless you throw money @ it. Wait times of 24hours etc. Game gets boring fast. Also you insta-lose when you raid & get called.,1
When I first got it 4 stars. Updates and insane gem prices pushed it down to one. Would not need gems if upgrade times were not so long.,1
"It only requires time, not money. I love playing in spare time. You should join up and join the fun. It releases my stress when I smack my imps!",5
"In a day and age where everyone is putting out freemium games, I had bored this would be different. Instead it's free to download, but to get anywhere in a reasonable time requires gems you must buy from the site. Original was a classic.",3
"Not much to say, but it is just like the other buy gems, more workers the faster you build thing",3
Fun,5
"Those who have played the bullfrog games know this is not dungeon keeper. This is a sad attempt to capitalize on the IP. While the characters may be there, the gameplay is not. There are no heroes and no conquest and takeover of enemy dungeons. There's no clever strategy and everything takes an age to complete. No possession, no maintaining and levelling a denizen population ( all creatures are expendable). No hordes of imps. Just so sad. I support War for the Overworld.",1
I always loved playing DK1 and 2 on PC.,5
,5
,5
This is a wonderful revamp for a classic game. I spent many hours playing the old pc version. This new version has much of the charm and comedy of DK1 and DK2 but it has much better graphics than the original.,4
,4
I cant buy anything it keeps saying error. Once fixed for sure 5 star till then meh.,3
"All game for take your money, i want to play game not give money for the game that should do..",1
He's of fun and stress relief.,4
Great game,4
Good but won't load a lot and gems cost way to much,4
"Hmm, I wonder if I'll have to pay for any in game products... *looks at developer name*... OH it's EA! Of course I will!  $99 for gems for a mobile game. What the absolute f***. You can't be serious? The price for gems is stupid high. The return is even sh**tier. Don't pay for gems from these greedy bas**rds",1
"Awesome fun, great casual take on the original games. Love it.",5
,5
Fun and easy,5
"I've been enjoying the game for several weeks. Sure it may take time to dig out, but its worth it.",4
Why does this app need to know who I call? NSA much?,4
This EA change material in every patch a lot and make your money spending on the game meaningless.  I'm taking all my guild member to other game. That's what you get EA.,1
,5
"I really do love that they've taken a game I loved and made it mobile, and the actual functionality of the game and graphics and such are great..... But the micro purchases are some SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS!!!!!!! Seriously, $100 for anything in a mobile app is completely outrageous. If you spend that you're either stupid or insanely rich or both...",3
Okay I love this game its so much fun but since this last update I really can't do much of anything because it keeps disconnecting me and reconnecting me. I've tried wifi and using my data service and it does it on both. Which really sucks because I really like the game and it's unplayable.,5
"The game is entertaining, but dissatisfying because I thought it was like DK2",3
Game,5
Was cool at first but everything takes forever to build and using gems isn't even worth it.,2
Just for now,3
Awesome game.  Works great most of the time.  Only problem is an occasional loss of connection.,5
,5
Very intriguing game. Very addicting.,5
Great game,5
Constantly connecting and restarting. Fared slightly better on my tablet until one miss-tap lost most of my gems. Too frustrating.  Nexus 5 32GB,3
A couple of things are needed. Controlling a general rally point like in the pc version while in a battle. While defending deployed minions should automatically seek out invading enemies. Mana should be harvested as well. Maps are much too small. Generally make it just like the pc versikn,5
"(Updates in parentheses). Seems cool, but NOT if you want to play for free. Unless you buy gems with real money, you will wait double digit hours and even days for your tasks to complete (without buying gems building tasks now take literally 4 days around level 6-7, yes 4 days!) . Even simple things take nearly an hour (now usually 12 hours), especially with limited imps. Of course, you could buy more of them too. I have heard the earlier versions are great but this one will literally waste your time.",1
Been playing for a while.  Decent dungeon builder game with no direct need to buy anything in game unless you want to go faster. Fails to start some times just sitting at a black screen until I kill it.,5
"Im on samsung galaxy tab 3 and the update did not help. It still will not open and just closes when it says ""loading unruly minions"" Used to be a really fun app. Used to....",1
Great time killer,5
The game is becoming less linear and more diverse. The developers seem to be working on playability issues. It's getting there but the original concept was your evil fighting good. That is still missing and that is the heart of the game.,3
"Been crashing a lot lately. Been having to delete apps file data in my phone just to get it going again. Plenty of gems to start out with to get things going. Gems could be cheaper, or at least have lower fees, start with like $.99 or $1.99. Also, guild chat has been deleting itself, not showing up.",4
"Lots of fun. Great graphics, though force closed every time on my nexus 7.",5
Thanks for pillaging my fond memories of a fantastic series. Oh and canceling DK3. You guys suck,1
Was okay if not an obvious money grab to spend more than a couple minutes actually playing the game.  The reinforced wall patch was a jerk move by EA and destroys game balance.,2
Goes against the spirit of the original games. Obvious attempt to perpetually suck in-app purchases out of players.,1
Best now and then app I have played...yay mythic...just like the days on my old PD pc....,5
"Micro transactions almost everywhere!  Play for up to 3 minutes then wait for 10-30 to rebuild army to raid, or you can perform a micro transaction and play instantly.   Multiple $ imps useless, not enough resources to keep them occupied! Though you can pay $ to restock gold/stone and keep your bought imps occupied!  That's 1% of the problems, list goes on...  ^ nothing compared to what the game is now. 0 second stone upgradeS to create shortages, game economy manipulated / huge imbalance. UNINSTALLING!!!!",1
This is not a mobile version of the game I loved. This is a crappy way to annoy you and get into your wallet.,1
I missed playing on the computer.   This is a decent reproduction.,4
,4
,5
"Thanks EA for making it impossible to defend against invaders.  Your new ""improvements"" have destroyed what little balance there was to the game.  I look forward to the next classic you will butcher for the sake of money.",1
Very addictive!,5
Fun both in a normal way and in a sort of evil way love beating my imps but the wait time is so long Sometimes,4
This game is fun h,5
The voices are well done,5
You have to spend around $100 if you want to have enough imps and some of the other goodies. The most recent patch really screwed up the walls and made the dungeon too dark. (Hard to see) I won't be playing any more.,2
"Like the old version but constantly requires purchases to speed actions that are quite long. Not bad considering it is for mobile and ""free."" It is possible and fun still without purchases.  On the downside it keeps having me download updates.",4
Horrible game. Slow boring and wants you to  spend 100s for stupid gems. Utter crap .  What is the point of slapping my imps?,1
I love it,5
,5
(Kkkkkkkkkkk,4
This new update has me angry! BF plays and gets chance for extra imp. I don't because I only have two. Can't buy gems...ok so you don't want my money? Awesome I play Clash of Clans...they do!!!,1
,1
,5
Funny comments but other wise the same old build and play,4
Different,5
God I love this game very addictive and super fun.,5
"I was enjoying this game. WAS! I even spent money on it and yet I did not get my free IMP as was said I would get with my first Gem purchase. WHERE IS MY FREE IMP? And right after I made my purchase, the game crashed. It crashes 85% of the time I open it now.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it too and that doesn't even help.  Needless to say, I'm quite annoyed I spent money on this as I was enjoying the game until it kept crashing, and since i was basically robbed of my free IMP even though I purchased enough Gems to purchase my 4th IMP afterwards.  Either you fix this or I shall report this app, I don't care if its owned and created by EA. I don't like the fact that I was robbed! And I'm expected to spend more money on the game!",1
,1
Miss the floating hand to grab & slap minions.,3

"Wow. I've been wanting Dungeon Keeper 3 ever since 1 and 2 and I would gladly have paid top dollar for one. This however isn't a game, it's a hot mess crippled by essential functions like digging out rock requiring hours or days to perform (oh! Or pay us money every time! That works too!) It's obvious some work was put Into this version, but it's obvious as well that EA either doesn't have the confidence in the property to give it a real fully developed game or thinks that DK fans are desperate enough to play this un-fun slog and pay to make it serviceable (barely). Nuts to that, I say. I still have my DK1 and DK2 discs, DOSbox and compatibility mode and at least struggling with those for a few hours to get them running will result In a real game to play, not this betrayal of the franchise.",1
"However, it makes me realize how awesome the original game was. And how much this version is money grubbing; And kind of cartoonishly made for a younger audience.",3
"I figured the timer simply wasn't being displayed, but no. I have four imps and sometimes only one of them will actually be making progress while the rest are locked in doing nothing. One of my imps in particular I set out to dig a spot that was supposed to take 4 hrs (only 2 with the bonus), and yet 5 hours later it is still incomplete. The area they're working on is locked out with no timer, and I can't even pay gems to complete it. It just times out. EA fix this or refund me all of my money! This is B.S.",3
Love it,5
Game is fun and a nice spare time game. Constant crashes causes loss of minions when invading other players. White blank pop-up on game start is annoying. Scared to spend money on for loss of progress due to connection drops.,2
Nice remake however I keep seeing pop ups about free dk premium yet I can't seem to get it (playing on android),2
,4
Used to like this game til the update came and wanted to see info on my phone calls! Detailed info! What???!!! Why???? What does my phone calls have to do with the game?? Why do they want to know who calls me??!! No thank u and deleted with a one star change from a 5 star.,1
,5
Its good to be bad...,5
Game is ok it seems pretty much like to get ahead you gotta spend money.,3
Love the game. The only part im not a fan of are payfor options. Wish the game was just set like the classic. Oh well.,5
This is now like the best game ever,5
"I was a big fan of the original DK and the sequel. This one *REQUIRES* Internet access, which means they broke something.  Deleting from my device until they permit offline play.",1
,5
"Abit slow in progression sometimes.  Buying imps gets costly fast. I like the raids, but its also too easy for more powerful players to attack weaker ones. Should be more on level basis.",4
"Gems are too expensive.  While it is true that you can play without them game play quickly becomes game wait several days.  Imps are very expensive.  (1200) gems for the fourth, or 9.99.  There is no way to get gems very quickly in game.  I wish I could convert my gold and/or stone into them.    If I got more gems per dollar spent, I would be tempted to buy some, but just to get 3 more imps at the current scale rate will probably cost about $60.  Then I would still have to wait large amounts of time...",2
EA ruining a classic game with a cash grab. FU EA im done buying your crap!,1
"Tower defense games at their finest. Nicely implemented game play and so far in app purchases aren't already essential in order to make any progress at all. The only annoying thing is that they keep changing the cost for buildings and upgrades and I understand the game is still being balanced, but the changes seem to only serve making in app purchases more necessary to enjoy the game.",4
Great,5
,1
I go into my game a few times a day. I'm working on building up my dungeon. From the get go there are raids you can go on. It isn't one of those games you have to be glued to for hours but if you want to veg on it you go right ahead.,4
Nice feel of the old game with the new timer money stuff.,4
,5
Thanks,4
Love it and want more like it!!,5
Changes are great well thought out fixes,5
"Unless you purchase the in game currency, be prorated to wait days for things. I lost interest because I only needed to check into the game once a week.",2
Can't get enough.,5
I am a big fan of Dungeon Keeper I was really excited about the Dungeon Keeper app. But all I get with it is connecget to play as soon as it says your name your dungeon I can't make it. So after day I give up .,1
"Clicked on the free week of premium ad and somehow cost myself 750 gems.  Was so close to a fourth imp, and premium is pretty much useless to me...since my turns are days apart due to the horrible game mechanics.",1
Loved this game back on PC. Now my Droid plays it with better graphics.  Isn't technology wonderful? Now to figure out how to hyperslap my imps into 10x speed.,5
Reminds me of a psp game I played,5
"I've found the guilds get annoying because most of the leaders aren't active, but after creating my own guild I have got no issues. Join Eternal Abyss!",4
24 hour blocks are crap but its pretty fun otherwise i think.. still waiting to really play into it,3
"The worst pay to play system I've ever seen. Disgusting. Make a real game with this franchise, not this trash!",1
"Couple days after last update the game keeps crashing and stays on ""reconnecting...dungeon being put in order"". Have to keep shutting down and restarting which is very frustrating. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.",1
For the digitally sadistic its exempifies the eclictic arsenal well. No complaints,5
"I try not to play any game that bases itself on the in app purchases model, but that doesnt leave much in the line of free games anymore. So far I havent purchased any gems and I've found this game to be fun and challenging. You build up your dungeon by mining resources and looting opposing dungeons. You can raid campaign dungeons or other players'. It's slow going without buying gems but I think that's half the fun.",4
I love this game.  Fun strategy/rpg that takes the mobile games to a new level.,5
,1
You really have to find a way to be able to restart the game from the beginning until you can give the player the option to start the game over again from the beginning I'm not going to play this anymore the games not worth it,2
Great time killer,5
,5
Fun game... Easy to get stuck on this game!,4
Extremely fun and addictive,5
Love the game its just please fix server code 7 just because of it it doesn't get 5 stars,4
,5
Now I can unleash my evilness without actually have to leave my house.üëπüòàüê±üíÄ,5
You do need patience by building 2 things at a time per a certain time period. But once you get the hang of it is awesome.,5
,3
Awwwwwwwwwwesome,5
This is riddled with ton of microtransactions hindering me playing the game for more than a couple minutes. Why oh why cant I just pay 5 or 10 for it and unlock everything. People who pay these rediculous prices are killing the game industy.,1
I miss playing this on the pc.,5
Was stoked that DK was coming to mobile platform.  Was very dissatisfied with the way they chose to setup the pay to win system.  For me this game is unplayable in its current forum.,1
It's is supposed to be free. But tells me I have insufficient gems. Please let me know what I can do to get premium.,3
Loved the old bullfrog version... But the wait times are stupid. Ea should stop pretending this is free to play.,1
Real fun and addictive,5
,4
,5
,4
Wheee,5
Would be better if upgrades were cheaper,4
Lots of traps to play with,5
,5
Awesome,5
Problems I've had in the past have all been resolved. I do have trouble logging into the game consistently not sure if its the servers or on my end but it does get obnoxious. Guild filters would be great too many inactive guilds out there,4
Enough with the wait whining...  I can make strategy around wait times. There is a problem with this game beyond crap micro transactions.  There are cheaters in this game that never get attacked because they keep their app always online. Once again an EA/Origin game that rewards cheaters and pirates over legitimate players.  Also there is no way to redeem the Google Play 2-year anniversary promo that keeps getting advertised.,1
Great free game. Has a taste of the old DK 1/2 but not quite the same feel as it is meant to be played over days and has a much smaller map. Clearing all but the starting area is very time consuming making for large growing pains if your trying to keep up defenses,4
"So far so ""good""",4
I really like the game  No complaints...yet,5
Got bored uninstalled,3
A little to much pressure to buy gems and lousy support if there is a snag in the purchase process,4
Best game.,5
I am king,5
Love this game haveloved it since the 90's thanx for remaking it,5
"Not even funny.  This is the worst ""free to play"" I've ever seen.  It's just sad that for many of this generation this model of games is all that they know, and that so many give it five stars.  They probably have never even seen the original version of this game. Something has to change, or people will continue to be taken advantage of by the likes of EA just because of greed for money.  You're better off buying the real full game for five bucks rather than this scam.",1
takes some time to build but that's aright,4
Good so far. I will update as I play more.I really like it. The wallpaper is really cool too.,4
Has a good concept yet this free-to-play craze cripples the game with its almost mandatory in-app-puchases. I still dont believe this business model is as profitable as it is. Especially in our economy.,2
I'm a fan of this game so far a couple issues it's hard to move objects accurately I often times find myself removing a wall by mistake another issue it should not take a full day to remove one section of wall there are way too many for that period of time aside from that great game keep it up,5
runs great on the new phone the galaxy no real glitches just wonderful gameplay and you don't really have to buy too much stuff not a lot of money hungry Grover people out there,5
Fun game easy to pick up hard to put down!,5

Djjdif,5
"Yes, I am biased because of Hard Hat Mack for the Crapple IIe. Look it up all you young uns.",5
"The game itself is fun, sure, but it loses a lot of the old DK's flavor in the conversion to a microtransaction riddled subscription game. This could be alleviated by giving gems a greater value (increasing their purchasing power), and making it so you can buy more than two imps without paying. Not all of them, even! Just, say, three or four. One or two more than can be recruited right now. The elements are there, but right now the cost to play this game is so exorbitant I can't justify recommending it. Thus, 2 out of 5.",2
This game makes me think a lot for being creative and enjoy the time killing part. I can wait for a few hours while something upgrades and its that same feeling like clash of clans but in s different concept.,5
"Plays like a casual gamer version of the original.  Enjoyable for what it is, but pales in comparison to the pc version.",4
Awesome imersive play,5
"Just as I remember it from way back! Good times, shame the dig times are so annoyingly LONG on anything but soft rock! Wish they'd fix that so it'd be more fair/fun...",5
"The game is fine, it has a nice UI, a fine tutorial, and the graphics are good enough.  BUT... its too much like a facebook game for me to become entierly invested in. Granted, its not like SOME games... but its still bad. Overall, the game is fine, wouldn't exactly recomend it if you want to waste some time, but at least something to do. I particularly like how you can slap the imps as much as you want, and as a result you get faster workers for a while +_+",3
Fun game. Reminds me a lot of clash of clans. Just a little bit smaller now but I can see this going places. Clash of clans with a new demon twist. I like it.,5
,5
Fun game. Comedy included,5
Great game and lots to do.,5
Great time passer,5
,1
Sad to see the franchise finally return only to join the ranks of the pay to win/enjoy garbage.,1
Play this!!,4
,5
It was the best game I played,5
Addictive,5
Would of liked to have seen a more traditional dungeon keeper. Was disappointed,2
"Best game to enjoy the time and money that you could invest,money is optional.",5
Read above enough said,5
"Once established, it's nice to check in every so often and give your imps a slap. (For motivational purposes of course)",5
Very fun to play,5
Its awesome get it,5

This game rocks,4

This game is well constructed but the pay walls are enormous. 4 hours to clear a single tile is outlandish.,3

Its nice like that gameplay,4

"It's a shame that I don't have the option to get the game as it should be. The wait or pay mechanic turns this awesome game into a parasitic impulse inducer. Super lame. If the PC version was available I'd have totally paid for it. Instead I play the turtle game and pay nothing. Again, super lame.",1
"I played for a week or so even payer money for gems , now I can't even log in on my HTC EVO 4g, skips the imp slap ""reconnects"" then crashes to my home screen. I tried in my kindle fire and that's a big fail as well . What a huge waste of time and money, and its a spit in the face to the original two pc games",1
,5
A very interesting new twist on the old Dungeon Keeper,4
,5
Needs some fine tuning. Grafics are solid. Maybe some gameplay functions need review,3
"Started out fun and turned into grinding tedium.  Unless you are willing to pay for gems or wait days for things to happen, don't bother.",2
Decent strategy game not perfect but what is?,4
Easy to use app.,4
Completely addictive,4
Cool,5
,5
"Cool graphics,  nice commentary. .. seems fun for the first hour or so.   Hopefully it continues.",5
Very I terrain in but a constant hustle for money,4
I used to place this on the computer. It's so much better on the phone.,5
be sure to disable ART!,5
Used to play this game years ago on the PC. It never gets old!,5
This app is amazing. Absolutely love it. Runs smoothly and I haven't had a bug in a couple of months now! Really fun too!,5
"Great game, fun and dosnt keep crashing.",5
Constantly freezing my entire phone.  Otherwise I love the game and play all the time...just a real buzzkill when I have to restart my phone.  Please fix,2
Great game,5
I couldnt get past naming my dungeon. If I figure out a way then I will give more stars.,1
Super fun rts tower d,5

"Great at first but rating 1 star because after an hour of game play you literally cannot progress without RL money gems.. Unless you want to play for 30 seconds then log off for 4 to 24 hours before things complete. Even minions take 10 mins to build, and that's all the time I usually have to play on a cell game! The worst part of all is that it takes 5mins just to get in the game! Uninstalling. Wtb desktop dungeon keeper.",1
I love the original Dungeon Keeper on my pc.  I still play it to this day. This is a great little mobile set-up for this game. Nice job!,5
"Good very good!,,",5
It is designed so that you have to spend gobs of real world money or wait ridiculous amounts of time to do anything...,1
Well balanced gameplay that allows you to play for free or to accelerate your advancement by spending some $$$. But thoroughly enjoyable even without spending a dime.,4
Ok,4

Lame,1

I cant wright enithing,1

"Have all imps working but game glitched and sometimes shows one available even though all three are busy. Also have a gem transaction that is stuck in limbo. App page says email one support team, game says another. Both no help nor answer to get credit for gems even though I was charged for them  Update: finally got support for issue game little better, kinda just drags on",3
"I like this game so far. I enjoyvbuilding and attacking and this game has both, lol.",4
Pretty good game. Not too different from any others but still entertaining all the same,4
I loved Dungeon Keeper 2 on PC. This tablet version its ridiculous. I only have two imps and no gems to summon more. Everything in this game takes forever and the rewards are so menial. I just don't feel like spending money on this game.,3
Game charges real money for you to play at any kinda normal pace...hope they come out with this on ps3,1
,4
It'd be far more fun if (1) it didn't either crash or fail to connect half the time and (2) didn't take forever to do anything. It's basically like Clash of Clans only nowhere near as polished.,1
"This has go to be a joke ....... I made a purchases of gems , paid the money but still have not received my purchase ... I submitted a report, and your company tells me to check out your frequently asked questions.... Are you serious???? Eather I get my purchase or I file a a fraud report",1
,5
Completely ruined an awesome game.,1
I love it,5
I like it very fun make a maze and fight,5
This game is a trip!,5
I love the concept of this game! Very entertaining app but gems can be expensive to upgrade things or buy extra minions but 20$ here and there doesn't hurt if you got it. If you don't ha e patience then don't play this game.,5
,4
,5
This game is fun,5
"Its a fun app, but the in app purchases and build times are ridiculous. The game is almost nothing like the originals as well, but that is understandable since it is a mobile game. But seriously, 4 hours and 24 hours on some blocks is just a stupid money-grabbing technique.",2
,4
"No game here, just in app purchases.",1
"There's a message that pops up at beginning of the game claiming for a limited time you can have free premium boosts. Go to boosts screen and it says that it will cost 750 gems. Game is a boring grind-fest anyway, so It doesn't matter that much.",3
,5
EA your game made me realize why you where voted worst company in the world....in the world mtfrs,1
This is a good game Hurry up app people put number 2 of dungeon keeper on,5
Its worthless.just force closes after about 1 minute. Don't waste your time,1
,2
Fun,5
,4
,5
,5
This pay to play model has got to go. You would be a fool to pay any amount to support exhaustible IAP's.,1
Beast,5
In App purchases are the only way to compete. Waste of time otherwise.,1
,5
Played over a few days....not worth the time. Go play the original to see what the game should be,1
Game play way too slow. A huge let down from old Dungeon Keeper apps of old.,2
Its great and all but they should make it less hard to upgrade the stuff,5
"Great game, not as pay to play as people make it out to be, already a force to contend with and only casually played for about 2 weeks. Devs support it very well!",5
,5
Cool game..just a few bugs,4
"Friend got me to start, now I'm hooked! Beautifully made game! Only thing it could use is making it a tad easier to get imps. Just a thought",5
This is so addicting and fun,5
New age tecmos deception but with newer elements that wont disappoint,4
,5
More free gems needed,3
Weeeeeeeeeeee,5
Reminds me of the PC version I played as a kid! Can't give 5 stars because it sucks up WAY too much battery and sometimes only displays a black screen when it starts.,4
Fun to a point but to much is dependent on buying the gems other wise it takes forever to do anything. It could have been done a lot better. Good try though,3
"It's hard for a fan of the series to play this title. Taking on a crappy new look, mashed up with a horrible play-style, effectively killing what DK used to be. Also, often times I leave the game and have to redo whatever mission I've just completed.  I do love the narrator VO though... that's about it. Try this game out and never play it again.",2
"I've never played a more boring game in my life. It feels like work more than a game. ""Well my 4 day upgrade is done. Better get on and make something else to wait for."" Who thought this would make a fun game? Also online only? So people with unstable connections have to pray they can accomplish anything? EA, you're making my heart hurt. I liked your games, but then you put out these games...",1
,5
I did play the PC version. However I am enjoying this version as well. The new ways of games and getting gems don't seem to be going anywhere...,4
I like how you get to raid other people's dungeons.,5
Thanks EA for bringing it back out!!!!,5
Would be better if u could deposition minions after placing them in defend missions,4
,4
"Cute, but in no way like the original games. This is what you play for 5 minutes before you have to wait a day to play again.",2
Takes forever to level up but it is fun,5
Need to buy to much,4
"By far this was my favorite game growing up, and although Bullfrog is long gone and the game has lost some of it's malevolence it's nice to see Horny and the gang again. My only complaint really is WHERE ARE THE DARK MISTRESSES",5
Fun game with friends,4
This game sucks and you can't even give it less than 5 stars within the game. EA is gay.,1
,5
Like the game a lot. Its fun and is it wrong to love the booster for the imps? You liberally slap them to get a bouns. Lol only gripe is its hard to gain gems to unlock other imps.,5
Massive fun,5
"Great game fun , wish it was faster to get diamonds and smaller space required for rooms",5
"Just as entertaining as the original.  Despite the outrageous cost of imps, it earns every star.",5
Nuff said. EA got themselves a winner. My only complaint is how hard it is to amass gems.,4
Good game,4
"As a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series by Bullfrog, I can say that this is nothing more than an abuse of the original IP from Bullfrog. The game is woefully sub par and focuses mainly on forcing users to purchase in game currency. Calling them micro transactions is a lie as well the in game currency is being sold at a rate vastly inflated when compared to what you actually get. You would have to spend hundreds of dollars in order to play the game as if it were a real game for a whole week.",1
Oh the hours I spent playing this on my computer.....,5
Good,5
Super fun!,5
"First thing I do in the morning,  last thing I do before bed, lol. I'm hooked!",4
"Spent cash to advance and today for some reason game was reset and lost 400 gems I paid for sent email to EA.  LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF ANYTHING...up date,...very good app NICE...!",4
"Have put many hours into this one and find it to be thoroughly enjoyable.  The best part for me is that I only put in a few minutes at a time throughout the day and over the course of a few days am implementing grander strategies than in game time alone would suggest, I find myself tweaking my dungeon in my head throughout the day.  I would like to be able to have some control over where my minions go, perhaps choosing ""closest room"" or ""dungeon heart"" for each type of minion on my own rather than defaults.",5
Crashes my phone but I can play on tablet so mixed feelings on this one.,3
Right in the nostalgia feels man. I love you :') ea games will you marry me??,5
In app purchases don't appeal to me...,1
"OK, despite the fact that the app doesn't ever load (forever ""connecting"") after the first time on my Nexus and I have to clear data before I run the app each time; I genuinely like the game.  However, the mechanics changes to shift this to premium make it boring. 2 days or $10 to upgrade? Really? I'd much rather pay $5 and have the full game.  When I'm not waiting 24 hours to dig out a single block of rock, I do like the RTS aspect.  The font is very small and hard to read as well, unless you're zoomed-in.",3
This game is absolute crap. Do NOT download,1
"I loved playing this years ago, but the only version available won't even play on a current computer. I have been waiting for a new version to come out and am pleased.",5
Could this game be any slower?,1
Good fun,5
lots of fun,3
,1
,5
Its a great game :) Especially for free!!! Luv it,5
Best game on any tablet,5
You will be hard pressed to get more than 3 imps without paying.  It can be done but frankly it would take so long that you would get bored.  The times for mining and upgrades should be cut in half to keep people interested enough to come back.,3
Fun game bit tedious sometimes.. just be patient..,4
Always room to grow,5
,4
"5 stars great game , just like I remember it on pc...well kind of.",5
,4
Do possession spell and you get 5 stars.,4
Good game and concept....worst thing is the price to have 6 imps and not enough reward for it honestly,5
I like this game,5
Oodles of fun and can actually play for free,5
Game is unaplayable without spending money in the store. Actual gametime on the free to play is 2 minutes.,1
Every single time i try to play it says error problem connecting to server try again shortly and at first i thought ok maybe i had a bad connection but that was THREE DAYS AGO and every time since then it loads but still says the same thing so I'm uninstalling the BROKEN game  Stay away from this,1
"Changed my review, but not the stars. Had a significant time to play the game and I am still disappointed in the dynamics of the game. Level 9 warehouse? Sure, 5 days later.  Really!?! No reason to drag out upgrading those buildings, at the very least, since they have no impact on your game. Gems and the number of imps you have are ridiculous impediments that only serve to make the game longer, and not in an interesting way. Fighting is ok, but then you have resources with no way to spend them.",3
A bit confusing at first but really enjoyable once you get the hang of it.,4
Love this game!,5
From a game tester I love here better than it on the computer,5
,1
a sad remake of a great game,1
,5
,3
,4
,4
I just wish imps were easier to get.,4
Could b cheaper for buildings b and up grades,4
Great game,5
Tim Curry or the person who sounds like him really makes this game enjoyable,4
I like it but getting gems can be a pain.,4
Easy time killer,4
Freemium,1
Good app,5
,4
Don't like how long everything takes and that it relies on paying to play. I'd rather buy the game and then be able to play. Make it more about strategy than how much you're willing to spend.,2
How can I reset my dungeon,4
Good,5
Wish there was less loading,5
,5
It doesn't catch the feel of the original very well but it tries I guess. The pathfinding and AI are terrible. When a minion's bio says it attacks the nearest room it should do that. They should also take my shortcut when I blow up walls instead of intentionally walking through traps. Guilds could use some work too.,2
it's just about gating you with time that you must purchase your way through.,1
"Overall this game is pretty fun..  Join my crew n get some benefits right off the bat.  It's ""techn9cians""",5
"Let me begin by saying, I am a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper. I expected things to change a little for the switch to android from the PC, however I was wrong. Rooms went from being any shape and size you wanted to a set size for each room and set number of each room. Minions no longer need lairs or hatcheries to be happy but merely to get more units. The units no longer show up dependant on how well you run your dungeon, you just pay for what you want. 1D to mine out gems is rediculous as well. Out of room....",1
I like its sense of hummer,4
Only the same as the original games in name only. But hey this is what Ive cone to expect of EA. Been voted worst company multiple times.,1
"Fun to start but,  after a week it sucks...  Unless you pay lots for jewels It takes two days to build or upgrade anything. Not fun to be attacked for days and have nothing to do until it's time to upgrade it all again and wait another two days.....",1
,5
"Cmon, 4 day wait times for upgrading a building?  $100 is now a microtransaction?  The game play is infuriatingly slow.  Patience I undetstand but this is stupid.  Any developer or contractor working for EA ought to be ashamed of themselves.  The game itself is quite well done with good gameplay except for my gripes above that absolutely ruin it.   If gems had been $5 you would have gotten my money.   Instead you get  DELETED  Go @$!# yourself EA.",1
"I played the original Dungeon Keeper for PC. This game is a far cry from that game. It's fun to be sure, but suffers from the all too common ""pay to win"" syndrome. I see players who can easily older power me, and yet have strange stats. I know it's their money and if they want to waste it fine. Just wish it was more fair.",4
Definately nothing like the original but worth a try. Hopefully they do come out with DK3. Join my guild and help us progress. The Cenobites,4
,4
I love being a Dark Overlords and have a army of Minions and keep the graphics the way they are please,5
Addictive :),5
Awesome to play when bored,5
"But, it makes me long for the original PC version which was excellent!",4
Gold,5
"I loathe micro transactions but I've never seen them quite to this scale. The game isn't slowed from not buying these ridiculous gems, it is stopped. The people giving this game five stars are half-wits.",1
Cool so far but just started the game,5
Fun go play,5
,4
"Omg this was real,y cool",5
,4
Reminds me of the old comp game. Dumbed down of course but still nice.,5
Nice depth and development,4
,5
,1
"Very well put together game. EA is a horrible company, but I am enjoying this title.",5
Do not pay for gems in this game it always loses connection and that's when you can even get on. EA needs to update their server and then I'll give it more stars.,1
,5
One of the best games,5
The game would have gotten 5 stars if I would have gotten the free boost that showed on my screen for Google Play's 2nd birthday.,2
I liked the original DK1 & DK2 but this isn't really the same as those. Still enjoyable though. But it does take a lot of patience (or money) for you to get much done.,3
I love this game its absolutely amazing!!! A must have for avid app players!,5
Not bad,5
,4
Able to play through without paying. Have a lvl 6 dungeon heart and haven't spent a dime. Community is interactive through guild.  I like that other players can attack my dungeon and experience my traps =],4
,4
Like it alot,5
,4
"Funny, off kilter, weird, this game is so fun it's a sin if you pardon the pun.",4
The Times are a bit too long for accomplishing tasks.,3
Sweeeeeeeet,5
Lots of fun designing your dungeon! Tons of ways to defend.,5
"This could, like it's PC based predecessors, be an incredibly entertaining Sim-Dungeon game. Unfortunately, the slow rate of acquiring gems - and the emphasis placed on making the user buy gems - make it a de facto ""pay for play,"" and the requirement to connect to the internet to play limits its usefulness to those times when one has a WiFi connection.  Poor show, EA. This could be have been amazing.",3
So far pretty fun.  Lots of reconfigurations available.  A good puzzle game as well.,5
,5
Play a few types of games like this but dungeons keep has kept my attention way better :),5
,5
,5
But redundant,3
,1
,4
,5
"... I really wanted to give this game a chance but the Game constantly drops and restarts. I keep losing gems that I earned and also, I only have 2 imps and one will not do anything. Game play is slow and annoying as it is. I am quite bummed that this game is is so off the mark... Dial down the build times and costs please. This could be a 5 star game but I will only give 3. The Audio, graphics are pretty great and of course Richard Ridings makes the game what it is and brings it to life - thanks mate!",3
"As a HUGE fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, I am impressed with how they have integrated the feel of the old school game into a modern ""phone app"".    That being said... I would pay real money (keep in mind this game is free) for a version like the games of old.",5
,5
This is why i uninstalled but fun game... too bad it  didnt work out,3
Definitely been in search of a game like this.  Just enough to keep you occupied in short term with rewarding goals for the long game.  To top it all off has entertaining wit and easter eggs to boot!,5
Terrible slap in the face to the previous games. This app is denounced by the original creator of the first DK as well.,1
,1
,5
Sadly I did not expect to see my beloved dungeon keeper series be reborn as a mmorts but I suppose that is just a sign of the times! For what it is it isn't bad and the micro transaction need is kept minimal provided you are a patient player.,4
My only issue is like most free games they need to make their money somewhere and like most free games they pick the right spot to do it. If you have a lot of patience this is a great game.,4
Horny is good,5
,5
,5
Cool,5
I'm changing my opinion on this game it's vary vary fun and yes I played DK1 & 2 and loved them both with a passion but this for a phone game is outstanding so what if it takes time to do things it keeps it interesting the gem's were just a plus for us if everything only took 10 min this game would done in a week and ppl would complain it's to easy this game is 5 star material. . Not gonna lie tho I like bull frogs more serious look in the game rather EA's make everything look funny thing.,5
Gotta buy gems to get imps to build quiker,4
,5
Blatantly seeks monetization by making everything take forever,2
This game is great if you like blank black screens. That is all it does.,1
it would be easier to get people to join your guild,3
Very addicting and very fun,5
"Kept having problems after cave ins ended, game just black screened after reloading.  Ended up deleting.",1
Not bad.,3
Rip off it won't let me play it it says downloading update and won't let me do anything,1
Best game ever,5
I do wish it didnt take so long to load though,5
,5
Finally got this for android.,5
,5
,5
,4
Awesome and a lot of games are like clash of clans,5
Sososossosososososos not gay,5
Awesome,5
This game is a lot of fun lots of building and fighting,5
Good,4
,5
I just started th is game and I already love it.,5
"It has the DK name, and some of the same characters/units, but otherwise is nothing like the original DK games. IAPs are persistent and everywhere, it's very difficult to progress without real money transactions. Disappointed by this misuse of the DK branding.",1
"If you're not into paying for games then this one will go a little slow, but it's still a lot of fun. You can pop in for 5 minutes and accomplish something.",4
Nice game,5
This is a very funny game and one to hold one to. the connection to the server could be better but that may be my fault idk....three months playing the game andi still love it and think it is silly. i am hoping the dungeon expands later in the game.,5
I really lik it but put more monsters that would be awesome and lov EA,5
,4
,5
Nice Graphics,4
Good game even if you don't buy the extras,5
"It's an ok game, a shadow of the older pc version. work on the load time. I wait about 4 minutes for 3 minutes of playtime.",3
,3
,4
Game is 100% pay to win,4
With cheese,5
,5
,5
"EA, I am stuck at giving you one star but you can purchase additional stars for this review at $14.99 each.",1
Nice game/time-waster.,5
,4
I bought gems and never got  them after and now all I get a connecting screen...,1
,5
It just ok,3
At first I was OK with playing the waiting game. .. But 48 hrs to upgrade one room. .24 hrs to remove one block... forget it  I'm deleting this game right  now! They can have the $5 I spent but sure as heck aren't getting anymore!,1
"I love the concept of the game, but it just isn't fun. I have gotten pretty far into it and now all of my timers are 3 days+ to do anything. This is ridiculous. I just want to have fun playing the game. And I'd buy gems but the cost to benefit is ridiculously low. Also summoning units takes way to long as well. Again...I just want to have fun playing the game not be stuck for hours and hours with nothing to do but slap my imps",1
How do you make it,5
I purchased gems but never received them on my acct!,1
Since the other day I get disconnected constantly,2
EA knows how to take advantage of my childhood,4
Pay to play is bullshit,1
,3
"I will update this as I go along. After a while, it takes 24 hours to mine a single block",3
"They took everything about the pc original and removed it. Then they inserted in app purchases that are obfuscated and expensive.  Way to destroy a great franchise.   If you download this game play it for 3 days and have marginal fun,  then delete before you get tricked into buying something!",1
Keeps me entertained as of now,5
"This game is a fun game to pick up and go, play and wait BUT it is too slow! 5 day build time?!?! If you have a lot of patience then this game is great for you. Definitely not action packed but fun strategy game",4
Very similar to the original PC game.,4
"Not a bad conversion of the original. It has enough going for it to keep playing, but the original is still king.",4
,5
W9ooooooooooooooooooo,5
"I play this on my Android and i spend more time trying to make repairs than building. Whenever i try to zoom in or out the game says oh destroy these walls ok. Or move this building. Also trying to place traps or walls is difficult as well causr you have to find the sweet spot on the item to move it around, it takes several tries. Other than that game is fun.",2
,5
Good,4
Good game,5
Greatest game ever!,5
"The game is entertaining, but it's hard at times to ignore the ever present microtransactions that the game doesn't even try to dress up. I don't mind IAPs, but doing it in this game makes you feel like you threw the money out of a moving car.",5
Game,5
"Bought gems for $20.00 that never showed up in game. No way to contac5 developer in the game, even following instructions from their website.",1
,5
,5
Leisurely paced game and fun.  Freezes occasionally.,4
It's interesting for nostalgic purposes but its not the same game.,2
,4
"While I find this enjoyable, the social structures from Facebook games in this incarnation of DK hold it back. Everything costs time to build, whether excavating the dungeon or recruiting units. It will take a lot of your time unless you use the in-game premium currency (gems). Honestly, I wish there was a buy-to-play version of this that didn't have the ridiculous timers that are required to build your dungeon.",4
Fun,3
"Awesome game, not as good as the old DK II version for the PC, (windows xp version) but it's a very good substitute. Only complaint is how expensive the Imps are and how slow it is to mine the gems to buy more Imps.  Thank you!",5
Its fun to kill time but can take a long time to get some of the jobs done. Sad to see this as a pay to play.,2
,5
,5
,5
Not to bad....,5
"Very slow going, but for your real money you can enjoy it. Recommend buy the real game on PC.",3
Great gamel,4
Very fun,5
Great interface.  Love the way the game works.,5
Great game,5
,5
"Some buildings and upgrades take to long, you kinda lose interest. Wish you could change gold/stone into gems to help speed things up.",4
Fun,5
Was confused for slowness and so few imps. Then getting used to it and I keep getting code 17 imps won't load. Loved the original game. When the bug is fixed I will give it another chance. Really disappointed,3

"I really love playing this game it helps with getting rid of some free time if you guys decide to play come join my guild its called, We Have NoFear",5
,4
,5
One of my favorite computer games of all time just wish this version was more true to the original,4
The most expensive game ever. You will never stop buying. Don't waste your time. Still a ripoff,1
It's a great multilayer game and I love it,5
Worst game ever. Anyone who rates over 2 stars is a shill.,1
I really enjoy this game it's a little different frm the rest..,5
Great fun game never played DK before but everything takes an eternity to build. Or you can buy OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive gems which will things up but the ridiculous of the  price of them is stupid,4
"Thought I'd be getting Dungeon Keeper, instead I get another ""Clash of Clans"" If I wanted to play that crappy game I would have got it. Disappointed, it is nothing like Dungeon Keeper aside from the look.",2
Virtually impossible to play with out in game purchases and a lot of waiting. Not the Dungeon Keeper you remember.,3
I love this game. Brings back memories. The gem purchasing is irritating.  I would rather pay $20 for the game once.,4
,4
Good and fun,4
,5
,5
Interesting concept if you aren't into fast twitch paced games,4
They took what could have been an awesome game and killed it with incredibly long delays that you can only skip by spending premium currency. A day to dig out one block? Needing to dig out hundreds of blocks to afford one imp? Who the hell playtested that and thought it was fun?,1
,5
"Fun to play, runs well, hand speed any bugs yet...",5
Building your own dungeon is so fun!,5
"A great game with deep gameplay, and outstanding tutorials. The offense\defense is a nice twist on the genre.",5
"Ah, dungeon keeper. A good ip, but now something different. If you go into this expecting it to be like the old pc games, I am sorry. It's a timer based game, ala Farmville.    That being said, it's still better than most. Graphically very good, and the game play has a modest amount of depth for what it is.   I think a lot of the hate this is getting is because of the ip it's attached to. If it would have been released as a generic game, perhaps it would be reviewed better overall.",4
Fun,3
"The wait times for developing your dungeon are ridicoulus, but if you spend you gems you can speed up the process.",1
,5
Game Play is incredibly slow unless you buy in game items. Really should be balanced better. Wouldn't waste time unless you're a fan of the original. Even then I'd think twice.,2

"Annoying push notifications, mandatory online play agreement, requires purchases to play well.",1
Friend got me hooked love love can't put down,5
"I'll be playing for a random amount of time, then out of nowhere it says ""reconnecting"" please wait while your minions get your dungeon in order. Then it crashes... Every time... Please fix this",4
Great,5
Some,5
Money hungry much?,1
,4
"I dont care what the sweaty nerds say, I still like it.",5
,3
I just don't want to stop..,5
Takes a popular old game and mangles it with pay-to-play mechanics. Its sad to see a classic monetized in this manner. Don't support this type of game with your money or your time.,1
,5
"The game is lots of fun, you should buy 1 emp to help builds.",5
This game is fun for all who have played the PC game in the past,5
This game is really fun. It remaineds me of a game way back.,5
Just like the original!,5
Remake of a PC classic on a mobile platform.  This is great fun.,2
,4
"I enjoy the concept a lot, but a little glitch when I'm bulibing things.",4
"This game is fun as a blast from the past, but be aware that this game will take weeks to do anything effectively if you don't spend real money.  Otherwise I love it!",4
How many more pay to win games do we need? I'm going back to Impire...,1
"Yet another ""game"" where the primary dynamics are Microtransactions and waiting... but it is fun for the 6 minutes a day you get to use your imps.",2
Awsome,5
Trying to buy gems but i cant!!! It keeps saying wait for last transactions to be complete,3
,5
And you do too,1
Fun,5
"Fun game, but the disconnects are super annoying.  It makes sense when you're doing multiplayer, but when you're doing the campaign or the event raids, why do you lose your progress/minions/mana if you get disconnected?  It seems easy enough to remember where you were, the game is constantly syncing (i.e. using battery/network).",3
,5
,5
Fun game to pass the time. No running problems I'm on note 2.,5
The inability to command a minion once placed is ridiculous. The inability to spend mana or gold only gems for imps is stupid. The only saving grace is that I have nothing better to do at the moment.,3
"Graphics are nice but not enough to make up for the fact that this is just a ""Clash of Clans"" clone. I'd shell out some dough if EA did an update of their old PC game.",2
Pretty fun game to pass the time,4
Super fun and addicting! Darkside clash of clans!,5
"You quickly reach a point in this game where unless you only want to accomplish one thing a day,you need to pay real cash. Also, if the game glitches while you are in a special raid, you lose everything and to re-do the raid costs you. It's almost a fun game, and certainly a good idea for one, but EA really just wants your cash. I literally only open this game once a day now to start my imps on their next day-long project, then I go find a more rewarding game to play... Those I'll pay real $ for.",2
A blast from the past! Fresh spin on a classic,2
Very poor design. Not enjoyable workout spending money. Obviously a cheap shot at using a beloved name to make a buck,1
,4
Lol gems could be a bit cheeper. But over all a good game.,5
Its fun,4
"One of my favorite games on PC, ported nicely to Android. I LOVE IT. There used to be MANY disconnects, (very few now) and it got very frustrating, but it seems like they've fixed it as of around March 1st. Now I can honestly give this game 5 stars.  WAY TO GO EA!!!  Dungeon play/strategy/upgrades/mining - great Graphics - not so fast/graphic'y on my low end equipment, better phones/tabs will run it beautifully. Multiplayer,protections, notices, etc. - excellent Raids - FUN and challenging Upgrades take days at higher levels, but most games are like that..",5
,5
Awesome,5
"The dungeon pathing adds order to the normal chaotic army attack games. The graphics, sound, and details are spectacular. And the guild system offers great benefits to players who work together.   I have written to the studios before over some small issues I observed and they were already on top of it and had it patched within a week.  Lastly, this is truly free to play. Spending real money only speeds the game up, instead of breaking balance.  Even in the games ""mid range"".",5
"Been playing since release without spending any money and still having a ton of fun and remaining competitive and that's exactly why I plan to spend some. Pacing is great and I'm always able to play as much as I want be it building or PVP or missions. Voice actor is beyond anything I've heard in a mobile game, music is fantastic, art style is fun and appropriate. Best mobile game hands down.",5
Good,5
Fasho,5
"But ftp is a lie, it's a daily 5 minutes of my time, but I am not going to give them a red cent.",2
Was pretty good till it stopped connecting to servers.  If it can't connect.. it can't stay on my phone,2
,5
Can not connect to server error on mobile and WiFi.,1
"The in game economy has slowed dramatically, yet all the upgrades are rather expensive compared to the actual pace of the game. I suspect this is intended to encourage the player to spend more cash on gems, but all it does for me is make me not like the game as much. Maybe with some more fine tuning this can once again deserve 5 stars.",5
I hope they put dungeon keeper 2 on here,5
,4
And very funny,5
Although I wouldn't mind more micromanagement. Such as unit squads or kitchens and stuff more my minions.,5
His game brings back memories of when I use to watch an older friend play this game. Love it!,5
Lots of fun.,5
Great game should totally get it If I were you.,5
Nice game,5
,3
So here is my beef I know I am going to love this for at least the next month or two but kinda of like other builders put some elements in to expand this game soon after please I would even re download for 3-6 $ As long as I could get my account back.  Also I am getting a new phone soon so I may be writting to you about getting my data moved over if any problems. Case in point I love this game a lot please work to make it even better although darn near perfect for my standards and as always love you EA,5
Fun twist on tower defense games.,5
Good game,5
Fun and silly,5
Love it very addicting,5
,4
I used to play dk2 on the PC. This is an awesome app to continue the experience,5
Takes way too long to load,4
,5
,4
Fun game.,4
Try it you'll love it,5
At first it Looked and worked good on my Nexus.,3
I'm really loving this game.,5
"This is the kind of game we all want to see more of on androids. This is a full fledged PC game that they're offering for free with micro transactions.   The good - This game is definitely fun has a lot of depth to it will keep you playing for hours.   The bad - Mid battle it will disconnect you even if you have a strong  network connection from the game server resulting in a drop of whatever you're in the middle of doing, this is horrible. Without this flaw it definitely 5 stars.",3
"It always seems to not  be able to connect to server. It's really annoying.  I have a sgs4 so it can't be my phone, and I have great wifi and I've also tried it with my 4g lte but no luck. Can you please fix this.",4
"Leave it to EA to take a great classic game and turn it into a vapid lumbering husk that screams Feed Me Microtransactions!  Not only did I uninstall the game, I'm also steering clear of owning their stock.  They're doing it wrong.  Very wrong.",1
So far so good,5
,5
,5
"I believe the game play is wonderful.  The problem that I am encountering is that I am unable to play at times when I have purchased an ability and then the server will not allow me to connect to their server for hours.  This to me is  stealing my money.  I would have expected this from a developer that is not so well known like EA.  My recommendation is that you not spend any of your own personal money to better yourself in this game as I frequently encounter connectivity issues (I have used 4 different network connections to attempt resolution) and I am unable to play as the game is intended.  Due to the connection issues, I have to give this 1 star.    If you want to talk to EA about this game, good luck,  its impossible,  Try for yourself, you'll see that there are a lot of ""hoops"" involved to contact them.  Its not as simple as they put it in their auto-reply e-mail to you.",1
,4
Gem mechanism doesn't reduce the stars still great gaming. Although $99.99 for 14000 gems is crazy.,5
Good graphic s good game,5
Can't progress without buying gems ..... used to love this game on computer but it has been ruined! Don't waste your time,2
"Was a fun game on PC, long ago, until EA stepped in and turned it into a money pit. It really seems EA has a gift for taking quality entertainment and turning it into something unusable unless you spend hundreds of dollars on it...  Good job EA, way to narrow down the good game playing field... A few more games from you guys and the world can go back to reading the writing on bathroom stalls...",1
This game has the best graphics ever seen on a app game.,5
"This game is a good time filler, simple and fun. I don't have to invset too much and I don't get penalties for not visiting every day.  Pretty cool.",4
"Fun and thinKing strategy all in one. Could cut leveling up times down a bit, but otherwise very entertaiNing.",5
"This app, while it can barely hold a candle to the original DK, is entertaining enough to keep you coming back week after week, if only to see what else is in store.  The game is not fast by any means, and the attempts to profit by micro transaction are blatant, but there is enough of the original humor to satisfy the true fans.",3
Try it!,5
"This is the type of defense game I was waiting for! One were you can attack and defend, destroy defenses, and protect your defenses from destruction. I am currently having problems as I cannot connect to the server after connecting the game to Facebook. Admins help!!!",5
Can't even connect to server,1
Just as good as impite but more streamlined and user. Friendly,5
I loved the original game and was excited when I found about the game app. However I never got a chance to play because the game repeatedly crashes on me. My phone is brand new with lots of space available so I know the problem is not on my end. Please fix!,1
Great game,4
Nothing like dungeon keeper. Yet another micro transaction fueled game designed to frustrate players into paying to win. Shameful. Needs Internet access to play? Retarded. Can't even open it now without giving EA access to steal my Google+ profile info and spam my friends?,1
"the gameplay, graphics, ect...",5
Pricing is a bit high but you have plenty of options to get free imps. Just mine it,5
,3
I like this game,5
Great,5
Love this game. Played the original and have been addicted ever since. Haha,5
I love this game,5
I crack up every time,5
"Dungeon Keeper is pretty blatently trying to compete with Clash of Clans, though the dungeon part allows for more strategy in design and the spells add more interactivity. The microtrasactions are deplorable with 4-24 hour waits for single blocks and blatent pay to win boosts including DK Premium. It insults the franchise it was given with these blatent get rich quick schemes. It's ok if you ignore that fact.",3
Fun game. Almost like a TD game but dungeons,4
,5
,4
"Great game refreshing concept, little to no purchase requirements which again is very refreshing",5
Wooooooooooo,5
"Not as bad as everyone says, especially when compared to other higher end app games. Just keeps getting better!",4
It a good game for my son and I play it also,5
"Decent game, really enjoyable. Cool type of gameplay. Loading sucks and takes forever but other than that. Great game.",4
,1
It's not the original game but it's good for mobile,4
Ok,3
Awesome,5
Imps are way expensive. They should make them cheaper up in game content unlock able,4
You won't get my money,1
"this is probably one of the best apps on the App Store. Its really fun, and you will enjoy it thoroughly. If you're into games like clash of clans then you will love this app.",5
Only way to enjoy the game is to pay a lot.,1
I love it,5
,5
Nice   le                  .,5
,5
Best Evil game I ever played since devil may cry 4,5
Unlike the original this is a good rts spin on the classic dungeon keeper 5 out of 5,5
"This game is fun, and the writers have put a lot of work into making the experience totally worth the time you put into it.",5
Need to make it so that the credit card warriors don't always win since they can just buy everything they need to win with real money hate when companies do This,3
,5
Very Addicting,5
Loved playing this as a kid!!!,5
It's a great and addicting game I love it I play it every day,5
There's a very good app,5
Pay to win and nagging notifications that can't be muted,1
Fun. Hard to select and drag items. Glitchy graphics. Might play better on a tablet or pad. I miss the old DK,3
Very interesting combo of an RTS and tower defense!,4
,5
,1
It good not that much dwell time,4
"One of the best games I've played on a phone / tablet! The waiting time and the cost required to bypass such are both excessive so it eventually becomes more of a background game. I wish I got to spend more time actually playing it. But slow as it is, it's still fun to see my dungeon grow. And to watch it hold off hoards of attackers!",5
,4
Would be a good game my my galaxy with wifi always looses connection won't spend a dine until its fixed,1
A nice remake of an old classic. Lots of fun.,5
The game with reward you for a 5 star review.   Just horrible.  I would gladly pay a 1 time $20 unlock to make the game play like the old version.  Rather than the pathetic Micro transaction hellscape it is now.  So sad.  I was so excited.    Dungeon Keeper is back... except EA is the Keeper.. and our Money is the plunder.  Shameful use of an amazing IP.,1
Great game Time burner,5
To much time to complete tasks,3
,5
,5
This game is horrid.,1
,5
,4
"This game is the kind of game you do a little bit then go do something else while it's working,  the people that are complaining about ""having to buy gems"" are just impatient and don't understand this kind of game,  if you play games like Clash of Clans this is kind of like that but with a twist.",5
Gr8,5
"It takes so much time to build and upgrade. At first, I really liked it. But after a long time of waiting, my interest is lost.",1
Tripie homie,5
"Unlike most people here, I never played this game on the computer. But man is this insane. Iv combed over hundreds of freemium games and never found anything that made me just laugh and quit on the first wait period (4 hours).  Whats going on Ea? You are always hit and missing with me when it comes to your games.",1
Like most mobile games this focuses on pay to win and pay to speed up too much.  I'd much rather have some banner ads or just pay outright for the whole game. Makes me want to go play the old dungeon keeper games again.,3
I like it,4
Awesome,5
,5
"The single biggest thing I wish EA had added to this game? Good guys, what our dungeons were once created for. There's nothing quite like seeing a team of heroes learn just how deep they've really gone.   The thing I wish they'd left out? Clash of Clans. Cooperation between Keepers? Really? Although Richard Ridings is a delight, Horny would laugh at the very idea.  You mixed a little dungeon keeper flavor in a big pot of clash of clans and added in. A heaping portion of make EA money, and that's sad.",3
"I love this game, it doesn't get old. If you want to play for long periods of time in one sitting however,  you have to fork over the dough to replace coins that rejuvenate over time. So I play for 10-15 minutes at a time and you play again later that day and voila! You're rich again.  Worth the waiting. Like I said quite addicting.",5
Awesome game love it 5 stars,5
I've waited three and a half days the money I spent on the Diamonds unacceptable game,1
Expensive and very time consuming to play though,4
Good app,5
Ordinal was so fun,5
horrible connection issues every now and then it disconnects alot need to fix this issue.not pleased because of it.uninstalling it.,1
,5
I am enjoying it so far.,1
But this app is crash happy.,4
Yaya it's cool.,4
"All 1-4 star reviews you do in game don't get posted to the market place, make sure to come back and post your opinion here.",1
Wish you could get more minions without spending 800 gems though,4
"Gameplay starts off slow but picks up once u build a head of steam. Neat concept and interrelated play aspects. Olverlord meets medieval Sims. I love smacking Imps! Gems are very pricey and upgrades take a long time in free play. interactive wallpaper download has ""parsing error"" great over all!",4
This is by far the greatest defensive game I have had the pleasure of playing! I can't wait for more monsters and spells to be added.,5
Best action game since clash of clans. A new way to conquer the cloud.,5
I play games on my phone to pass time here and there. My dungeon is often attacked while I'm sleeping or at work. I won't build the guild lair because I don't need access to the forums. I should be able to opt out of PVP and just enjoy the game in solo play.,2
This is not a fun game at all. But more importantly EA manipulates the rating system in this game by asking users if they want give this app a 5-star rating and redirects the user to the Google play rating page. If the user clicks the below 1-4 star rating they are taken to a different page. All of this is done to filter out lower rating for this lackluster game.,1
"Very fun game , awesome graphics for a tablet game. Really cool system for upgrades, and its free!!!",3
Pretty fun. Passes the time we'll during the day.,5
This is a great tower defence game. I love it and I recommend you guys should play this,5
,4
,5
"I get on it few times a day along with some other games I play that are kind of like this. Gems are hard to get but its still fun raiding and buidling up the dungeon,oh and slapping the imps.",4
Good,5
I like it enough but the old computer game was better. This app feels like it takes too long to progress in.,3
Very good and funny,5
Would be better if a one time purchase unlocked all rooms and minions. Without spending tons of gems which you basically have to buy the game takes a very long time to upgrade and play.,3
Good game kinda needy but when you have the time its fun,4
,4
It'll do for now,4
A really fun game but...It has now crashed on me 3 times in the middle of a battle. I lose creatures and have to spend gold that I don't get in the battle to get new creatures. Fix please.,2
Cool game. Time consuming.,3
"The folks upset with the microtransactions are not playing the game at the intended free to play pacing. It is slow, not intended for extended game play. A few minutes here or there to win.",4
"Ok so get ready for lots of waiting or spend a huge amount of money. Biggest ripoff on thr android market. Play till your coins run out then uninstall. Biggest joke of a ""game"" ive ever seen. Imagine this without any of the time delays and its awesome.",1
,4
"This is an awesome app, and although it fails sometimes, th e fair starting gems and awesome campaign and raiding makes up for it.",5
I love this app takes a bit to get things going and not the same format as the originals but I like the game play and seeing the characters again.,5
"Awesome game , super fun to play",5
Fun,5
Great time waster. You can easily micro manage or focus only on the big picture. Great job.,5
,4
"This is not a game. Games are suppose to be fun, entertaining,  and challenging. This is a peace of crap that just wants you to shove money into your phone. EA seems to like f*** up good games.",1
"Good lil time killer, play at or own pace, more often u go n collect or resources, faster it goes",5
,1
Although after the last update I lost my dungeon...  And even though it's no dk! It's a pretty decent Game.  Just wish there was a way to earn gems faster..  I spent so long clearing my dungeon with only two imps last dungeon...  Would give a better review if This was fixed and maybe n option to increase imp work speed to say 3x speed...  You know for those of boring trips and stops at the doctors,3
Lovin it,5
A good Keeper would never love anything.,5
,5
I enjoy this game,5
"Outstanding.  The cutest, coolest and most unique game I've ever seen. And I've seen them all! I'm hooked already.",5
This must be what microtransaction hell is like.,1
,4
,5
Awesome game just make it stop halving to reload every time I go to another thing and come back and also as some one already said put in way to in lock imps or at least better ways to get gems I mean its called a gem vain but as far as I can tell you do not always get gems and why dose dig time go from 3 secs to 4 hours that's a huge change and why are the other mines so far it could take a month to reach one and why is the every imp quest only give 40 gems it is very hard to get because you have to sit and wait of use many gems but enough bad it is still fun building up a doungen defending it  although the question remains why do killed chickens turn in to broken eggs over all fix some of these fails and make the guild list by what they have point and trophy wise not order of entrance so keep improving and you may have a great game,4
"Can't remember the last time I gave a 5 star rating. Good job EA. I don't know why people are complaining about the gems, you're not supposed to have super base the first five minutes of gameplay people!!!",5
,2
I recommend this game only if you have five minutes a day to play it,3
Really good,5
Great game,4
Couldn't get past naming my dungeon because the key board for it refused to come up. If the creators actually read this then fix it and then ill try again maybe ill even rate it better,1
"EA thought they could make a game that could compete with Clash of Clans, but they did not. Poorly made game.",1
"I count myself a die-hard fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games. I am pleasantly surprised at how good this reboot of the game is.  It is not a direct port if the game from PC to mobile, but it's graphics are great, the game play is very similar and the basic premise is the same. Basically it has the same look and feel with better graphics and you can play others now instead of just the computer (which is also still possible, just without the storyline).  Highly recommend this game, hours of fun!",5
Awsome game,5
The game has many transactions that get in the way of the fun,3
Cool,5
More stuff for me please,4
I find this game to be fun beacause you can find gems in any of the rock but it takes far too long to break the outer stone.,5
,5
,5
Awsome,4
Hdhdhhd,5
"I like the game play, but time restrictions make this difficult to play and gems are too pricey to purchase to speed game play...",4
"Expensive as hell, if you actually like to play a game, and actually *do* stuff.",1
Very gud game,5
,4
Its a great game but for some reason I can no longer play,3
Lots of fun.,4
Good game,5
,3

,4
Good game,5
"Sweet game, a must try !",4
I recomended,4
Would definitely recommend to a friend,5
.Blast friend and foe alike as you rise to the top villain in the world...Awesome!!! Loved the old PC games the android version is just as fun,5
"I like the game ,I play it evry day but the event raids are a bit to hard for people that aren't high level",4
,5
I'd give it more stars if I could,5
a couple weak items and some sporadic data loss or this would have five stars. good to kill time,4
,5
,5
"It's dungeon evil. But don't look for the original game here. Humans don't come for you, you can't corrupt nice and good places and game is very stingy with imps and time. It's supposed to make you want to buy gems, but all I want to do is quit playing when it's taking hours for your two imps to complete anything. But, you do have monsters, and can attack other dungeons, and sound effects are the same. Plays flawlessly on my HTC one android. But everything does.",3
,5
"Really cool game and easy to play. The concept is unusual, the graphics are cool and the game play is awesome. Highly recommended!",5
You do NOT have to spend  money. I played the ORIGINAL and this game is WAY better! People just like to complain. Don't listen to angry TROLLS. Some people are never happy. Thank you again EA.. I am a truly satisfied customer!,5
Its above the rest of the other games but very vile,4
I love slapping my imps around. Makes them work harder,5
Awesome game,5
Cant get enough vary addictive game,5
"I just don't like that you have to buy gems, that worst part and achievements offer so little",5
Killing time,4
,4
Love it I can't stop playing it,5
I enjoy playing this game.  The graphics are nice and the gameplay is challenging and entertaining!  Five stars all the way!,5
I loved this game as a computer game. As an app it has only improved,5
It's fun,5
"Awesome fun, takes awhile to get workers but still a great game.",5
Great game just don't want to spend money like everyone else,4
Fun way to kill time,4
Its good...I like the workshop,5
,5
Great way to kill some time lol,4
Before the update it would get to 90% ulnary minions now it doesn't even get to there it was crashes right away and I really wanna try this game so fix this please,1
EA trying to make money.,1
OK,5
Very awesome but needs to be able to spawn emps like original,5
It's fun if you get a guild together. Look for The Sickest Guild.,4
"Love playing it,very unique....",5
Gd game,3
Amazing game easy to play  but hard to control,5
Really I could bairly get in to the game! Then wait 5h then 10h now give us your cash! Thats how it is for me.,1
Could play it for hours,5
"Could be a bit easier to gather resources but other than that, fairly simple and straight forward game",4
EA/Mythics run at a f2p model is geared heavily toward pay to play with multi day upgrade times its a test of patience and abrogation.,3
,5
Wow,5
Tower defense and base game all in one,5
And really thrilling,5
Good job,5
,5
Great game!,5

I still own the original dungeon keeper for pc. Almost as much fun,4
,5
"The game is good but you need speend money in order to go faster otherwise you need speend a lot of time, another think is you lose all your creatures when you deploy then, even if they don't die",3
To bad so many micro transactions,4
"Fun game, but unlocking imps needs to be cheaper, imo... Otherwise,  a very enjoyable game!",3
"Would been 5 if it wasn't so expensive to play, building is to long",4
I enjoy playing this game,5
Way too slow to get gems without buying them,4
,5
Buy it,5
,4
"First, they've made this game so dependent on an internet connection (which prevents cheating), that it's nearly unplayable without standing still where you have good signal. Add to that the fact that they've turned something as awesome as Dungeon Keeper into a ""farming"" game... *sigh*",2
But I wish it more like the desktop version,4
Awesome game,5
Like this game.I play this game everyday for the whole day.but it always say reconnecting every minute,5
They sure do want you to spend money on it,4
"Loved this game back in the day, love it just as much now. Great app. No complaints at all.",5
But i like PC better,5
Although having to wait is cheap and lame playing this game brings back old memories well done,4
"Great game, love the concept, but upgrades get VERY pricey...VERY fast. But that's literally my only complaint! Keep up the good work!",4
"If you want to do a free to play game,  there are better ways to do it such as loadout and plants vs zombies.  And don't do this on a classic franchise.",1

"24 hours to dig out tiles unless you pay about $3? About $40 to buy imp 6 (unless you play for free for years and earn a few gems at a Time)? Another fine example if EA being greedy and screwing up a good franchise.  Make this a standalone game for $9.95 and I might buy it but this ""free to pay micro transaction pay for everything or wait forever"" approach is a joke.",1
Good game,5
Only wish it didn't take so long to dig,5
N.a.,5
Cool,5
To EA: please fire the DK developer who writes the code for network connections and borrow the guy who writes the code for Sims Freeplay because that game doesn't skip a beat.  The Reconnecting problems that have plagued DK are so frustrating that I want to pull my hair out! This has been like this for a year now. Ridiculous . I can't even submit a bug report for about a year now because of the keyboard issue too.  Can't type in any text field in this game. Brutal.,1
I want to be a keeper,5
,5
Great game,4
,4
Very enjoyable,5
This is an insulting translation of the original. It appears to be a re skin of clash of clans without any of the game play elements of the DK franchise. Read the gaming mags and blogs. This is the quintessential example of why the freemium/whale-hunting phenomenon is ruining gaming.,1
,5
"Not a bad game. Typical build a base and conquer others for resources. Moving buildings needs work, it's frustrating to get a grip sometimes.",3
"Not what I was thinkn, yet. Hoping it gets better.  I'd like it a bit more like the original.",4
Lots of fun!,5
Overall gameplay has been fun slow going n not very demanding of time. a Bit kiddy and not much like the original but still a decent time sink,4
Not bad just started,5
A nostalgic trip for someone who has played the original PC game,5
:-)  :-)  :-)  :-)   :-),5
,5
Fun to play,5
,5
Little too long in build for continuous play,4
Great game. Just wish I could que up tasks. Random hero attacks like the previous dks would be an awesome touch too.,4
E,4
"Really boring and the notifications like alarm every 10 minutes skiing you to come back play are annoying. I didn't find a way to disable them. I don't really want to sit in class and hear randomly ""your minions are ready for battle""... Anyway they took a nice franchise and made a quality boring game out of something that was awesome. Now after the last update it crash after any raid or preview.",1
Its good to be bad :-),5

How about some way the guild can attack another keeper as revenge for attacking a guild member.,5

Games is lots of fun,5
So fun,5
Fun. Addictive. Everything I loved about the original DK.,5

"This game defines everything wrong with the pay-to-win micro transaction game style. It is impossible to design a defensible dungeon without crippling your resource production, meaning you will need to spend even more cash just to make any progress. Spare yourself the headache, unless you're willing to drop a few hundred dollars on this game.",1
Everything costs way too much and takes too many resources. It takes DAYS to build. !! This is done to get you to buy gems to speed things up. A good game but I would rather pay up front for it that suffer through the slow build. & I will not waste hundreds of dollars on this!,2
It`s keen.,4
"When I saw the Dungeon Keeper name,  I got excited.   However,  it turns out that it is yet another build for days clone.  The costs of gems is higher than other games.   Forget about controlling your troops in battle.  Storage space for the about of troops is no good.   There are no options for decent air defense until level 8.  All in all,  stock to clash of clans.   I really wish that someone would come out with an honest RTS LIKE THE ORIGINAL DUNGEON KEEPER.",2
Works well with good RTS features you can do at your own pace.,5
Resources are tight and the tutorial is a little tedious but I am having fun with the game,4
From totalbiscuits video I do see how its a bad ripoff of thr old game but its ok from a mobile standpoint,4
Keep up the good work.,5
,1
"Love the game, deciced to buy some gems....nothing happened.  Now it says ""please wait for previous transaction to complete""  please fix this issue, I do like this game, but I want what I paid for :(  Only reason for four stars.",4
"Not as good as the original for the PC, but it's not bad for a phone app...",3
Great concept. Seems challenging so far.,5
I just do,5
Great game and loads of fun but it takes awhile to do anything and to speed the process the gems are just too expensive.,5
"Just love it, keep it up HORNY!",5
"Despite the absurd costs to speed things up and get imps, I find that my busy lifestyle fits the game. Start building, wander away for awhile. It isn't for the impatient player for sure. Still, I wander back often just to slap imps and make them dig more.",4
Great graphics and game play enjoyable. The userous cost of gems makes it slow going. One either spends money or waits days to get things constructed. It would have been much better if EA charged a nominal fee.,3
,5

,5
brings back memories,5
I game won't let me play it was fine at first now I can only play for about 1 min then quits if I can even get on the game in the first place,4
Detracts from the old school Dungeon Keeper feel with all the push to get you to make in app purchases. Otherwise great game,3
installed in less that 30 because this interrupted my game -_-,1
Takes me back to computer games as a kid.,5
,5
They took a classic great game and made it into a dull slow tedious bore. It crashes a lot too.,1
Yep... There goes my freetime,5
"Fun, but dear god do they really make you spend money if you don't want to wait weeks to progress. The gem packs are way over priced, and the costs of ""speeding up"" production or anything else that uses gems is totally unreasonable. If they get a handle on that at can balance it, they may be on to something here. I use gems because I'm a big boy gamer that plays multiple times a day every day. Not a once a day if I remember sort of guy.",3
Mircotransactions galore,1
,5
,5
Brings back old memories,4
I put a lot of time into this game. Enough to know that paying gives you an undeniable and unbeatable advantage.,1
"This game is the epitome of what the gaming industry is doing wrong. Please just start making $30 games again that are whole and don't make me wait 3 years to do anything.   I played for two days before quitting, and if you are reading this don't waste your time.",1
Not bad at all. .. Now all we need is the second part to DK..DK2 mobile,4
"So far looks very promising, can't wait to see what else is in store :)",5

This game is amazing,5

,4
Love it!,5
"I had no idea what this game was then i saw Dan Bull sing the song about this game and I thought it was awesome! It plays so smoothly and the gaming mechanics rock! I give it 5 stars because this game makes me ""horny"" to raid dungeons!!!",5
"I refuse to play a game that makes me buy play time. I don't know how this kind of thing got started, but it is only perpetuated by people supporting it. I have hopes that sooner or later people will wise up, but I think I give too much credit.",1
"I thought this game would be fast paced and exciting like Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 for the PC.   Well, I was very wrong.  Progress crawl by at a snail's pace and upgrading anything takes forever, or more gems than you really have to spare, especially if you want more imps to upgrade things (those little suckers are expensive!)  If you have the patience to play this game for a few weeks in a row, checking back on it every three to four hours, not doing much of anything else in between (yes, raiding other keepers' dungeons gets very VERY boring after a while), then maybe you can get a leg up in the game, but as for me, I am almost ready to uninstall it.",2
Love this game!!,4
I get to waste time like no other,5
I want to play not pay 100 dollars per level. Garbage.,1
Great game. Tutorial is incomplete.,4
Good time killer,4
"Definitely has a similar feel to original. Endless bottlenecks annoying, but still quite fun despite it. Being able to fill rock and move rooms on a whim is useful",3
Good game as a whole and buying doesn't appear to necessary. It just save s a load of time and lets you get to the fun in the game.,4
,5
,4
Very Fun love how the devil dude randomly comments,5
Nothing like dungeon Keeper from childhood. Really just another tap game that's pretty hard not spending money.,3
I love it,5
Just like the computer game,5
"Seemed way cool & heard good things about the original, but too difficult to figure out and get resources, etc. without paying. 8(",4
Crashes when on imp loading screen,2

They brought back an old in a new way,5
Awesome,5
"I'm not one of the original Keeper players, but I can understand their frustration. I love the idea but the payment and timing structures are way off. These pay-when-it-gets-too-hard just a little too quick games are betraying the gamers who want to be playing these games anyways. It also rewards people with cash to blow by immediately sending them to the head of the pack. I'll keep playing but EA, certainly you have better profit models lying around.",3
This app is ok.,2
Quickly ran out of stuff to do,2
"This game is awesome, but not everyone has constant internet connectivity. I need to be able to play while on an upcoming flight!",3
"Amusing tower defense/dungeon building game. Takes a bit of patience if you want to get through the game without spending lots of money, but that doesn't detract from the fun factor, just adds suspense and a greater feeling of reward when you finish buildings and such.",5
Enjoying but typical pay to win,5
I am having fun playing this,5
You play 2 seconds and have to wait hours for anotyher 2 seconds of play. A really crappy way to play. Purely stupid.,2
love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       l,5

Its amazing,5
"I'd love to review this game...unfortunately all I can review is the tech support (nonexistent for this game) since all I get while trying to access game is ""can not connect"".",1
,5
I just love this game. I'm not one for these types of games but this one got me hooked... fun game!,5
"I've been playing this game for about 2 weeks now and it's getting to a point where you're going to hate yourself if you don't buy any gems for at least $50. I'm a huge fan of the original dungeon keeper but this is just getting painful to play. Where in the original was like the more you played it the more you liked it. I don't hate the Android version of it, it's a nice money making game but they shouldn't have called it Dungeon Keeper. And for doing so... It gets 2 stars... btw, guild search sucks.",2
Cool game,5
,5
Very fun. Sometimes loads wrong.,4
Vary kool game .,4
"If you are unfamiliar with the game & make a few bad choices in the beginning, you can't reset it. You're stuck with a crappy dungeon forever.",1
,5
,5
Fun game. Nice not having to buy your way up.,5
,5
Fun.,5
"EA muffed some things up, per usual, but overall im happy with the experience so far.",4
This game does have potential but you guys really need to rework the dig and construct times. I should not need to buy 10 dollars worth of crap just to build one room with in an hour.,1
,5
,4
"I expected to find the old dungeon keeper game from the old days, complete disappointment. If I could un-pay for this I would.",1
Cool,3
"Love the game, but force closes, disconnects while  raiding, and constantly has to reconnect.  Please help devs!  I love this game when it works!!",3
,5
The PC game as an App. Works for me! Using a Samsung S2X and no problems here.,4
In order to update your storages to level 3 you need to upgrade your heart to level 3... the problem is that stone storage is 6K and you need 6.5K to upgrade the heart... so you are on a dead end and no way to contact EA,1
I have been playing this almost a month and lately I wait a whole day to dig a out a section of dungeon only to when it is almost done I have to start a ll over as if I never started.  Download only if you like bad software and frustration.,2
,4
It definitely is a good time sink and funny too.,4
Best game ever,5

Fun enjoyable strategy game.,4

"EA succeeds in ruining another storied game. By now you should all know the basics - free to download, but you'll need real world money to make significant progress.",1
Loved it on the PC years ago and love it on the mobiles now!,5
Great graphics,5
It may be tempting to spend money on this game but it is fully possible to have a great dungeon and spend ZILCH. You must have patience young padawan.,5
BEST...GAME...EVER!,5
Im the queen this game,5

"You dont even get through the tutorial before they encourage you to spend the $ currency. If you dont use the currency, the game takes painful amounts of time to do even the simplest action like digging out 1 block.  The game plays very little like the original dungeon keepers and I dont understand how its gotten so many 5 star ratings.  It also forces you to accept some kind of online agreement before continuing past the tutorial, which I promptly denied, and as a result it locked up my tablet.   **UPDATE**   The reason the game has so many 5 star ratings is because the games internal rating system forces you to give a 5 star rating or no rating at all and due to lazy people, they dont bother to come back to the google store to give it a proper unrestricted rating. **UPDATE**",1
,5
"Too much pay benefits, but a fun game if you remember the original",3
Fun to build your dungeon and adjust to counter WEAKNESSES.,4
Good times I say,5
"Much better than clash of clans, or jungle heat, or battle beach, or greed for glory.",5
This game is addicting and a great time waster. Horny is freaking awesome in this game. His voice actor is top notch. It plays like a tower defense and attack game.,5
Would be better if I could play the same game in progress across platforms between an iPhone and an android tablet.,3
Controlling monsters and defending your dungeon.  A lot of fun.,5
,3

Reminds me of the old PC game.,5
Fun game,5
Good game but i wish it didnt take forever to get things done without buying gems,4

"Great graphics engine, typical for EA mobile game I play.  Was hoping for more old style freedom of the original game.  Not happy with the Gem Market, Alerts on work to be done, or having to wait progressively longer periods (days?) For some upgrades on a personal dungeon.  Hope to see improvements in freedom game play options.",4

Like the original on xbox. Fun time consumer,5
this game can't move fast enough.  :-)   I love it,5

Very addictive with some amazing graphics. The combat system is well thought out and balanced.,5
,4
Asome and epic,5
Good game to pass the time. Pretty interesting and semi strategic!,4
Load times suck but in game features are nice.,4
Its alright I am getting to like bits of the New game it is ok,3
It takes forever to accomplish anything later in the game.  I understand the concept of in app purchases but I would much rather spend $5 $10 out right to avoid the frustration.,4
"I used to play this on pc so I was looking forward to this. However it takes forever to save up gems for imps which makes building and expanding really slow. The worst problem is actually getting the game to work in the first place. It freezes and will dump you out in mid-raid and then I have to manually force close and clear cache to get back in ... that is if it will let me back in. Imp problems seemed fixed after last update, but now the freeze & dump seems worse. No way I'll spend money on this atm.",2

Should lower the rate of which things are created. Won't even let me get into the game to play do to an error loading  updates. Fixed after reinstalling.,3

If you like interesting games you should get this,5
I remember playing this game back when I was a kid on the computer. Now its even better that I can play on my phone. The only downfall is how much it cost for the gems.,4
Kinda fun like the game to bad ea is a greedy douche,3
"Strategy based game play, great graphics, having Dan Bull on the theme song was an added bonus and the fact you can turn the push notifications on/off makes this game an excellent casual gaming experience.",5
This app is super addicting and quite fun to pass time anywhere.,5
"Once you get past the long wait times, this game stays true to the overall elements of the DK series. It's a fine game to play for a few minutes here and there throughout your day.",4
I love this game!,5

This is game is probably the worst hunk of crap on the android market. Can do nothi g without being asked to pay insane cash shop prices. Save your time and money and let this die. Dont help fund games that screw gamers like this one.,1
Most appalling use of IAP cancer I've ever seen. This game is seriously worse than candy crush. You developers building a game from the ground up with microtransactions in mind are killing gaming. As a huge fan of the original dungeon keeper series I was more than disappointed by this garbage. Pass this one up everyone.,1
Fun and challenging üòÅ,5
,5
I'm still getting into it. Can't do much for long periods right now but it is fun so far. I'm a fan of the past DK games and this one feels like a Dungeon Keeper game with some differences.,3
"Forces you to rate a five unless you want to jump through hoops, and then tries to rob you blind the first and every chance it gets.   Within the first 60 seconds of playing you'll be forced to spend 100 gems. It does not get any worse than this. Yet another EA fail.",1
Love playing this,5
,5
Hell yea!,5
,4
Join a guild!,5
It is Yummy,4
Good game,4
"Nice try EA... so much better off playing clash! In an age of in app purchasing games I never seen one so blunt. Tasteless and not playable without purchases. Start off a game play with 24 hour waits... and the game itself telling you to spend. EA is the B of A of gaming, stop being foolish people!",1
Seriously...slap the imps. Best part. You abuse and they work harder! If only real life was that easy.,4
Great strategy game...like a tower defense game. The dungeon humor is very comical. But the game does require a lot of patience....so be forewarned.,5
"Which is high praise for a game with this type of IAPs.  Usually I'd have dropped it, but it's balanced just right, so I don't have to dip into my wallet unless I'm feeling particularly impatient.  More importantly, it isn't in my face about making those purchases.",4
Sinister fun,5
,4
This is a great old school game revamped for touch screens. It even works well on my old tablet.,4
Fun,4
Few things should be lowered in pricing but overall very well constructed,4
"Most of the five star reviews are because they offered freemium currency for them. Do not be fooled. This game will take forever without paying big bucks and lacks charm  And look, I lost all of my progress and had to start over",1
"A bit extreme on dig and resource generation times starting off, but otherwise, decent gameplay",3
Awesome,5
Fun and addicting game to play.  Can't put it down,5
I love it,5
,5
i loved it,5
,3
Yeh what that said,4
Worth trying,4
Blah disappointing and saddening.  I would have paid 10 dollars just to play dungeon keeper 2 on my phone.  this is blah,2
It's just to bad gems cost so much,3
"This is a great game.  However I have a few dislikes, I dont like that after a raid u lose all your minions and have to rebuild them all and I dont like the fact that you cant earn gems faster",4
Better then clash of clans you get 6 builders twice the speed of building and easy gems.,5
..,4
Wish it was like the originals and all I had to do was pay one set price.,1
,5
,4
Amaz fun get it,5
,5
"Your supposed to get on to play a couple of minutes throughout the day not non - stop and once I got used to that I think it's great! I run my own business so I don't have time to play games for hours on end. Also your imps keep working while your away, so you just get on give'em a slap, then give them some instructions, collect your gold and stone, and log off again.  So basically I really like it. I like the original DK and DK 2 as well.",5
Cool game time consuming,5
,5
A nostalgic abomination,3
Good,5
,5
"Its a really fun game, but its a little over attached, its alright though. There still is a few downsides, but all in all its really fun.",4
I just wish they wouldn't have automatically started with give us money to update your imps of all things I do love the game though,4
Playable even if you dont want to buy,5
,5
Should be easier to get your 3rd imp imo.  So used to playing the desktop version a little distressed on how slow it is to get things to develop.  But for a phone app...   not bad at all.,4
,5
"Fun strategy build and conquer game. Some crass humor which I enjoy, typical of these games, to get anywhere you need to spend $ which is annoying. Overall a good game.",3
"Not the same as PC game, but soild.",5
Awesome,5
Awesome,5
Fun in the beginning but quickly transitions into another money sink pay to win game!,3
Joe I Uchida,5
I find this amusing.,3
,4
Its a good game few flaws just when trying to move items in the game and the whole map wants to move and the resources take forever to get with everything costing so much to update at such a low level but other then that good game to play in between castle clash,3
It's fun,4
,5
This game was awesome and I played it every day and all the sudden my game was erased. Wtf? :(,1
,5
F'ing disconnects!!!,1
Takes too long to get anything done. Gems are way too hard to come by.,3
I love this game,5
Would be better if I didn't disconnect and reconnect when on wifi during the middle of a raid with which it just counts you as defeated.... Fun.... Not,2
,5
"So much potential wasted! I thought a pocket version of Dungeon Keeper was better than none at all, but the slow grind and imbalance proved me wrong. Time to make my battery happy and uninstall.",2
"Kinda fun, time killer between other games.",3
Cool,5
Fun,5
,5
,4
Thanks for a fun game,5
,5
Totally addicted!!,5
think they should do something about the way the game refreshes after a disconnect. Not so fun.,2
"Does take awhile to do things in the game unless you're willing to make in-app purchase. That style of play works for me though, & it is free.",4
Been looking for a good game to mess with,4
Don't really need money to play,4
,5
Good game,5
Cool game,4
A fun game.,4
"They had to try hard to ruin such a great franchise, but they did it.",1
Yeah it's a pretty groovy game for the most part I'm not as good as the original with the technology that we have I think that they would have been able to basically transfer the original game on to this with just a slight update in the graphics and be able to have a very enjoyable revamp of the brand but I'm glad that they remembered Dungeon Keeper enuff to make a game out of it the classic Dungeon Keeper as far as this game is concerned it is a very straightforward a very interesting strategy game and its,3
The time hacks are annoying almost force you to buy gems but great game,4
Hours of fun. Things do not progress too fast. Can have for for months.,5
My dungeon is fresh,5
,5
"Takes a long time to get anywhere. Imps should be able to be bought with coins not gems, so you can get somewhere. Training is horribly expensive for quick deaths. It is not really like the original. Might have to uninstall it because after a month I'm still nowhere.",2
Really sad to say it as I was a HUGE fan if dungeon keeper games on the PC. This game is ok. Very slow pace with a huge defensive learning curve. The time it takes to have imps mine out a base that is actually capable of defending itself is too small vs when players can attack you. In addition gaining gems without having to buy them is insane. I have 2 imps and I've been trying to farm gems from mining for a 3rd. I still have 100 to go before I can afford a 3rd. This game defines pay to win atm.....,3
Keep up da good work,5
"Horrible, do not download.",1
,4
It might not be exactly like the original but it's still a great game.,5
"Huge fan of the original keeper games, but this game is the same boring and tired old format already used and abused by hundreds of android and ios games.  I'm tired of the rehash of the same game with different graphics.  This type of game ends up so mindless and repetitive with no real strategy, that it's easy to see that it is just a retread who's soul purpose is a grab for cash and not the great game it could have been.  It also sucks that it must be connected to the internet even to just check on imps",2
This is just like the pc version from years back but with updates. Well coded conversion for the tablet mobiles game,5
,5
"The only real fault of this game for me is the lack of ways to earn gems, unless you want to purchase them.",4
I just wish there were less in app purchases. It seems like even the most minor tasks require too much,3
Awsome,5
,5
fun,5
Great graphics and really nice smooth play. Very fun. I highly recommend this game.,5
Great game,5
Well balanced gameplay.  Downside is long load times.,4
This is a crappy copy of clash of clans with the good name of Dungeon Keeper.  You ruin the good name,1
"I have played, for free, a couple of weeks now. I like watching the replays of people attacking my Dungeon. I would like to stack the imps on tasks...2 imps on the same task would 1/2 the time, e.g. 1 imp is 8 hours, 2 imps is 4 hours, 3 imps is 2 hours....  Thanks!",4
I like the concept of the game but its difficult to customize your base with the limited room your given and I had a really hard time even trying to refill dirt where unwanted it when designing my dungeon. It also crashs a lot on my android. I really like the idea of the game though so i hope improvements are made to it,2
Much fun such dungeon all wow,5
The game logic is very cool and everything is on its place. Only problem was the new update that kept me out for a week. I couldnt install it.n I specially love the voice of the devil :-),4
Fun game but if my device is low on memory it locks it up,4
"At first this game seemed fun and playable, i like the strategy games but after a week or so you realize that one more worker imp costs you around 8 real dollars. Really you want 800 gems for imp 3 don't even want to know how much imp 4 through 6 cost. And those are just the workers, don't even try to speed up building or excavating after a week of playing. Before you get any decent buildings or characters you could easily spend 100 real dollars. Cmon EA i expect more from you.",1
,5
It does differ from the other games in the franchise but has familiar and nostalgic characters running amok.,4
,4
,5
EA ruined a classic game by having vicious monetization. You literally can't do anything or progress with out paying hordes of money.,1
"My only complaint is you spend 4 to 24 hours to dig a gem square and get 1 to 3 gems , also 800 gems for a third imp! But I still come back for more!",4
,5
Outstanding!!!,5
Constantly updating. Had 4 updates on 2/26/14 and now another update on 2/27! I don't need that kind of help in burning up my hard drive space. Uninstalling.,1
"Wtf!? I'm not one to do much reviewing on google play, but when something insults one of my all time favorite games as badly as this steaming pile of crap has, I feel the need to speak up. This thing doesn't even remotely come close to what dungeon keeper was. It's the same cookie cutter formula used in every facebook/mmorts out there. You have to buy gems with real money to speed up upgrades on buildings and all that other crap. If you're a fan of dungeon keeper, pass this by.",1
"Similar to clash of clans, but I feel it is better.",5
I enjoy this game!,4
,4
,4
I probably wouldn't play this version if I hadn't had the games (1 and 2) on PC years ago.  It takes too long to do anything but I do like that I have one dungeon and can fight real players this time around.,3
"Bone Thugs. Looking for active gamers to join a small, but active guild.",4

Refreshing experience,5

"I normally don't like tower defense games, but this is completely different from any I've tried in the past. I enjoy excavating and mining for resources to level up all my rooms and traps, and training my minions. I love slapping my imps! Omg it makes me smile every time. With instructions and guidance, and mockery from Horny, Tim Curry from Legend?, it's just an all around fun game.",5
Great,5
,5
Great game play and not to slow in developement.  Havent gotten to guild levels yet but excited.,5
"Besides the fact they want you to buy crap to get anywhere fast. It is fun ans reminds me of the original.  Whatever happened to purchasing a game,instead of paying a ton of Money constantly to play. That is a poor game model. Just saying.",5

"Pretty good for free. The gems are a pain, but it is what it is.",5
Fun but slow paced,5
love the good old days slapping imps,5
"This game has caught a lot of guff because it shares a name with an old and awesome pc game of the same name, and really if you wanna compare the two, this is awful, but only because of the mobile formula (pay to win, which really in this game the prices are so astronomical that even I can't bring myself to buy anything) if you don't try and compare them, and just play this for what it is, and if you have even a shred of self discipline and patience you don't need to spend money, its a fun little game.",5

Good game. Would be nice if player could start a new dungeon.,3
Keep updating can't get enough of the app,5

Awesome game really fun,5

"Fun to do between everyday tasks. Take a short break, slap some minions, order stuff around, go back to what you were doing.",5
Great timekilker,4

It very additive!,3
Reminds me of the windows game that won't work on Windows 7,5

:),5
Excellent game just wish upgrades were quicker!,5
"If you like paying games on their terms, at their times then this is the game for you. If, on the other hand, you want to play on your own schedule, stay far, far away.",1
,5
"Fine game, but needs to address the time/money issue. EA should halve the cost of gems . If you decide to play, purchase 2000+ gems (currently costs $20) and buy 2 imps right away.",4
Awsome,5
,5
It is a wonderful strategic game,5
,3
I enjoy this app but it is slow to be able to do anything.  You need to purchase gems with real money to be able to accomplish anything quickly or to be able to summon a third imp.  Wish you could put two imps on the same job to increase productivity and reduce construction times.  Background activity kills my battery life.   I really want to like this more.,2
P2w so bad nerdcubed for life,1
This is NOT Dungeon Keeper.  This is some sort of obscene raping of an honored innovator of an entire genre.  Peter Molynjeux should sue EA for defamation of Dungeon Keeper's legacy.  Avoid this time sink of a money grabber at all costs.  It's not a game.  It's a fire-and-forget resource gatherer.,1

Good job very fun,5
"Do not spend gems unless you intend to buy them with real money, gems are hard to find, save them for imps.",4
"Highly recommended. Join my clan ""Your Tears Are Tasty""!",5
Fun game time consuming but desent,3
I like the computer version better,4
Just as good as the pc,5
Captures the feel of the original pretty well.  Not bad for a micro-transaction game.,4
Not Bad,4
"This is a game for the extremely casual gamer. As in you're going to be playing for about five minutes every hour or two. They're definitely trying to lean on you to cough up a lot of bucks for gems, but if you can be extremely patient, the game is playable for free. Eventually you'll carve out a decent dungeon, but expect to get raided a LOT in the process.  Just make sure to hoard your gems for imps and don't squander them on fast builds.  You'll be needing imps more than anything else.",4
Good game. Gems may be bought to boost though..,5
I would enjoy this game more if it was more like the original. I hate the free to play but pay to actually have flexibility in the game.,2
,4
Lots of waiting.. and waiting.. if I want more imps I've got to pay or wait for probably months. I feel that I could actually buy a game and get more actual play time from it I could see where the game would be somewhat fun if it didn't take 24 or 48 hours to actually get a building upgraded or 24 hours to get just a tiny hallway built. I think this game could be a lot of fun if it didn't require gems to do just about everything in a timely manner,2
Would have been 5 stars with a more even skill progression.  But overall I love that I can play put it down and when I have a moment pick it right back up.,4
Nice game like clash of clans and tower defense mixed into 1 but already a DK fan so this is pretty good,5
There's way too much emphasis on trying to make a second Clash of Clans. Menus are confusing and so is the multi-player aspect.,1
Great game.  Addictive,5
"I remember when the original, and its sequal, came out. I loved both of them. The strategic planning and dark, but quirky, sense of humor was something I've been missing in recent years. No it's not 100% the same. But I'm loving it just as much. Bullfrog!",5
Evil is fun.,5
,4
Ok,5
A good game buried behind needlessly long build times and shameless microtransaction money-grabbing.,3
Fun,5
Buying gems becomes pretty much a must relatively quickly. But otherwise a very close rendition of the desktop game. wish imps were cheaper and able to be expendable fighters tho,3
Pretty cool game,5
"Yes that's right, it's only fun when you're absolutely bored out of your mind and have no other obligations, or when you're on the toilet.  However, without paying you won't want to play for more than 2 minutes at a time.  Shame on you EA.  At first I wasn't keen on trying this game due to all of the negative reviews...if I can't build a complete dungeon with all available rooms, traps, and monsters..AND/OR I find myself at a disadvantage due to not paying.. I will consider lowering the rating.  Having said that, the game is free to try.  I paid a lot more for the originals, so as long as it doesn't truly become a money making scheme it will get more stars, but never 5 unless they bring it to the desktop with original controls.",2
,5
Wish it was on PC,5
Like concept,4
Amazing graphics and fun,5
So far it's been a cool game. I just started so we'll see.,5
This game is a must have,5
This is a really awesome game I love it but not as much as dragons world but its so cool. By the way what does $&#%  mean.,5
"Great classic game, remade for tablets and phones.",5
,4
,3
I love this game a lot play it everyday strategy and Keep me from being bored,5
A little Grundy but it's ok,2
,3
"This is great! I've been waiting for this to happen, because it's a game I loved on PC way back when.",5
,5
,4
Strategic and goal oriented.,5
"This game is made well. It has some of that classic dungeon keeper flavor. Unfortunately it is a game focused on making money. It lacks the story and a fun campaign that the origional games held. It is also essentially a typical ""social gaming model""  that provides an opprotunity to slowly build/unlock dungeon rooms and test your tower defense/maze building skills against other players/monsters.  I wish they would have made a campaign based RTS game focused on the story and charged $5 for the app instead.",4
,5
"Been playing this game since it was on pc. Glad that its portable now with added features. Always a blast to play, addicting!",5
Takes too long to do anything. Imps cost too much.,3
"Yeah. DK. Wanted it on tablet for years and now that it's here, it ain't bad. Wish there was a quick way to see your summoned troop inventory. Main point- you do not have to spend anything but time to do well.",5
,5
Great quality game,5
I loved mythic's daoc so I to give this game a try. So far it's been quite amusing,5
I like it so far no glitches or problems,5
This game gives just as much  as it takes!!! In a good way!!! Love it very much. Please don't change!!!! Love that it gives gems too.... Thank you for an awesome game!!!,5
It is a good game. The reason for the two stars is it glitches and freezes up a lot.,2
The only hard part is if you don't pay for gems it slows the game down.  Other than that it is really fun.,4
"Very challenging and FUN imp Slapping. EA got a lot of things right in this game but there's still alot of room for improvement. The chat system is Horrible , the time to do anything unless you have 3 or better imps makes the game drag to the point were you might stop  playing. The achievement awards are par.   Building the dungeons  are very fun and watching the replays is even better when you see huge boulders clearing troops lol. Add more incentive to the game and I'd give it a 5 out of 5.",4
,3
Needs to have more oportunities to aquire gems,5
Love this game's sense of humor. A little twisted but a great game's def worth the install. Have fun :-),4
Great game,5
Awesome,5
"Bit of a grind, worry about the end game but so far so fun",4
,5
Very fun line the way you can customize your dungeon. His twist on similar games,5
However wish you could design and give them attributes. Lol besides that whatever,4
"It plays decently, but progress is very slow if you don't pay real money for things. Additionally, about every third attempt to load the game causes the screen to flicker and fail to load. Okay game, but definitely not worth paying money for/on.",3
It has a nice PvP raiding dungeon raids takes some time to upgrade to a good dungeon,5
But the gems ...,3
"This game offers plenty of customization in your dungeons, a fun atmosphere and even manages to have the pay wall be completely reasonable. I can do everything without even using the gems. And if I want gems I can earn them in game at a rate that does make it possible to use them a few times. The small size of my dungeon, and the locked location of my heart and entrances are the only things keeping this from being a 5 star game IMHO. Great work to the people who made this.",4
"If you playec the classic, or are new to the game, its all win. Good job. Balanced gameplay. Addictive, solid, and fun.",5
This android version of DK is a bit different than the PC version I know and love but I think this game is still great and it definitely is addictive,4
Fair game but it is a weak shadow of the fun and humor of the original. The click and wait for 12 Hours pattern of play gets pretty tiresome. The dungeons are much more simple and not very customizable. The campaign is repetitive and the P vs P is not very interactive.,2
Great reboot of a classic game from the PC age the voiceover is excellent,5
"It reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper, though a lot has changed. I enjoy this version, it just has the same problem as most games with premium currency; if you play free, progress gets slow too fast. The achievements give tiny amounts of gems, but even the boosts cost a lot, and the cost for more imps increases drastically.  Beside that though, I love how the raiding and spells work, it's a very fun game.",5
Good job,5
Gems are too hard to get.  Game wants you to spend money.  No thanks.,4
I love the dungeon keeper series so I had to get this. I just think that not everything needs a cool down and it makes me miss the real dungeon keeper games.,3
,5
My biggest knock on similar games has been the player v player part. This game allows an element of strategy and depth. Its not enough to just throw money at it. You have to use some brains. Absolutely love it.,5
,5
It's the average waiting to build things app but it has a good time in between each interaction and more little things you can do at all times so you always have something you can do in the app if you play it right.,5
,1
"I read some pretty harsh reviews before I installed this app and I had previously played the Facebook version and didn't like it very much. So, I went into this expecting not to like it. I am very happy to report that this game is a lot of fun and kind of addictive. They play is pretty well balanced -- either that or the bad reviews scared off all the a**hole rape and pillage players. With just a little time each day I have been able to build up a nice little dungeon. I like how even in defeat I am not completely knocked back into the stone age. The game is simple enough to play that even I can win occasionally.   My recommendation is don't go into this expecting some epic over-the-top experience and just have fun.",4
I like that I can play a little at a time.,5
"Kind of really stupid... Either u shell out a ton of cash... Or wait, wait, wait and then wait some more... Concept is nice... But overall with all the paying or waiting... Kills the game... Cmon EA u make enough money to at least lighten up the load on pay to play....",2
,5
,2
Just AWESOME,5
Worthy successor to pc version.  Enjoyable time waster.,5
"Brings back memories of the old days of pc gaming! It's a bit demanding on your time and the microtransactions are too expensive, but it's a lot of fun for the patient.",4
"But it doesn't deserve to be called Dungeon Keeper. Bullfrog made a really great game that glorified in pure evil -- EA dumbed it down and made their version cute. Its fun, but it falls really short of the awesomeness of Bullfrog's DK.   Also it occasionally crashes my entire tablet... It's a Nexus 10, it can handle this game no problem, idk why it sometimes crashes while playing this...   There are a few things EA can do to make this game much more enjoyable: 1, make it dark and evil like DK is supposed to be, no more of this cute crap; 2, give Horny a greater variety of things to say -- I had to turn Horny's voice off after the first couple days playing cuz he just says the same things over and over.  Like I said, it's decent, but doesn't deserve to be called Dungeon Keeper.",3
,4

Epic!!!!,5
Game is great.  Plays flawlessly.  But you can play the game one of two ways... 5 minutes every other day... or pay over and over for gems to speed the game along as you develop.  It is complete bs.  COMPLETE BS.  Let me buy the game and play it on my own terms.  Make it $25...make it $45.  But this constant pay to play style game is nothing but corporate greed effecting my recreation time.,1
,5
i like,4
Spend a couples hours a day upgrading and maintaining my dungeon,4
Grate game just aome times takes minions a whole day to dig other than that love best free game ever,5
Awsome,5
"It's a sad attempt at being a classically amazing game that it will NEVER live up to. Imps take WAY too long to do their tasks, getting creatures is disgustingly difficult, and play progress is pathetically slow at best. I was really excited to try the game, but it's one big let down.",1
Too much encouragement to buy gems.,3
Building the perfect dungeon is very fun. Frustration comes learning where to touch certain items to move them around and some glitches with loading and some other minor bugs that occasionally pop up like not monitoring where imps are building or digging but this can all be resolved with a simple reload. Not as polished as COC but very unique and defending your dungeon is alot of fun too. Campaign is alot more varied and enjoyable than games like COC and others in the genre.,4
,4
I think it's a good game but I am tired of these games that are like when I'm not on my kingdom gets attacked. That's really stupid. Thieves stealing your gold and stones. That's pathetic.,3
Its awesome,5
Cool,5
Great game,5
Kool,5
Keeps me interested,5
,5
"While it doesn't match the old pc versions in terms of how much I love it, it is definitely one of my favorite app games!",4
"A fun sim, not unlike the earlier PC game. UI is overly picky at times, such as when placing or moving traps -- I have to attempt to drag 8-9 times before it accepts that I'm trying to MOVE THE TRAP -- otherwise lots of simple fun.",4
Slow game unless you spend the cash,2
Its ok,4
Faithfully follows the previous incarnations with a clean modern feel.,5
"Fairly fun game, although unless you're playing on a tablet, I wouldn't recommend it. It sucks the life out of your phone, and will heat up its processor something fierce. Other than that, it's a good time waster of the likes of Castle Crashers and such. Takes a lot of time to build and upgrade later.",4
Doesn't lag or bug out great for new game,4
,4
"Fun game, but the servers have been disconnecting me repeatedly over the last week, and its been getting worse.",3
Fun and reminds me of an old xbox game.,5
Not the kind of game you can sit down and play for more than  maybe 15 mind at a time but it's okay now and then,4
Only down side is the amount of time needed to wait and game is sparing on giving gems.,4
This is a great alternative to clash of clans,5
,3
Would like to be able to delete destroy or sell rooms,3
Expesive,5
Great dungeon game a little slow to get things built without spending real cash but worth the time.,5
Solid game... takes along time unless u pay,4
"I love Dungeon Keeper! It's social, competitive, low maintenance and FREE!!!!! A great way to take a brake from life and dominate your own little world full of imps and minions who do your every biding. I so love this game!!!",5
Takes a lot of time to get anywhere,5
I downloaded this because I was a DK fan and have only been mildly entertained. The most frustrating aspect of the game is the user interface. You'll spend hours rearranging because it's so difficult to zero in on what you're trying to click. I guess the devs expect you to be zoomed in like a panzie all the time. Other than that the game offers nothing new or exciting...not even sure why I still play.,3
,5
Love this game . Only thig I dont like is its so time consuming,5
,4
Only thing I don't like is how much more imps coast,5
"Patience is the virtue.  Save save save the gems!  Save enough for the first imp.  Love this game!  No money needed if you are patient.   Those bad ratings are those people who spent their gems early and complained the greed.   I'm mean really, the maker needs to make money right?  I've seen people spent hundreds on candy crush... Real hundreds.. Sigh.. And this game.... Lol great detailed design, better than dk2 for sure.",5
Fun,5
"Definitely not as awesome as DK or DK2, but it is a great mobile spin-off. When there's only so much you can do to bring DK to mobile, I think a good job was done to refresh my fondness for the franchise.",5
"A fun game might be hiding behind a pay to ""win"" system.  Unfortunately there is a massive delay between actions and minimal reward for devoting time to it.",1
This game wanna make you pay (EA of course...) but its really strategic and addictive,4
,5
Would give 5 star if chat was better.   Chat does not allow a running dialog with guild members.  Game play and over all experience would be better if chat improved.   üòÉ,4
Fun game but tends to crash during raids and gets very annoying.,3
Always enjoy slapping imps around!,5
,5
Slapping imps is a mini-game by itself.,5
Thanks EA for making fans wait so long for this train wreck,1
H,5
,3
I love this game .. it is awesome!!,5
,4
"As free to play mobile vomit goes, this one is less flaccid than most. Not another dragon clicker.",5
I would have rather paid two to three dollars for a full game than yet another freemium. This game is really good apart from the insane wait times.,3
But cool,4
,5
Great game,5
,5
,4
,4
Patience is key.,5
Addicting,5
,2
Wish gems were easier to get but other than that BADASS!!!!,5
It would be five stars if there were ways to earn more gems and they weren't so expensive to purchase.,4
Definitely a good game,5
"This game is funny, it's easy to get sucked into. Only a four because of graphics and I hate that it only takes one tap to dig dirt out. So you can accidentally dig out three units trying to cancel one.",4
Love this game.  Keeps consistent upgrades to keep you interested.   Could use a better clan setup.  Not a deal breaker.,5
Seriously the little coach in the game's name is Horny.,5
I enjoy playing,5
I like it. A little quirky. Can't tell how long you have on protection. Overall some good features.  Wish it was more like original.,4
,4
Not what I was expecting. Seems like the same thing that has already been done so many times before. Some originality would've been good.,2
,5
It's almost like the original game.,4
,5
"Hoped it would be like the PC version, and to many great lengths it was, but this version plays like several mobile games my wife likes to bury herself in, where you have to wait (sometimes days) to accomplish a level. A different kind of play is all, I guess...",5
They're not necessarily to enjoy this game! This is a decent homage to the classic. I'd love to see the classic one made for phones though.,4
,5
"That's no put down, I'm extremely picky on game time. I don't have much",5
If you have time to kill this game is a great way to spend it,5
Takes some time to build up your dungeon.,4
,5
Wonderful game.,5
This game has great graphics and its cool that you get to hear horny talk,5
Great fun game,5
"The game definitely has the potential to be great, one of the better mobile phone games even after its share of problems. Unfortunately they let the paid aspect of the app run a bit too wild. The game doesn't have enough going for it to warrant the steep pricing. Raids last a few minutes at best. The most enjoyable portion of the game has been the actual construction of the dungeon and they're already asking $10 for the 4th imp, a price that undoubtedly climbs up even greater for the next few.",3
,5
,5
,4
,5
"I love this game, it brings back fond memories for the classic DK games. However, it smacks of pay to win games where a fellow has to shell out half a ton of cash or snare in all his friends to get anywhere in the game at something other than a snail's pace.",4
Fantastic tower defense/war strategy very entertaining.,5
It's just not as fun as the old pc game.,2
If I ever actually got to play it I'm sure it would be fun. I could never get past the screen that said Checking for updates.,1
"Beautiful graphic, ok gameplay, miseable for free to play.  Takes forever to get anything done with out paying for gems.  Also, nothing like, or near as fun as DK2 for thr PC, one of my all time favorite games from the late 90's.",2
Beware buying gems.  The store is buggy and good luck getting any billing support.,1
Played the original dungeon keeper as a kid and loved it and this is almost as good as the original!,5
Fun game,5
I love the wanna be tim curry from legend voice for horny. But you still gotta pay to make it play faster,4
Only thing it takes a while and can b expensive.  But cool game,5
,4
"Expect long waits to do anything, it actually runs real time, and it can be expensive if you want to get anything done quickly. Not like the original games.",3
At first I was expecting some sort of weird game but once I got into it was pretty fun and I would recommended it  to lot of people if they like commanding games,4
Wish you got credits faster though only con,5
Kinda sucks everything is expensive and time consuming. Especially for the little things,5
Not for the person who likes full time game play,3
"I would rate this game 5 stars if there were an easier way to get the gems you need to get more imps,  without paying ungodly sums of real life cash... I have been playing for weeks, spent next to zero gems since the beginning of the game, and still only have 2 imps.   That being said, gameplay is fun and engaging, when you aren't waiting for timers, which is kind of a drag... I guess the best way to put it is that you won't be able to sit down and kill three hours with this game in one sitting.",3
It's so great to finally see the dungeon keeper rehashed!,5
,4
"Some interface items need improvement: Guild Chat, etc. But the game is very fun and addictive!",5
"Ive been waiting so long for this game to come back. My only issues with this game are that you cant direct your minions in battle... its not fun when one wizard destroys your heart because your force is at another part of your dungeon, and the cost/time of doing things like mining gems or upgrading traps is too high.",3
Love the concept,5
"Great game. Really great. The its got a little recource mgmt, a lot of tower defence, some little town, great real time stratigy. This games got it all. Only thing. Some times you can't see your imps working on thier things which is a problem. But reload the game and pow. The gafics are even grate on my phone. AND the only thing you realy realy have to spend your gems on are imps. And after 3 or 4 imps your gonna have to put up some real world cash. This is the first phone game I'll play for long time.",5
Things could be faster but I love it,5
,4
,5
"Not a fan of ""freemium"" games. It's fun.  But the limitations placed to squeeze the player hurts it in my opinion. Give us a ""full"" version and stop trying to nickel and dime.",3
"Bit slow on the start up, but that is the only bad thing I can say.",4
,1
Good game things cost way too much after few upgrades though.,4
,3
Takes toomlongbto getbthingscdone to play the game,3
Designing your dungeon and raiding other user dungeons is a lot of fun. Maybe there is still hope for a new version if dungeon keeper to return to the PC.,4
I love dungeon keeper.,5
It has the storyline of Overlord for Xbox.,5
,5
,5
"Its a really fun game, I just don't like being attacked by other players.",4
,4
I choose time. Save those gems for when it's actually important.,4
To pass time,5
,5
There's nothing to do. Click and wait. 24 hours to move a block. Hah.,1
Cool game,4
"Game play is fun and enticing,  the only downfall 2 an awesome game:  same as all the other glu games it costs 2 much money to build quickly and the wait time for construction is hours instead of minutes making the game play tedious and frustrating... which in turn leads us as gamers to other games and apps... make u r in app gem purchases cheaper 2500 for 2.99 and 10000 for 9.99 u will keep players a lot longer also when u r minions mine make the gems found a much larger number than 1 it is discouraging.",4
I never got to play the PC version and it's nice being able to have a good big time game studio dev this for my tablet!,4
This is a great game for your phone and where you don't have enough time to sit there for a hour.only thing I hate is when I'm playing and I go to raid someone and right in the middle of it the connection drops.fix that,4
,5
,5
Just wish I could slap my minions (not just the imps) like you did in the old game.,4
Only thing I don't like is the gimme real life money for gems. I already paid for this game back in the 90's.,5
Basic time based game. Nice feel for those who played the old pc version.,4
,4
I think this is a well put game but i think there should be an easier to earn gems,5
Always updating which is good to fix errors fun but yet challenging,4
Takes away some of my addition of The Simpsons Tap. Lmao,4
,3
Usually waiting a day to dig through something or do upgrades. Unless you are willing to fork over hundreds of dollars this game isn't worth the download. I loved the PC versions and this just isn't it. EA has ruined too many classic games with their pay to play games. I'd rather pay $10 for a game that is fun and time consuming because of being fun to play.,1
"I have always liked this game tho I still like the PC version. As with most apps, micro transactions is the name of the game. It is fun and entertaining but it could use more gameplay while waiting for your imps to finish the task at hand.",5
,5
5 star for grafix and sound efx,5
"Tha best game ever. EA, you guys need to bring this game back for the pc. Make it just like the bullfrog edition only with today's graphics, more levels, and new characters. Please!!!!!!",5
Great game worth the price tag,5
Fun app that's very addictive,5
,2
,2
It's not exactly like the pc game from the late 90s but still fun.,5
"The time management and dungeon building aspects are okay, however without spending money to buy additional gems everything takes forever. As for as engaging in actual combat and campaigns, gamer and I just feel like I'm button pushing, I have no idea of the strategy works. Its probably just me, but I suspect this is another area where buying gems to upgrade minions faster, might make a huge difference. So, fun is limited, unless you spend money",3
"Like most games if your willing to fork over cash you do better then those who play for free, that being said its still a fun free to play game",4
Great game evolution from the old dungeon keeper for the pc. Great graphics and easily managed,5
"The game is good, and is a decent call back to the PC games of yore; however the time restrictions and emphasis on gems can make this a very unsatisfactory app if you can't check it regularly. Its not uncommon for traps and upgrades to take 8+ hours. The only saving grace for this mechanic is that you spend gems to complete tasks now, but the cost seems to go up exponentially for longer time frames. All in all its not bad if you have the patience, but if you want it to be done quickly, be prepared to pay.",4
I love the old. School dungeon keeper great job,5
"I've been playing this over a week because I dearly loved the original games, but I feel like my greatest enemy is not an npc or a rival keeper, but the game design itself. Please, players, don't spend any money on this. Tell EA it's not okay to gut great games to fuel their own greed.",1
Horrible pay to win,1
,5
,5
I love it! I play it all the time!,5
,3
,5
Pretty good but not exactly like the original. Hard to get more imps and that greatly limits game play,4
Awsome game!!!!,5
I have always been a huge fan of the dungeon keeper games. Please please make a dungeon keeper 3,5
Its a bit slow acquiring stuff at first but once you get going its great fun,5
Great,5
"I never played the originals, but I like the idea of the game. They need to cut the work time, make gems easier to aquire, and enable movement of the mines and heart (or atleast expand the dungeon). Once you get most/all rooms and squeeze in the traps, everything is just crammed together.",3
Cool buts drops off my WiFi,5
Like everything but digging takes a little too long.,4
Works great,5
"It crashes a lot for me unless I'm on Wi-Fi, and even then it still crashes. You have to spend money to get anywhere in a reasonable time. Don't start it unless you're already connected to Wi-Fi.",3
Great game,5
Its a EA game so its pretty  good.,3
"Fun timesink, no issues with the app from a performance standpoint. Using an S4 phone.",4
,3
I'd rather see a new pc edition of this.  The game is ok but it takes forever to upgrade your resources.  Dungeon heart upgrade is 100k and I'm only collecting 5000 per log on.,4
Awesome,5
"Good adaptation of the PC version. The basic structure of the original turns out to be perfect for a smartphone. Like many free mobile games,  there are incentives to spend money,  but you can have a lot of fun without that if you are willing to play slowly.  Put in a few minutes and let the game catch up to your orders; otherwise,  plan to put in some real money. I'd prefer to have a non - PVP option, but it isn't a big deal (unlike,  say,  Facebook games).   Glad to see DK available again and on mobile.",4
,5
"Well put game, runs smooth, no issues here.",4
Its a fun gamebut theimps cost the moch money,5
,5
Yeah!,5
"In app purchases required, or else you end  up just waiting for your imps to dig out the necessary gems so that you can progress. Not really fun unless you're willing to pay.",2
,5
,4
"The goblins cost too many gems, and the dollar/gem exchange rate is too low",4
This is a game with great strategic game play. It has some bugs like the skeletons go to the middle all the time and are ineffective when they're there so yeah. It's worth it.,4
"Tried this game on a whim and had a blast! Reminds me of old school w.o.w. Definitely recommend this game to just about anybody who likes strategy and world building. Plus money is an option, not mandatory.",5
Game is great aside from having to re summon minions even if they survive an attack,4
Great for tower defense lovers and feels like overlord in a sense.,5
,5
,5
Love it fun,5
I played the original game on PC when it first came out. loved it then this does the real game great justice if not makes it better to take it on the go with you.,5
,3
,5
Great fun app,5
People say you cant get anything done without spending money. Untrue. With time you can accomolish anything. If you are a fan of tge okd pc games you will love this!,5
Love it,5
,5
,5
The in-app purchase model has never been attractive to me. Maybe it makes the devs more $$ but I'd pay $10 for this game for full access but I wouldn't spend anything in game. Maybe a combo of the two models would benefit everyone.,3
,5
If there were better more efficent ways to get the green gems other then buying them with real $ it would be a much better game. Seems to me it's the same old greedy EA ruining another great classic game Dungeon Keeper.,1
In game prices are too high. Definitely,3
Glitches some but I don't care‚Ä¶,5
"I remember how fun the original was to play. This is just another one of those fortress type games where your not given enough flexibility to be creative and stand out, you just keep upgrading hoping you'll get stronger. And that takes longer and longer, and never really makes you stronger. I've only played this long out of love for the old game.",2
Love the raids and the strategy involved in the game. The music is catchy as well.,5
Would be better if we could have more imps and the glitches of imps were fixed. I also dont like the limit of how many creatures we can get. There is no reason to keep playing once things are maxed out. The guild area seems pretty limited as well,2
,5
Very cool game,5
Good,4
It's a lot of fun. My kids love slapping the imps.,5
,5
Not bad,4
"Probably for balance purposes, but are the excessive waiting times needed? I know gems speed them up, but still kinda meh on the whole idea. Other than the waiting and waiting for new stuff to do it is by no means a bad game. Maybe cutting all the timers down to 25% would be a bit more reasonable. Or make it cost less gems.",4
I like to build. This gives plenty of opportunity to do just that. It is a delight to strategise an enemy's likely plan of attack and to heavily trap that route.,5
Looks like the original game except for the pay to win feature.,2
"The computer version was way, waaay better and could defend with your imps. There needs to be more to do than just sitting and waiting otherwise game gets stale...",3
This game is pretty fun and very well balanced.,5
,3
Not a bad game. I was a big fan of the pc versions.,4
Title,4
Been playing for a few weeks and can't get enough.  Love the strategic challenges.  Only wish I could search for specific members as my friends and I would love to battle one another's dungeons.,5
,5
Nice graphics and stays close to the spirit of the original but the imp hiring progression is way too slow. Not enough gem recovery per dig and I hate apps that force you to pay to progress faster.,3
The game of my dreams!,5
"This game could be a whole lot more fun if it didn't take so darn long to do anything. I understand the F2P model, but this takes it to an extreme. 1 day to clear one block...really? How much fun can a game be when you log in for 1 minute and you're done with everything you can do? And if the gems were reasonably priced, I might consider it, but the prices are outrageous. Total waste of a great IP. I play just for the ambience but I will never pay for this ""game"".",2
OK,4
No problems.,5
"Sometimes becomes blank screen when starting up, and sometimes imp project progress doesn't show. But, despite these, the game is great for those with or without a lot of time to devote. Checking in every hour or so for imp/project maintenance, or taking a bit of time to go raiding or dungeon editing make for versatile time consumption. The humor isn't bad either.",4
Great fun!,5
Game is fun and doesnt freeze up or have tons of ads or any of that bs.,4
"My only complaint is how hard it is to get imps.  Other than that I love it, since I've loved DK since the early days.",4
,4
"EA has made this game to be played in one of two ways: play free and only for a couple minutes each day, or...  Pay $20/hour past the first few minutes.  Game designers should NEVER dictate how i play a game, that's my decision.  $50 to purchase the last 2 imps?  EA is a terrible, money-grubbing abomination.",2
Kind of like dungeon keeper 2 for pc but you can use 2 or more minions for a project and can summon more thwn one. I find the fact that you need 600nhems for a 3rd minoon disturbing. Other then that a good game,3
Love this game.,5
"Micro transactions ahoy! Would be a good game if the money grubbing leeches at EA didn't purposely hinder your progress by requiring gems, which cost real world money and they barely give you any for what you pay for. I refuse to pay $5 just to remove one block of dirt, the micro transactions are that bad",1
"I played the original, then the second installment and now the app.  Still a great game",5
Different,5
"Its a good game as far as Free-to-Pay games go.  There were a few bugs where a working imp would show available, but that issue seems to have been fixed.  In comparison to other freemium games I can say at least I have 3 Imps (builders) without spending any money, where in clash of clans I'm stuck with 2 builders for the foreseeable future.  To EA, I will make a plea to re-release the original Dungeon Keeper to the market as well.  I was a huge fan of the original, and can see where all the one star ratings come from.  Think of it like this... lets say you had a beloved childhood puppy, we'll call him fluffy.  So you and Fluffy hang out all them time, but just like PC games, puppies age too.  So, eventually you never get to see Fluffy again.  Jump ahead 15 or so years, and you hear Fluffy is back.  You are thrilled of the idea of seeing Fluffy again, but when you finally get to see him, you find he was stuffed and mounted.  Then the taxidermist wants to charge you to pet the thing.    Anyway, why not give people the choice to play the original or play the Freemium style.  Pay to play fans will still buy Gems, and the hardcore original fans will stop giving this version 1 star",4
Need cheaper imps,4
Don't spend gems foolishly.,4
Lower cost of imps or let us use gold to buy them.,2
Yep this game is pretty cool..,4
I really like the app I use to play it a long time ago it sux there's no way to get gems free but o'well its still a great app,5
I paid for a few extra imps when I started to get a jump start and I have grown in power quickly.  I am having a good time playing the game and would recommend it to my friends.,5
"Dungeon Keeper lets me build the dungeon I always wanted! If you want to have intruders caught in traps and trolls gaurding gold-stuffed treasuries, Dungeon Keeper is the game for you!",5
If it weren't for the fact that you must wait interminably to accomplish anything if you're not willing to pay exorbitant sums of real money.,3
When I saw the title I just had to get this game.  Anyone who played the 1997 computer game will find familiar game play updated for a new century. Those who do not like having to interact with other players may feel a little left out with longer build times etc. Top notch graffics and  amusing sound effects.  Now if only they could patch the original for Windows 7.,5
I am enjoying this version but I would have preferred a truer recreation of the original.  I like to play games where I have the choice of playing with others or not.  Forcing me to have to interact with others detracts from my overall enjoyment.,4
Played the  computer game decades ago now loving it as an app.,5
"I actually genuinely enjoy this game, but the micro-transactions are slightly too expensive. Your third worker is the equivalent of $10. I didn't much mind that one, but at higher levels of play, people can spend money to protect themselves. Gathering of gems (money-currency) is very difficult. That being said, it looks like they are making gems easier to obtain.",4
What cemented my liking this game was blasting my way into another keeper's dungeon heart and looting more money than I could carry.,5
You can bypass micro transactions as you literally dig up the games premium currency. Play smart and be patient. Don't let the bad press dissuade you.,4
"As a big fan of the original DKs, I was less than enthusiastic about a microtransaction version coming out. I'm surprised at how much fun in having with it. The pace is, of course, much slower than the originals. But, as long as you're okay with the more casual approach, the optional micro transactions aren't going to impede you and you'll likely have fun with the PvP features and the most excellent return of Horny.",4
,3
Or is the game intended to be a poor mining simulation? If so then congrats on a mediocre game. If anyone has invested any time playing this game they would have noticed that any real defense is based on expanding to the outer wall which requires breaking 24 hour rocks. Since that realization the only thing I ever get to do is slap imps a few times a day. Is that supposed to be fun? I'm trying to see if the game opens up after that.  The pay walls are severely broken. $2.50 or so to break a rock? Seriously?,1
Loved the original love this one too,5

Fun game,5
Even for an EA game this is great,5

Great game..fun game to play here and there Awesome graphics,5
Love building and raiding,5
"This could have been a great game, but the mandatory gem purchases will force me to bail on this game shortly. I've seen quicker build times in Eve Online!  So disappointed that you went for the pocket to build instead of the pocket for optional creatures or better loot.  You're not getting a dime!",3
"A bit slow going, but fun.  Gives me hope they will revive the franchise.",4
Play for free casually or if you just have to have more buy the gems. Same fun humor as original game,5

Fantastically done recreation of the original game into a mobile app. Love it. Almost too much fun.,5
Wonderful glad this game was remade although slower and smaller dungeon,5
Great quality,5

You will not be disappointed.  Another great game & it is put out by a great company that knows how to pass time with gaming,5
Im having troubles getting my 3rd imp,5
This is a good fun game,5
Short and scrappy version of the classic.  Build your dungeon over time. Build time  gets longer and longer like days for 1 construct.  Includes single player and pvp. Includes all the humor from the original . Warning. It is a freemium game like most these days but you don't really need to pay 2 win,4
"It could be better; the trade of time/(real) money for gems isn't worth it, but overall it isn't a terrible Dungeon Keeper game. Hopefully its success will mean another full DK game.",4
I Am The King Of Dungeon Keepeers !,4
Make pepole chikins,5
The original game and this have NOTHING in common.,1
This app has a great range of play and is very easy to learn and understand. The app does a great job of bringing back one of the great games.,4
,5
.,5
Very kool game and playable for hours at a time.,5
Please just make Dungeon Keeper 2 or 3 for Android and I'll pay money for them.,4
Aside from that your standard pay to win,3
"I like the game alot. Very good game play, art  and it's funny. But I you don't pay... well let's just say that I might get the torture chamber by the time of my funural!!!",2
"Definitely not DK 1 or 2, if you get into it without that expectation you are in for a treat. Buying gems is a must.",5
"Nothing like the originals on pc, wouldn't be too bad if the gem vs time issue wasn't so pronounced... still a good game to play throughout the day..",4
A new take on the old classic.,5
Reminds me of the old school version of the game!,5
,5
,5
This brings back my childhood. I love the this game its just as cool as the original,5
"This was one of my all-time favorite game franchises on the PC, so it's great to see something that recalls the experience on a mobile device. It's a bit disheartening that it follows the same pay or wait format that most mobile games do. I'd rather pay for a full game up front and then decide how much I'm going to play, like an adult, than be bottlenecked by the game.  That said, however, this game beats all the other games in its class hands down, so five stars.",5
,5
It's enjoyable for what it is.  Expensive in app purchases leaves much to be desired.,3
,4
Good time killer and fun time. Few quirks here and there but nothing that detracts from the game.,4
To much fun no need for money,5
Game!!! Its different than what I play but very good,5
Game,5
"I was a huge fan of the old Dungeon Keeper applications for the PC. This new version makes it painfully slow to advance in the game unless you pay to buy gems. Otherwise, it's a fairly decent modernization of a great classic games.",2
,5
This app is very enjoying but costly and time consuming......Wish the gems were cheaper......but other then that is an  over all a great game. Very much like the first 2 for pc besides the cost.....lol,5
"Connection issues are a huge annoyance, making it more of a home tablet game than a mobile one. However if you have patience and only want to play about five minutes a day it's a lot of fun.  Only spend gems on more umps, even in training.",2
Favorite pc game of all time! Finally for mobile device is even better!,5
,5
However it is still strategic,3
,5
Super fun and always things to do in the game,5

This game is awesome fun!!  Take your time and just  be eeevviiillll!!,5

"DK Mobile is a relatively bug-free game and considering how small the objects are, control is better than expected.  One star falls away when I consider how much battery power this game takes.  A normal game session of one raid, resource collection, an imp slap, recruitment and sending imps to build takes about four percent of my battery life on an S3.  Another star falls for the lack of a rallying flag.  Minions sit around, allowing the whole rest of the dungeon to be captured.",3
,5
I started playing and I'm literally hooked it's like if I don't keep up with it hourly I feel like I'm missing so much. I really enjoy all of it.,5
Its a really fun game but gems are crazy expensive... and it take a long time to play without them I think the ge would be better if you lower the price having more people play as of now I spent some money building my dungeon but I have not been raided in a long time so I am starting to think this game is losing steam because of greed. Shame to its a fun game,4
I wish the game did things faster than hours or days at a time... but I love the game otherwise.,5
,5
What the title says,1
"Yeah you gotta wait for everything unless you buy gems, but its a good set up and do something else while you catch up on other games thing. If your impatient, this isnt your game",5
We all play this in my family :),5
It's a fun game and I thoroughly enjoy it,4
Good to have horny back but they took all the fun out of dk dungeon building and turned it into the same slow bs strategy games that are all over fb and mobile. When carving out one tile takes one day that ain't dk,4
I have always been a fan of this series,4
"See, having to wait days for things? Sure you can raid often, that's great, but I would prefer to have more than just three imps at the point I'm at. That or I'd like multiple imps to work on one thing to cut down on time. Its frustrating the time it takes and it effectively makes it a pay to win game. If I put in the same amount of time as someone with more imps, more imps wins",2
,4

Unbalanced,1
Fun time consumer,5
Though there is a lot different between this version of the game and the pc game it came from it's similar enough to still get the same feel. The only real gripe I have is the payment system to the publisher. I'd rather pay for a fully unlocked game up front than pay as I go for speed ups or more imps.,4
"For starters, this is an objective review. It is not Dungeon a keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2. If you're looking for something like that, this is NOT the game you're looking for.  In a sentance: there are better, cheaper ways to kill your time. Right from the start, the game tries to teach you to use Gems, the micrograms action currency, so speed up the progress of tasks to just a few short seconds. While the wait times early on aren't all that bad, building and upgrading rooms quickly becomes a pain. 2 days to upgrade, 1 day to mine out a block of stone. They make elements of the game a grind, so as to encourage your laziness, and an addiction to instant gratification, so that they can drain your money. To do a task, you need imps. Got both imps mining? Can't do anything!  That sums up the game, honestly. Not paying means that not only are you at a distinct disadvantage, but you're waiting for a whole lot of nothing to happen. And waiting 2 days to upgrade a storeroom, several days to buildup resources, multiple setbacks from being raided (and having resources stolen), it's simply not worth it in the end.",1
The dungeon is better when you running it instead of enslaved in it!,5

A great and addictive game..,5
Fun and creative with some cool content.,5
"Seul probl√®me, c'est long!!! Mais c'est gratuit donc 4*",4
So far a great experience,5
,4
Just don't spend your gems early,5
,5
"You don't necessarily have to buy anything to enjoy this game. Just be patient, and work at the game's speed instead of using the 'skip' feature. It's still plenty addictive, just slower.",5
Great game,4
Very fun to play keeps me busy,5
,3
Guilty pleasure,4
Dude,5
Few improvements to make game more like original pc version would be nice. Would purchase this app if an update requiring purchase that made it more authentic.,4
,4
,5
"Lots of good content, but it takes forever to get anything done.",3
,3
Overall the game is for long term players unless they have lots of money to invest. I loved the original dungeon keepers and having a game to bring back the nostalgia is great.,4
Good way to kill some time.,5
Load... Play... Plunder...,5
Excellent game,5
"I was a big fan of the old PC game, so when I saw the app, I had to try it. The adaptation is good, but the game crashes frequently.",3
simple yet very entertaining,4
It's a ok game not to bad,4

"Love the game. Wish I could get the wallpaper back again, but the option won't come back up. Even looked on the internet to search it down with no luck. Somebody help!",5
Keep up the good.work,5
Need to make purchases cheaper. Other than that it is a great game.,4
Great Game.,4
I love it,5
This game fills that missing piece of my heart left open sense dungeon keeper 2,5
,4
"This is a great game for any age,  fun hours of play",5
"Thanks for the good game guys, wish I didn't have to wait so long for things though. But it's still fun!",5
Game is fun but gems are so outragiously hard to aquire and waaaay too dang expensive! Who pays $80 for a phone game??? Because thats  how much it costs to unlock all the imps... on top of everything taking days and days to build or upgrade...,1
Almost as good.,5
Very good game could use a once a day roulette to win gems.,5
Fun time killer.,5
It's fun to raid other people's dungeons,5
It's one of those games that tries to make you wait or nickel and dime you to death :) but it is a nice throwback to the original dungeon keeper,5
"I wish they had just updated the graphics on the original, I would have paid to play such a game.",3
This is a click and wait adventure capitalizing on an already successful name. This is not dungeon keeper material,1
...but too much time waiting.,4
Great game that rekindled all the fun when I played it as a kid.,5
They need to lower the price on imps,5
Fun game that doesn't take much time to play.,5
Great time killing/strategy game with plenty of upgrades.,5
,4
Great app lots of fun...can create your dungeon however you want and can get creative and devious,5
This game is best played episodically - understand how its been monetized and play accordingly.,5
Awsome,5
,5
Having fun the heavier rock starts to take some time but building more and more,5
"Easy, entertaining and lots of laughs.",4
This game is very fun if you like puzzles and dungeons :),5
I played the Dungeon Keeper games on my PC for years....loved controlling and training my minions to conquer...this is a great mobile adaptation...just a little unhappy with the money requirements...if you are unwilling to wait days for upgrades.... Overall a great game!,5
Improved performance with latest update. Still slow to open app due to need to update with every launch. Was 1 star; now give it 3.   Was never a fan of games where you constantly have to check in to make progress. Still slow to develop dungeons without buying gems.,3
"Very good game, one of the best. .... try it. .. you will like it!",5
This game is great all except for the micro transactions. Iv put in a ton of hours and only have 3 imps to build because they expect you to buy more gems for an ungodly amount of money per gem to get my next im I would need to pay like $20. Just wish they didnt depend on the micro transactions to let you play the game,3

"No need to buy gems to play, fun to raid others dungeons steal their gold and stone.",4
Absurdly long wait times but has room for creativity and is charming.,3
Not quite the Dungeon Keeper I remember but still very fun. It is something that you play in 5 to 10 minute bursts when you have an idle moment. Perfect for the busy adult world.,5
Awesome game. Great time killer.,5
I would rated higher if it wasn't pay to play,3
"I really like playing this game, it's super addictive.  Come to find out my best friend was playing it too and we didn't know at first",5

Having a issue with the game I  can not buy gems. I want someone to contact me asap,5
"I haven't played all that much yet so I'll update this review later however there is an audio issue when using my Bluetooth ear buds (jaybird bluebuds x), the audio seems to repeat making it sound choppy and like an echo. The issue persists after disconnecting the ear buds and the audio is fixed only after restarting the game however if I reconnect the issue occurs again. I've noticed this issue with other games but not all, which make me believe its a specific way the game audio is being handled.",3

For 20 years now EA has bought up franchises and destroyed any good game that didnt involve sports. This game is no different. EA please stick to football and quit ruining every other genre of game. This thing is a crash happy memory pig.,1
"if you liked the original, you will like this. for patient builder.",5
"Everything is rediculously expensive with in game currency, or takes days ... Oh but you can spend tons of real life money for simple things like.... Oh I don't know, being able to do 3 actions a day as opposed to 2 for only 5 dollars. Or 20 dollars to down a few walls... Really guys?",1
Fix it else u waste the time I have to enjoy in my life,1
"Dungeon based tower defense, was going great,  till the heart was level 5, then everything crashes to a halt,  you're unable to process any further in the game till you level up the dungeon heart to level 6, which will require 400k ore,  you're going to have to level up 1 quarry to level 8 & a second quarry to level 6, so expect 2 run and exciting weeks of waiting to play your game.... Well,  unless you want to pay to play,  keeper.....",3
"Pros: good graphics, easy game play, challenging battles.  Cons: It takes way to long to build and dig out. Really, 24 real time hours for a gem vain that only gives one gem?  Suggestion: shorten build and dig times, give out more gems, and maybe make things cost a little less.  Other than that I like playing it.",3
"I wanted to like this game.  I loved both of the original games.  This game, however, is a disgrace.  It's money grubbing, pure and simple.  They took everything that was awesome about the game and ruined it.  If you want to play the game the way as it was intended, prepare to spend money.  A lot of money.  Or, you can just buy the originals on GOG for a lot, lot less.  Avoid this game at all costs.   Unless you've got a bunch of money to waste.",1
I have alot of fun playing it,5
Not worth it. It takes too long to level up decent enough to enjoy it. The credits you buy aren't enough to help with more than to buildings/minions.,1
If you hv boost mobile phone hzc this app will not work good. But I up graded my phone an all the problem I had is now gone away. Keep up the great work y'all,5
"Just too many bugs! I have to launch the game 3 to 5 times for it to work, but now it won't get past the connecting screen...",1

Basic tasks require exorbitant amounts of time to complete.  That is unless you want to throw a couple of $100 bills in and give it a flush then you can really grasp the Depths of this abysmal failure at resurrecting a classic. AVOID,1

"2 days to build a building unless I want to log in every hour which will make it a much more manageable 1 day? Unless I want to spend $2.50 to finish it right now?

Game is fun but poor design and takes to long to progress without money,1

"You get penalized for not  getting into the game when it first came out.  Imps were 500 gems for a level 4. I was charged 1200 for one, which I refused to pay.     Put $30 into the game buying gems. But, I'm walking away due to the inequities. And EA doesn't seem to care.",1
"Made an in-app purchase and no gems. Sent an email to dev and they direct me to help website that does not have a mobile games page. I really justwant the gems at this point, please help!",3
Terrible...nothing like the simplicity and addiction of tower defense.  I uninstalled the game within first 5 min b/c there is too much overwhelming crap to learn!,1
Lower your cost for gems or rase the amount given making the game a boar and I am about to uninstall it .... if you want to get rich fast lower your prices a lot of people will spend more if its less,2

"Every time I go to raid the connection is lost.  I never get to complete the attack. Lose my minions, waste gold, not get my xp for mana etc.  What a waste.  I spent 20$ on gems  and feel completely ripped off.  Getting booted from raid!  Rebate my money please.  Am uninstalling this scam app",2
,2
"I was super excited for this game and hoped the dynamics were going to be like dungeon keeper 1 and 2, but they aren't...Takes forever to play without buying gems like everyone else has said and doesn't have that same feel.",1
Just make the game $3-5 and sell a ton.,1
Cool,3
Pay 2 play. 2 time consuming 2 getting things done. Could've been better if time constraints were less,1
"This game has a lot of potential that is totally ruined by the micro transactions. $75 to get an upgrade that isn't even permanent! It only lasts 3 months. Also, building and upgrading is so poorly paced that the only players who are really excelling at the game are those who took advantage of early cheat bugs. Skip this one.",1
Please fix asap.,1
"Drops me out of the game, can't even log in properly",1
"The game is structured in a way that makes it extremely hard to progress without buying gems. I was a huge fan of the original, plan to uninstall this quickly",1
Nice game but why does the song says he is   horny?,5
This game is very addicting. I can't put it down,5
"This is more a test of patience than a game. With some blocks taking 24 HOURS to mine. And it doesn't help that the game trying to get you to spend as much gems as possible. And then it has the will to say the ""best value"" of gems is the $100 option. Just don't play this cash cow.",1
"Have to reinstall if it fails to patch even once. Can't login. Almost always leads to an ""Error 7"", and now I can't even see what my imps are working on! What was a good classic paid game now became an IAP-based mobile game.",1
Too many microtransactions to do anything,1
Pretty much Pay to win...,1
"EA already said it won't count the votes less than five stars. All the same, only even gets two stars for sheer graphics values alone.",2
"This is a beautiful HD spinoff of a tremendously underrated and under-appreciated game.  The pay to play dynamic is brutal if you want to play a fast paced game, but if you don't mind playing for 5 to 10 min every couple of hours, it's tolerable.  I imagine that EA was partially after retaining play value here because it would get boring pretty quick if the pace was fast.  Waiting (at this point) 4 days to upgrade a building doesn't make it unplayable.  It just means you are one imp short while it is building.",4
Great game.  Good balance of graphics and sound,5
"But I have to keep reloading,",4
"Graphics and sounds are great, had lots of potential - it's a shame it's impossible to play without buying the ludicrously expensive gem packs. Most freemium games are at least playable without spending a lot, but not this one.  Very disappointing.",1
,3
"I can't believe EA did this to such a great franchise, all I wanted was a nice revamp of the game but all I got was pay to complete actions and waiting 1 day to take out a block. I don't want that.",1
"Game looks like it could be fun. However, in order to move ahead in the game you need ""gems"" and there is no way to get them without letting your minions dig literally for hours or buy them from the game developers. I'm uninstalling it.",1
It would only cost an arm and a leg to have it not play like a mobile game,1
,2
"The way to really enjoy this game is to play it in short bursts.  Don't expect to play for an hour in one go.  Instead I check in every few hours as a quick break.  I'll spend a couple minutes starting some upgrades or raiding a dungeon, then log off.  The only downside of this approach is that it does take a while for the game to start since it refreshes game status from the cloud.  Playing this way makes the game much more enjoyable - it really is a very good game - and prevents having to spend gems.  My original review:  The original Dungeon Keeper back in the day was pretty fun.  This new version would be a great remake except everything takes forever in the hopes that you continuously make in-game purchases.  Certain upgrades may require that your minions toil for several hours but there is always an option to cut the time if you spend some jewels.  If you follow this pattern, however, you'll find yourself spending $20-30 a week.  Either you decide that is worth the investment or you just decide not to play at all.",4
"Cave-in is supposed to protect you from attacks during the stated period, but you'll still get attacked (even if you buy a cave-in).",2
Join our guild!  THE YORKSHIRE TERRIERS  / Waiting time in the game is tooo long!,3

This was one of my fav games on the PC..I was hoping they would make it for Android! AWESOME!,1
Says 99mb needed to patch I have 300 or so,1
I have tries to buy gems many times and it does not work just says wait for other purchase to finish but never works please fix,1
"Since my last review the bugs have been fixed, and the game is thoroughly enjoyable again. Only complaint I have now is how hard it is to unlock imps. I wish there was a way to earn free gems or to unlock the imps. I have 3 and I'm only just now back up to 250 gems out of 1200 for the fourt imp. Other than that though, this game is perfect for people who don't feel the need to constantly play.",5
"as stated in the video by nerdcubed, this game is terrible. some blocks take 24 hours to mine out. taking the biggest micro transaction of about 70.00, you can mine about 56 of the hardest to break blocks. have fun wasting money",1
,1
Okay this game is fun and all but I keep F***ing  losing connection to this god dam game sever code 7 or it tries to reconnect and it sets up a new lair and have to basically start the app all over again. I say again this app is garbage if you want to keep quitting the game and signing in again over and over and over and GOD DAM OVER this is your game. F***ing EA   Now it doesn't even work the app doesn't even start its just start load screen its says connecting then poof back to my main screen. -_-,1
"This game has the potential to be great, except the costs are overwhelming. You can't do anything without more imps, which cost a lot of money. Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms with shelling out a few bucks, but the prices are insane. When coupled with the build times, the game is unplayable. I refuse to spend any money out of principle - which is a shame, because it's actually kind of fun, just not console-priced fun. I won't support EA in this venture.",1
You have to pat to play this game. If you don't then you will have a really hard time. Plus others can steal your resources while you ate sleeping.,1
"Everything in this game costs entirely too much in gems or sheer time.  24 hours to break some stones?  Unless you drop a ton of cash in to it, then it will be instant.  HATE the micro purchase system.  Rather pay one time fee for steady play.",1
Great game endless fun,5
Almost as good as the original.,3
"I'm okay with IAP, but you barely get through the tutorial before you hit a 24 hour paywall. And underneath the shameless greed the game itself isn't that good, unworthy of the Dungeon Keeper name. About as much fun as staring at a loading screen.  Uninstalled.",1
The amount of micro transactions they throw at you is a constant annoyance. Also it plays more like a Facebook game then something I would expect with the dungeon keeper name.,1
"I would rather pay outright for this game than have to spend money on it. It may be really fun like the original, but I don't know because after 20 minutes there's nothing to do without spending money. Took a great concept and ruined it.",1
a really cool fun time waster,5
,4
I haven't found any bugs yet and its a great game if you have time to play it,2
Cool huh,5
,1
Overall the game is good for a mobile game! Original was one of my all time fav.   Takes forever to build things up and imps are expensive!,3
Entertaining and funny. Great way to kill some time.,5
"Faithfully reproduction, just like I remember it!!!",5
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey,3
Buggy updating seems to have to repeat all the time,3
"EA has taken a classic game and turned it into a device to separate fans of the original from their money. Waste of time. Things that use to take 5 minutes now take a whole day to complete, unless you cough up some cash.",1
,2
"Whit out investing money u look at a game that u will check once, maybe twice a day. A normal green rock takes  4th to dig ...some greener rock 24 h...After a few initial updates every ting takes forever ....unless you spend real money of  corse. If u  have time for a game a few minutes a day this is for u...If not..DO NOT INSTALLED!",1
"Wanted it to be a faithful reissue, but it's a money-sucking mockery at best. Pity, the graphics and audio are nice.",1
"This thing kept crashing on me,  and took multiple attempts to get it to accept commands.  Thing is, when it behaved itself,  it was a pleasant game. A bit slow sans cash, but it was not bad while it worked.",1
,1
I was happy to find dungeon keeper on the tablet until I played the game. Its a great disappointment and rather boring.,1
"I like free to play games, but this one is not a good one.",1
"Everything you try to do takes forever. You literally have to set alarms to come back once a job is done. 12 hours to dig ONE tile! Don't like it? Pay us 10$. Want an extra worker? Pay us 20$. To top that off, EA blocks ratings that are under 5 stars if you try to rate it from inside the game. Avoid this game unless you're dumb enough to support this horrible business model.",1
Ok,3
The multi player aspects are all horribly designed.  Should have stuck to single player.,2
"30 mins of troop building and 3 hours waiting for mana, all ruined by losing connection momentarily (I'm on stable WiFi). More attacks than i can count ruined by connection issues.  I'll pay small amount of $$ to get a leg up, but unless you drop $30+ it won't benefit you.  Hard to protect goodies.  If you want to advance, constantly attack to raise funds, stay connected the whole time, and try to get enough to build the next thing before you stop or get raided back.  Die hards only.  Not for casual players",1
Pretty cool. Reminds me of war craft,4
It is a shame that such a great game has been turned into a money trap for players. Sad indeed.,1
,4
Game drops a lot even aon a strong WiFi.  Game takes very long to start.  Freemium gameplay requires a lot of grinding.  Watered down version from original.,1
One of the best games revived! Hats offb mythic!,5
Its free.,4
Loved this series growing up! Cant wait to see whats in store!,5
Can't dounloud stupid URL ERROR  can't play now,1
"Played this on the PC back in the day, this is awesome!!",5
"Love this game,  just wish the imps didn't get so expensive.",5
"I have only once spent money on a mobile game. This game has me so sucked in that I felt the need to drop money on it. Yes, there are some minor bugs that cause me to have to force stop on my Samsung mega. That is super annoying but not so much that it kept the world's cheapest person (moi) from spending real money on fake gems.",5
Would much rather pay a flat rate for the game than shell out money to do anything in less than a day. Stop your money grubbing EA. We thought you would learn that after that disasterous SimCity launch.... also my game restarted and the same problem happened to my friend.,3
Had initially gave this app 5 stars then after figuring out that it was virtually impossible to play without coin I downgraded rating... it's fun in the beginning when build times are lower...but once you advanced to mid lvl dungeons...it's very hard to play for free...players will advance to mid lvl and lose interest after waiting for upgrades.,2
,5
Pay to play kills the game,1
Fun as...hell!,5
Good game all things considered,3
,5
Additional stars can be bought for 9.99$,1
"Game disconnect while playing,,,canceling raids.  Forfeiting resources to other players poorly designed.",1
I have been waiting and hoping for Dungeon Keeper 3 or some version for tablets. I was so excited when I opened the Play Store and saw this game. Its kind of just exactly like Clash of Clans except twice as slow to advance and twice as frustrating because it's a joke trying to pass as one of my favorite games ever.,1
Takes me back to the original game which I loved. Plays well on my phone very few bugs that I have noticed. Dont mind the micro transactions either. Very happy the original announcers voice is in the game too.,5
Getting real tired of the game reverting back to level 1. 3 stars until fixed which should be soon or i will uninstall.,5
Freemium can just go and die.,1
Objects move on the screen to complete many obstacles at will. Amazing!,5
While not true to the old DK it still has the same feel.  Love it.,5
"Yea I can uninstall and reinstall, restart my phone, or wait days.  Either way the game will only work for a short time then just freeze constantly.  I'd like a refund EA.  Its just plain robbery to add an in app purchase system followed by a game that just doesn't work. very disappointed.",1
"Installed this with fond memories  of Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 only to get kicked in the nuts by this insult to gaming, not just to the DK series, but to gaming as a whole. This is the biggest piece of garbage I played since trying to play RAGE or Operation Raccoon City. Made it a whole 60 seconds before uninstalling this steamy pile of fail.",1
amazing,3
This game won't even load. It gets to the part where you slap the guy to start the game and then just closes. I have reopened this game more then 15 times. Uninstalling now.,1
"I want to love it, i miss the original but why are you making it so hard?",1
"Heard lots of good things about this game, but it just plain will not work. Too bad. Their commercial looks cool.",1
"If you don't mind playing for 5 minutes then waiting a few hours for 1 or 2 things to finish, then you might like this game.  Or you can spend a few hundred and play as long as you like.",1
This game would be superb if it didn't constantly disconnect and cause you to loose the dungeon raid or defence you are right in the middle of.  I would guess that I've lost 20000 to 30000 ingame gold because of this.,3

Awesome game,5
Trying to allow others to play and I can not get it to work with multiple play accounts as I read in the forums,1
"Loving it, you will too.",4

Deff diffrent from others of the like. But fun non the less,2
Awesome,5
"Built the useless guild room, now I'm stuck. It's a huge security risk in my dungeon with no way to remove it.",2
,1
It'd okay. But it cost gems to even buy imps.,1
I like it,5
Join a guild and plunder enemy dungeons while making yours an impenetrable lair.,5
Slow moving without paying but has some interesting mechanics.,3
"The mobile version of Dungeon Keeper is a travesty and should be avoided by any and everyone. What could have been a fun, renvisioning of Dungeon Keeper is instead destroyed by corporate greed. Everything in this game is engineer to make you want to spend money on gems and this game starts twisting in that knife and never stops.",1
The game is fun but require too much gold and rocks. It takes forever to earn gold and rocks. Creating buildings take too long.  You can tell they are pretty much after your money.,3
Awesome port of an old game,5
Awesome,5
"Like to play games in short spurts? I don't, but that is all this game allows. That's is unless you willing to pay heavily. Untill they change that i`m rating this as 1 star, because I can't go lower.",1
"This game is not worthy of the dungeon keeper name. I really wish EA would stop destroying good games. The original game was great. Just make good games and let me pay for it, I would've easily payed $10 for a real dungeon keeper game.  What makes it even worse is the pay to play is completely unbalanced. You either wait a day for something to happen or you can pay a crap load of money to do the same thing in like 2 seconds. Make the gems cheaper, the effect they have less and the default wait time a lot faster  No one wants to pay to not play the game, and that's basically how your gem system works",1
"Just another soulless attempt to get at my wallet. It's horribly depressing to have the good name of dungeon keeper drug through the mud like this.  These ""games"" have nothing to do with gaming, and everything to do with tapping away your pay check for the good of ea.",1
Game is designed from start to finish to revive and exploit an old franchise and to wring money out of consumers at every turn. Making the game slower just to make consumers spend sums of money on a single action is just absurd and wrong.,2
This is a fun game.,4
Great game,2

"First of all, my heart goes out to the developers of this game. As a big fan of the PC games, I could see elements in this game that show they were fans as well. There is so much good in the design of this game. Unfortunately, it is never allowed to mature as it's being held hostage behind an oppressive ""freemium"" model. EA has claimed that one can access every element of the game without paying a dime. Want to carve out a block of hard gemstone to make room for your dungeon? That single block will take 24 real world hours to mine (12 hours, if you keep your imps ""motivated""). You have the option to have it completed almost instantly, for 249 gems (which would be about $2.49). Therein lies the problem, either cost in money or time is ludicrous. With the previous example, consider that there at least 12 such blocks between each resource gathering point, and 8 such paths to cut. Doing so would be ideal for dungeon layouts, but at a cost of $480.00, or 1,152 hours, I wouldn't use the term ""free"" to describe it. That doesn't include the rooms, traps, minions, training, upgrades, and spells you would also have to wait/pay for. Let's hope that one day, Mythic's hands may be unshackled.",1
Game just isn't that fun for what it costs to progress. Saving up for a level 4 heart upgrade while constantly worrying about being attacked and losing your resources isn't very fun. The gem costs are outrageous. 4th goblin costs $10+ in gems. No thanks.,1
"EA, if you offerd a versi√≥n without the time blocks that could be purchased upfront you would have my money already, but I will not drop a dime to unlock some progress one day when I know i will just be blocked again the next. This model is reallly not playable/enjoyable in any way. So much potencial here and you crapped all over it.  Sad!",1
Title speaks for itself,1

"One.  Like waiting?  This is your game!  Twenty four hours, 24, yes twenty four, as in a whole day, one day to excavate a single rock tile.   Might as well watch PAINT DRY.  Two.  Micro transactions?  When the cart starts at five bucks, and tops out at 99.99, ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents, they redefine the term MICRO.  Take your significant other out on a date, money better spent.",1
A Dungeon Keeper game by any other name would smell like bile. This smells like money.,5
PvP oriented...but still a good game,4
How do I get my free ringtones,5
Good.,5
This game would be awesome if you didn't dig for a day and get so few gems. Waste of time.,1
,3
"Ignore for a moment the fact that the game is a poor attempt to cash in on Clash of Clans popularity. EA has gone above and beyond to get you to think this is a great game. They attempt to hide any rating not a 5 star by redirecting you in-game away from the play store. Well I won't be caught by that. This game should be quickly dismissed, move on, do not download and do not support EA's attempts to game the play store.",1
Basically u either pay mass amounts of Money to play and Wait for days to make any progress in this... Complete waste of time... So tired of devs tryin to rip people off on a simple android game,1
Its awesome hint don't waste your diamond during tutorial its not necessary,5
"Pay to win/play. They totally nickel and dime you to death, they try to divert all negative feedback to some lame 3rd party site. EA had proven one again that they are all about profit and don't care about customer service or freedom of speech.",1
Unique style,4
It constantly needs to be reloaded and after I got to a certain point in the game I had to restart the whole game. Please fix! I really want to play this game its so much fun! Please fix!,2
It's a cool game similar to clash of clans,5
,1
"It is Dungeon Keeper in a way, but not the game most fans of the series wanted. Every action takes time. And you can avoid the waiting by paying real money. So it can be seen as pay to win as others who invest in it will be further along than someone who does not pay up.   Thankfully I saw a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper in the works called War for the Overworld on steam for those of us who prefer the old games.",2
"The game itself is good but EA's money loving ways completely ruin it (technically the rank should be negative but I guess poor will have to do). That said if have $ 2,000 to spend on only one game then this is the one for you!",1
Such a shame the focused on making insane revenue from in game purchases. Completely ruined an epic classic game. I wouldn't mind reasonable in app purchases but the game is unplayable without them and basically the same as every other real time strategy game only with different graphics -1,1
"It was a fun game, however with every update in an effort to get you to purchase micro boosts they have made everything harder to build. Thus you're taking forever to do anything all the while you're being attacked and your resouces are being cut down. This has gotten worse and worse with every ""update"". Blatant Greed EA! Un installed",1
Fun game.,5
Soooo addicting and fun!  Join my guild: Skar Tactics,5

"Very little gameplay in between exhortations to buy gems.  The pacing seems carefully engineered to make the game unplayable without paying.  I'd have been happy to pay $20 for a mobile port of the original.  If you're looking for farmville with imps, go ahead.  If you fondly remember the original, don't sully those memories by playing this.",1
"Menial things take forever, and cost too much too speed up. It can be played free but you are doing Microgaming 2 mins daily to avoid micro transactions.",2
This game is really fun,5

Fun way to kill time when you can't play games straight through,5
"Downloaded this game to try it out to have something to play while waiting for Clash of Clans and Simpson Tap Out. To my surprise the game is better then both! It has better graphics, excellent voice over! All being free! Get this fellas, you will thank me later. Lol jk.",4

"They literally made the game unenjoyable unless u spend a lot of money and the IAPs are rudiculous. EA used to provide us with not good but great games. Now, they just want their dough like every other greedy developers.",1
Thanks for the game,3
Yall updated but the patch is jacked so now I cant even play wtf. I woyld live to play your game if only it would work.,1
"Nice graphics,  smooth gameplay and connects to the server quickly. Nice tactical game.",5
"I'm making it my goal to push through this game without paying a cent. EA, stop screwing up IPs.",1
I love the original game. This version is bogged down with incorporation of in game purchasing of Gems. Very unbalanced PvP for people who don't want to keep spending real money.,3
Fun game,3
How come to get disconnect when in a battle! Poor server!,1

"I have waited for a Dungeon Keeper game for years, bought both PC versions way back when they first came out.   Positives: Humor still there; amazing graphics for mobile game   Negs: There is far too much micro-management, too many micro-transactions required to really enjoy, takes far too long to load; even though graphics are great, it is almost impossible to see what is happening during a battle.  I'm a huge fan of this franchise, but extremely disappointed.",1
Game was fine then update locked it down,3
Thank you,5
Terrible game unless you just want to sit and wait,1
It seems like the game wants to punish you for not spending money. Yes it's not designed to be continuously played... but the build times should be cut by 75% to keep it interesting.,3
galaxy tab 3 smooth fun game,5
Cool,2
Just sad. Soo many glitches. Game freeze at loading.  Etc. Spend mana on a raid and it disconnects lose all mana spent with no spell experience.  As well as such a huge cost jump to upgrade buildings.  91k rock to 300 thousands for one turret. 100k to 400k for heart building. ....,1
Its not great,3
"The absolutely ridiculous prices in the game make it extremely restrictive. You end up waiting far more than playing, and the pvp aspect almost ensures you will lose enough resources to keep the game from being fun, unless you spend real money.   Having said that: the game looks and sounds great, and does a good job looking like the original. This game would get 10x the money from me if the prices were droped by at least a 5th.",2
"Another great franchise ruined by EA Mobile. This game is great for the first five minutes until you try and do something and realize it's going to take ONE DAY to dig out a block. Having played the old DK games this is absolutely asinine.  The best part is the game continously heckles you to buy premium, gems, or boosts to make the game go faster - it's self aware that it is ripping you off!,",1
Kinda fun but pricey to play. No way to restart your game once started on a Google acct. They MUST implement a dungeon restart mechanism....and soon!,2
,1
I like this game anyone looking to join am active guild join me. Guild: the demonata and rate game 5 stars. Very fun with team work,5
Awesome game slap you stupid minions an tell them what to do!,1
Most ridiculous microtransaction-fueled game I've played. It makes me sad to see Dungeon Keeper this way.,1
Great game been playing it for about a month no issues.,5
I was addicted for about 3 weeks and was saving up to buy my 3rd imp when it of no where I lost virtually all off my gems. I sent something to support but they said I spent them on things in the game. Could not happen. If this didn't happen I would have given a 4 star rating.,2
Such a fun and great twist on a great game,5
Play mechanics ruined by latest update.  Not worth playing anymore.,1
I was so excited when I saw this in the store.  DK was one of my favorite games as a child.  This absolute travesty of a free to play nightmare ruined that fond childhood memory.  Thanks for that EA,1
"Huge battery hog, near constant server communication, means if you are in a raid and you drop signal, all minions and progress lossed. Micro-transactions have ruined the game. Cannot build up queues of work the imps. Game is designed for you to constantly have to open up the app to do stuff. Your dungeon will get attacked twice a day if you don't buy the cave-in spell for some many gems, which are limited and take lots of game time to mine. Which means so many coins right into EA's pockets through micro transactions. More imps are incredibly hard to get. They ruined the game play of the original.",1
"gameplay is prohibitive to promote selling of in game materials or currency. If this game had a more full version, it might be worth it.",2
I downloaded the game for the very first time today and tried playing it but the game kept force closing and when it finally loaded I only got up to the part where I conquered my first dungeon and it force close again I wish it was playable but for now 2 stars and uninstall. It seemed like a fun game at first but I guess I'll have to try again another time  :/,2
Very addictive. Fun game with plenty of options for customising your own dungeon.  Wish they would add a messaging system so one could send private messages to members in their own guild.,5
Not so good,1
The probs are fixed so is my phone oh and if you dont want to pay then dont pay,5
"I want to love this game; seems fun, but be ready to shell out serious cash to do anything. This is NOT the original Dungeon Keeper, not at all; although I wished so bad that it was.",1
"I loved the original and sequel back my younger years. Was so much fun but as with all new games it seems these days, the premium pay to play business model is turning good games into utter crap. Why can't studios just put out a game and charge 10 or 15 bucks. Like Candy Crush I will not pay to play, never mind how addictive it can be.",2
"Pretty good for freemium, but I'd have happily paid for an unrestricted version more true to the original.",3
,1
"The computer game for dungeon keeper 2, was much better.   But I guess this is better than nothing.   I've always loved this game and still play the old game.  ...  If you haven't got the hint yet EA please make Dungeon Keeper 3 already. Oh and this game works just fine on my Android phone to those who've had issues,  try again",4
it wont let me update! !! help!,5
"Unplayable, uninstalled.",1
Amazing !!,5
Another classic franchise dragged through the mud by greedy developers.,1
,5
"I remember this game on PC in 1996 or so, and I think playing that same game now would be more entertaining. It takes forever to build/mine, the imps and minions are not interactive at all, takes a long time to load, upgrades are ridiculously expensive, and the app freezes every time I play. Better waste your time with something else.",2
"Similar F2P setup as other tower defense games but has a lot of thing implemented that give free premium resources.  Best thing about it is the labyrinth style dungeon customization.  Also the game has shorter build times and aspects that get you to check back in more often than once every couple days at higher levels.  It is still young so bear with the few bugs, I havent run into many issues and the ones that I have are easily resolved by closing and reopening the app.",5
I usually don't like this type of game but this one is well done,5
"Using Google Nexus 4: Bugs: (always) * heats phone up A LOT (eating bat fast) even when not actively playing.  (about 1/3rd time) * heats phone up frequently when in background (fails to release CPU) * fails to render imp to start game * fails to connect (progress bar frozen) * fails to render progress bar to start * opens blank screen and doesn't load (all above require force-close to fix) * doesn't report what 1 of 2 imps is doing - you need to click on what it was, and look at the gems count to guess time remaining (250 gems/day)  (occasionally)  * fails to render some graphics  * loses connection in the middle of a battle - AND DOESN'T REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE.  You lose all your minions, mana, etc - basically losing.  Play: Gems system is greedy and irritating, only other option is endless days of delays.  It can take days to complete work, but you have to return every 30 mins (for days on end if you don't spend real money) to cut the delays in half.  Pointless and tedious.     Additionally, once deployed in defense, your minions are brain dead - watching your heart be destroyed rather than walk a few steps to defend it  Out of chars to say more.",1
This game is lots of fun and highly addictive!  I love the challenge of building not on my dungeon but of my minions to beat the snot out of others. There has been only one glitch/downside and that is occasionally one of my minions will freeze and not be available which is annoying.  But it is still a great game.,5
All it is is a server sided money grubbing machine. 1/5 for this....payware,1
,3
It's even better with a touch interface. I dropped it down to 4 stars because of the IAP model. I agree with others who would be glad to purchase a full featured game for $6-$10.,4
This game only needs one word to describe it AWESOME,5
"This is not the dungeon keeper you remember. Even if it used a different IP, I'm not sure how $100 (best value!) is a ""microtransaction"". Sure you can wait... 24 hours to remove one block per imp. Anyway, I couldn't name my dungeon because of a bug and could go no further after ten minutes. Terrible. Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0",1
"Some issues (especially with unfair advantages of people who beta tested this game), but it's a solid game.",4
Just changed stars wirks great now!   just downloaded game get server code 71 error! Why?? Please help. Would like to play. Droid Ultra 4.4,4
could be more fun if it wasn't  so desperate for your money.  unless you pay the ransom you will end up with three minutes of gameplay a day.,1
"Paygates everywhere, worse than tapped out",1
"Fun game. But once I load in it often ""reconnects"" and exits me out So I end up waiting hours for it to possibly work. Very aggravating.",2
What a horrible pay wall! And the way they dissuade you from rating less than five stars is bad for mobile gaming in general. This is not free to play.,1
"The game is great! Good graphic and witty humour. A word of warning, this game requires a little patience. Its not meant to be fast paced, but, for the impatient, you can pay to go faster. The only thing that annoys me, are the login pop ups while the game is starting.",5
The game is great if it weren't for the fact that I have to wait hours to do anything. Of course I could give EA/Mythic a bunch of money to speed things up. Nah.,3
"I never really got to the good part though. Between being pay-to-win and the always-online requirement, I only played about 30 minutes before I was so frustrated that I uninstalled it.",1
This game is designed to get you to spend real money to buy gems that are needed to play the game.,1
"So far, so good. Used to play this on pc, a bit different but I like it so far.",5
These people should be banned of making games like these,1
I played dungeon keeper back in the day and when I saw this my jaw dropped! I'm hooked.,5
Whoever designed the notification sounds for alerting you when something is finished did a great job. The rest of the game feels like a reskin of so many of the social micro transaction games from the last year,2
I'm revolting against micro payment games.  This could be a decent game but ruined by payment model.,1
,1
,5
Won't let me update,1
I spent a solid month on and off of this game and didn't get anywhere...everything in game is expensive and takes forever!,1
"To start off, if you're picking this up due to the name and remember a great game from bullfrog  - don't bother. This game is essentially turn/wait based and designed around micro transactions to get you to buy gems. The game tries to match the dk humor of old but falls short of the dark comedy. Not much real time fast paced action. A pretty boring tap and wait game.  There is also an intrusive push for the game to get your Google profile to see your friends and circles. No thanks.  Extremely dissatisfied.",1
"Unplayable in any real capacity without buying huge amounts of gems. I love the dungeon keeper series, but the micro transactions kill this game",1
"I had to see for myself if it was as bad as they say, and I can confirm that I spent the past week just watching timers. There is no fun to be had here. Only microtransactions. Or months of patience before seeing gameplay. Shame that this was my first introduction to the dungeon keeper series...the originals seemed ahead of their time. This game is a travesty and a shining example of greed. Stay far away.",1

"It did have 5 stars from me but I've run into a couple glitches with building and invading. Sometimes when I hit build, it drains my resources but doesn't start building. Sometime when I invade my minions walk through walls.  All these problems have now been fixed as of 2/18/2014",5
All the in app purchases are awful,1
Takes literally 24 hours of real time to mine one square. The micro transactions are unbelievable and yet another classic ruined by EA. Worst. Company. Ever. Period.,1
the game has change over time and it is for the better,2
Prices for gems to upgrade are not the best. Plus in order to upgrade you need to upgrade other rooms but you need more storage room to upgrade which isn't possible unless you but gems and unfair prices.,1
"It will come to the connecting screen and pops up that it can't connect to server...... so I can't say if the game itself is bad having not played it yet but I am deleting if until you can fix that..... and yes I have internet connection, all my other games that require internet works great. Fix the issue and I'll rate higher.",1
"Just ehh, not getting into finer details just seems like I've played this just now a silly version of ""a narrator"" is directing me subconsciously to my wallet... no thanks.",1
"The only way to move ahead is to recruit more imps.  Imps cost gems, and the only way to get enough gems is to pay.",1
,1
"Everything requires gems to progress so you're limited to 1-3 minutes of gameplay at best before waiting for countdowns to finish.  Game loads slow even on quadcore phones and tablets. Tons of glitches. Actively insults the player under the guise of in-character banter for not paying for things like the $99 gem pack,  (""Maybe if you bought more gems, that wouldn't happen Keeper.)",1
"Freezes up a lot, lots of errors and closes for no reason",1
"I've been playing the two real Dungeon Keeper games for about 18 years now. This is not the sequel I've been waiting for. Not even a good remake or spinoff. EA decided to cash in on the name and a very basic concept. This is nothing more than a cheap, stock game with a few elements of the original Dungeon Keeper games thrown in. It's a repetitive time waster. Most actions take so much time, the game is unplayable unless you start to invest real money to speed things up. I would rather play the originals.",1
"Horrible game ... boring and predictable.  Not to mention settings that are uselessly useless so you can't turn off sound ... when this crap game blasts out some demon voice in the middle of a meeting, even when it's not open, you'll wish you listened.",1
My title captures it. Do not play if u like having money and do not want to sit around for full bloody days just to mine one block.,1
"I'm a big fan of the original game, but the overarching plot at getting cash out of you is sort of annoying. Other than that, it's fun.",3
Fun game,5
,5
It would be better if you could get some helper minions at certain levels or pay with in game cash rather than having to use real money to purchase the gems to get the minions. And some of the building process take a little long. But other than that great game,3
,2
"Nope, all of these pay 100's of $ to play and enjoy games are just f'ing ridiculous.  But companies like EA, do you really need to be part of this?  Oh ya u prob do since your $ maker bf4 is a horrible mess.  Greedy SOBs.",1
"Good game, but don't like the heavy push to buy gems...",4
Pay ea money every time you want to do something or else it takes 24 hours.,1
I would love for there be an option to reset the disposable traps after they have been triggered. Manually setting 15 after each attack is rather tedious.,4
Had my fill of my dungeon getting beat just by using one spell to create a tunnel straight to my dungeon heart. If it wasn't for that the game would be fun.,2
This was a little problem no more internet,1
Fact that it won`t open androids keyboard on my phone,1
,3
"Update: yep! Game is broken! I am unable to build/dig/etc! Uninstall! Not only is this game a poor continuation of the Dungeon Keeper name in which you have to continually fork over money in micro transactions, but the game doesn't even work! The minions consistently glitch and won't dig, upgrade, or build new! The game highlights the object as if it's working, but it doesn't give you any timer because it's never going to finish! Sam Note 3",1
,1
"Gems are to high, imps are to expensive and almost impossible to get all 6 with it in app purchases",1
So far so good.,3
,1
,1
Fun strategy game. Being greedy I would like a few more characters or things to do but it is fun.,5
Its a good revist to the world of dungeon keeper but yet again if you dont wield a mighty credit/debit card you'll be logging into it once a day to set your builders building some contraption that takes 1-2 days. If they find a way to earn gems easier or give us more imps then probably wont get many people playing it.,4
You should download this game,5
This is a very awsome game .,5
I really enjoy the game when I'm not waiting hours or even days to play. Other than that it's cool.,3
"A traditional freemium app, but the welcome twist on the classic tower defense format.",4
"OK for what it is. Several bugs and very slow gameplay, but it has some cool art and good play for a phone game.",3
Once you get into the mindset of entering commands and  then putting the game down for a bit then picking it up later and continuing it really isn't bad.  If you go into this wanting to have extended sessions you won't have a good time.,4
One of my favorite games as a kid is back and on my phone. Awesome.,5
,4
Wanted too much information and wanted too much money.  If you want me to pay for an app fine. Just don't make something I have to pay increments.,1
"Been fun so far, thanks :D",4
The prices for imps were a lot lower. 800 gems for a third imp? Ha!,4
The micro transactions are the worst you will be lucky to get three imps they should cost in game gold not pay-for-play totally ridiculous.,2
Great game but still need work. For instance guild play doesn't allow enough action between members! Not enough information on how the guild works.,4
unique.,5
Basterdization of the originals copy paste of other games and nearly impossible to defend against higher level spells,1
"Though I wish this were not  micro-transaction game effectively costing $100 annually, it's still pretty awesome. Awesome enough to take my attention from the amazing ""Tiny Death Star.""",5
,5
"Sometimes the imps get ""lost."" They're busy but show as free in the upper left, don't show up in the status window etc. Sometimes it's even worse and they are free but you can't do instant actions (building certain traps, clearing non-gem dirt, etc.) It clears up when you go through and cancel other busy imps, but you lose time and half resources to do it.  The game doesn't switch networks well (Wi-Fi to mobile, Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi, etc.) Disconnects in combat. Takes forever to start up. More to say, but out of.",3
,5
,1
"Load time is annoying, considering how often you have to slap your minions. Takes too long to add the third minion. Won't spend money on it yet, until I see a long term play interest.",4
This game brings me back years ago and is super fun,5
,4
"I'm keeping it installed for now, but I will, probably, not keep it.  With times for assignment completion lasting upwards of a day, it takes a massive amount of time to do anything. I was hoping for a mobile version of Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2. Instead it is a typical tower defense game. Really only good for giving something to do while you're bored, yet manages not to cure boredom.",1
The game is great for ppl like me who cant play games all day. I play when I can and when I walk I away I know my minions are working for me. It gets a bit boring when it takes half a dayto a full day waiting on your minions to finish constructing something but u can always pvp or go raid something.  Its fuuuuuuun!,4
Many iap if you want to get anything don quickly,4
Having not paid for any gems yet its taken me a while to get anywhere but its still fun.,5
Really love game play. If you like clash of clans you'll like this,5
The pacing of the game is the antithesis of the original.,1
,1
,4
Cool app,5
Lotsa fun on the run...,5
"They were truthful in saying the game isn't pay to win, but only because there doesn't seem to be any way to actually win.  Lacking the NPC heroes of previous offerings, this instead gives you other players to invade and be invaded by, a fate you can only avoid by paying the premium currency.  If you are incredibly patient, this game could be fun.",3
I plqyit on my ipad and it works reasonably well. Here on andriod I spend half the day shutting down the phone and rebooting. Then it won't  load. Then I updgade something like a mine and I come back to it and its at a 800 cost upgrade again and I did that upgade like 3 before.  It also freezes a minion. So the one that is available actually isnt. My ipad does that as well. Its a fun game when starting out. But frustrating as he**,2
Great game but next to impossible to build a good defense,3
"This is not your traditional Dungeon Keeper game, but it is fun and looks nice.",5
For free it's fun.,5
I enjoy playing,4
You don't have to have a bunch of friends to play and there isn't a huge issue with being farmed to death.,5
"The comments from the minions are awesome. Make the game feel more ""alive"". The spells are fun and relevant to the gameplay.",4
Can't stop playing,5
Cool game. Although it's still just another pay to play. I'd rather it be an upfront cost instead.,4
,1
,5
,4
,5
Great game for spending between 5 and 15 minutes here and there.,5
Good game to check into,5
"Its a fun game, rather slow paced though.",4
Love the classic Game. Reinvented for the tablet. Great Game...,4
"The game is great, a nice time passer but It's half ruined by micro transactions",4
This is a way better game then I thought it was gonna be! When you get more imps they kind of glitch a bit when you're trying to build multiple things at once. But still good.,4
And stuff,5
,5
"Fun, but still suffers from taking too long to do things.",4
,2
Got some corks but runs ok,4
"Way too much time is needed to do actions. It has the right feel in most cases, but it's just not Dungeon Keeper. I bought War for the Overworld instead, and even in beta it's more fulfilling.",1
Rip off.,1
,1
"Congratulations, you got 1 star! If you want more, then you have to pay $4.99 per star",1
"I don't understand all these folks who complain that you must pay to play.  If you have a little patience and strategy, you don't need to pay anything.  My problem with the app is that it disconnects from the EA server frequently, so that in a battle I lose the connection and lose the battle.  I'm on a super-fast wifi network, so the problem is clearly on EA's end.",3
It's really buggy,3
"I used to play this game a lot. The game updates within the app instead of through the play store, which is against android design guidelines and just plain sketchy. Also, pay to win.",2
The only issue I have is the minions and the cost for more. I loved the PC version back in the day this is not same game but it's close enough and lot's of fun.,4
"By default, this game will talk to you. As in, outside of when the game is running. This is amusing at first but when it tells you your minions are ready at 1am, it is really irritating.   Also, if you don't want to spam to the world that you are playing (aka don't sign in with your G+ account) it will irritate you with 2 and sometimes 3 options EVERY TIME you start the game. I'm seriously considering deleting this for this reason alone.  The game, while fun, is more akin to backyard monsters and it's ilk than to the orignal dungeon keeper. The voice work is lots of fun and the game play is pretty and reasonably good. I'm pretty sure this is a pay to win game but I'm having fun without spending the huge $$ right now. If I can get past the complaints above, this would be a 4 star game. As is, the waking me up and irritation upon start drop significantly.",2
Literally can not play unless you spend a boat load of money. Should not be surprised that EA made a other terrible game.,1
,3
Why do you need 99 megabites to play this game I only have 32 megabites,1
I loved the original DK and DK2. Now this pay to play trash has ruined yet another one by selling out what could otherwise be a great game.,2
I do not like that this app switched my ringtone and changed over without my permission. However catchy as it is I work with the public and needless to say my phone going off singing im horny does not go over well in my profession.Update: After logging more hours the game is 80% pay to progress and win.,1
"Ok game but force closes a lot and freezes on loading screen sometimes, servers are slow and don't always load the the most recent gameplay right away. And during raids it reloads to a previous spot in your game, I currently have two separate dungeons going and it swaps back and forth whenever it feels like it.",2
"It's a polished fun game (though not without bugs). On the other hand, the pay-to-not-wait is egregious even by EA's evil standards. I especially like how you get a 50 gem reward for summoning six imps... Which costs well over 5,000 gems to accomplish. Did I mention you have to spend at least $60 to accomplish this? Way to add insult to injury. Uninstalled until the prices and waits are reasonable. (Lol)",2
"This game was really fun and i was into it for about a week, then realized it was impossible to upgrade anything without paying real money",1
a lot of problems and bugs can't load the game right now plz fix,2
Join foolish imp slappers  accepting anyone active,5
"I get disconnected a lot, and it prevents me from playing. Also,  the game seems to be heavily pay-to-play, relying on on micro-transactions. The wait times are ridiculous without paying. Lastly, the game forces me to download an extra DLC, which requires unnecessary additional terms of agreements. I Getty kicked out of the game if I don't want to download it. EA has destroyed the Dungeon Keeper series.",1
Do not install!,1
Hope you like waiting as there is no game here. .. Just a boring way too spend money.,1
"Crashes every few minutes , slow game progression, not the original very disappointed not what I expected",1
"I bought the original Dungeon Keeper on PC way back when and I loved it. I see several of those fun elements here on the Android game, but I also see so many other elements that are just frustrating.  The wait in the game is just killer. On the upside if you so desire you can check your dungeon once in the morning and once and night for a couple of minutes each, and that's it. However, that is not really a fun gameplay; 4 minutes of gametime every 12 hours seems to be some sort of bad design.  I get that it is a freemium model and they want some sort of revenue stream, but I just think they totally missed the boat on it. Heck, I would pay ~ $4.99 if I didn't have to do the overly long weight (seriously, 24 hours to dig out a rock??!!).   Most elements of the game make sense, with limited exceptions. One of these days I'll figure out how the guild thing actually functions. Just kidding. . . I probably won't have enough days for that.  It's a shame. I loved the notion of the original game; be the bad-guy, who can't like that? The mobile version though, is just painful.",1
,5
"You can't realistically play this game without spending money to buy upgrades.  Without purchasing upgrades goals may take two days to accomplish.  Also, when you pay for an upgrade with stone or gold within the game the imp often dies not start the project.  You have to cancel the project, losing 50% of your gold or stone and restart it to get the timer to start.  Very, very frustrating...",2
This is a game designed merely as an excuse to place micro transaction in front of users who loved this franchise. SHAME.,1
"Imps stop upgrading rooms or stop excavating in the middle of their tasks. To cancel the project costs either time, 50% resources or both. Frustrating, feels like a waste of time. Another classic programming debacle brought to you by EA. I'm out!",1
Awesome and amazing,5
Like playing when it runs.  Have to force stop after a couple minutes.  I've tried it on a couple devices and all do the same thing,2
Trying to spend money. But the 20 dollar offer is broken. Need 20 dollar offer. With that makes below happen ;p,4
Don't listen to people saying you need to pay to play cause that's just not true.  You get gems for free and get them as you mine I haven't spent a cent. The public chat and the guild chat is broken since it doesn't show what's been said unless you talk in it making the game very difficult to be social in.  This game has mad potential and is very strategic so it's fun but I don't spend much time actually playing once i've done everything I am done and open to attack.  Other than to slap my imps :-P,3
,1
"I was excited that one of favorite games came to Android.  This version makes me disappointed.  Go to Good Old Games on your pc, pay 5 bucks, and enjoy a timeless classic.  EA will rape your wallet, your privacy, and search your phone for things you don't want them too.",1
"First you ruin PvZ2, and now this and honestly everything you touch. Con artists.",1
"The pay to play method of the game made it get boring very quickly.  Unlike most pay to win games, the grinding need to get the otherwise bought for cash currency isn't balanced enough to be enjoyable.",1
Needs to be balanced more to people not willing to pay for simple enjoyment.,1
Awesome,5
Firget it.  The glutching is costing me money and ruining the game.  It becomes stupid to have to run a raid 5 times to get through it without a glitch.,1
Every time I login I have to play as if I've never started.,1
Micro transactions ruined this game,1
EA has taken what used to be a wonderful PC game and ruined it with this freemium model. Even the original creator of DK is disappointed with this version. I tried to like it.  I gave it over a week of game play hoping it would get better.  I just want to build a dungeon like the classic game. Not wait hours & days for things to finish or worse pay to have this virtual game move faster.  I am uninstalling.  EA says it is built around typical mobile play patterns.  I say typical mobile play patterns suck.  Typical mobile play patterns is a money grab.  If they brought over a game like the classic PC game I would pay for it.,1
When playing if you do not wish to spend cash get ready to be able to get one or two things done a day.  The game is set up so you don't have to buy gems If you don't mind taking four to six times as long to do anything.  I have spent 8 hours with my imps digging.,1
This game is awful the people who made this game did zero work towards the deffensive system u can have an enemy 5ft away from you and youre guards wont attck them.,1
Stupidly slow gameplay,1
"This game as it is now just makes me want to play the good ol' Dungeon Keeper 2. There are bugs a plenty in this version of the game, Imp tracking fails often (as in it falsely reports what imps you have that are free and what tasks they are performing and every once and awhile it will cancel whatever they are doing at that time at the cost of several hours of their work), the touch sensitivity is troubling when it comes to moving traps and doors, you will accidentally dig a great deal of dirt from errant fingertips, oh and the load time is awful but that could just be on my phone. The screen only allows for horizontal on one side (really only irritating if charging your device while trying to play). On to the weirdness that is EA when it comes to reviews. If I wanted to write this review when prompted I would have given it these stars and it would have diverted my review to their private website, not to the google play store where people actually read reviews to decide on downloading.... On to the good side, this game could be great once some simple fixes are made! They are generous with free gems which can also be purchased!",3
,1
Cant even open it to play all it dose is try to connect after ten min of updating,1
"Changed from 5 star to 3. And now 3 to 2. I love the game, i love the quick responses on bug reports. That being said... Holy crap are there a lot of bugs... Warlocks going through walls, imp glitches, random troops popping up. I'm not for a game being released with tons of bugs. Fix and I'll put rate back to 5 stars...... I am so sick of having to uninstall and reinstall this game... I don't know how much data I've used to do it but it's annoying.",2
Has nothing to do with original Dungeon Keeper and is very much of the annoying wait and play style game. Unfortunate.,1
"As it is, this game is way too much of a cash grab. Either charge up front or lower the prices to about 10% of the current level and you might actually see some income. Otherwise the game runs solid and could be fun.",2
"I wanted to like this game. I really did, but the polished execution is ruined by a business decision; fun killing time sinks, designed only to annoy you into giving them more money. The cost of gems compared to what they actually get you is completely out of balance. $10 of gems should buy me an uncrippled game, not just a hand full of skipped time sinks, or a single imp. Until they decide to let this game be fun, just go get the real game from GOG.",1
Woot,5
"Game had too much time built into it. You play for a bit, then wait and wait.",2
"I wanted to like this game, a lot. Unfortunately EA did their best to foul up what should have been an awesome game. I managed to hold my annoyance as, during the tutorial, the game pushed me to use cash items (big screen-obscuring hand pointing at the ""buy with gems"" button at every opportunity). I overlooked the fact that every time I launched the game it tried to get the email address of all my friends via G+. Not to mention the fact that there is precious little to do in this game if you're not interested in paying up. No, eventually it was the regular notification spam that pushed me to finally uninstall Dungeon Keeper from my phone.  So congratulations EA, you took a game that couldn't fail given a modicum of effort, and made it disgusting.",1
Could be much better if it wasn't trying so hard to get your money and just had a flat price to buy.,1
"Even though I didn't expect anything like the initial Dungeon Keeper, I was still disappointed.  The options for dungeon layout are extremely limited, the ui is difficult to use (keep on accidentally picking up rooms when I want to pan), imp behavior is buggy (forgot tasking in me a couple times).  Very frustrating if you aren't willing to pay for the gems.  There are far better examples of the genre.  Add in the shady rating prompt, and you get a 1 star game.",1
It's a terrible and inaccurate rendition of an amazing IP.,1
"Might as well be a piece of bloatware that came pre-installed on the phone, that is how little I enjoy this ""game"".",1
Great FTP game. must have patience. Good job EA,5
,1
"This game can not be played without buying gems with real money. It's near impossible to make any progress. I liked the original PC game and wanted a sequel. I would have paid for an all inclusive single package, but this setup is ridiculous.",1
"you people never learn you have destroyed ultima online and  now you are being greedy again and destroying this classic game as well, sad ,sad and sad. maybe some day you will get it.",1
Terrible money grab garbage.,1
"While this reminds me of the Dungeon Keeper games of the past which I enjoyed, I do not like the fact that you cannot team up to make tasks shorter and when you mine gem veins, it would be nice if you actually get gems.",3
"The game is an amazing recreation however they slowed it down to a crawl without having to use the in game currency.   Unless you like coming back every day to do one thing,  stay away.",2
,1
"Game is actually pretty good, to bad the pay wall ruins the experience for broke people like me.",3
Impossible to play unless you pay for gems and they don't come cheap either. Developer also tricks you away from play store for 1-4 star ratings. Don't bother to install this game.,1
Nope.  I forgot to turn on WiFi a couple of times. every day this thing has an in game update. Ate through my monthly data.  Isn't even a fun game,1
"I miss Bullfrog :( They made some of the best games around. Anyway, the game has a good sense of humor and solid graphics... and there's no doubt it might be a good game, but once again the corporate demands of EA have crapified a once fantastic brand.",1
"Imagine my excitement when I check my email and find an  ad for a new dungeon keeper game.  Then, imagine my disappointment when I install it only to find it is one of those ""free"" to play pieces of trash.  I'm not gonna rant about how that pay model is destroying gaming yada yada yada.  I just refuse to take part in that manipulative nonsense and I encourage everyone to do likewise.",1
:),5
"Took long enough for you to put this in US. Thanks anyway. And for all the QQ about paying to play, if you actually played you'd realize you can get gems simply by digging up rocks. It's how I got goblin 3 and 4. And yes, it's a time based strategy game duh it's going to take a while.",5
"This game had promise. Lots of promise. When you are able to play, it tends to be rather enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty decent. However, whatever fun there was to be had is crippled by the wait times (up to 24 hours!) in an effort to force you to purchase gems with real world money.",1
"As much of a fan of this game on pc, the mobile version is killing me as I get to play it for only a few minutes before having time blocks stop me or urge me to spend money. I'd rather just pay for the game outright than be free to play sucker punched.",1
This game could be the next clash of clans.... but no. It's a great game but it feels really unbalanced since you have to pay to progress fast or even make a little progress.,2
"Like the game but it wont save my progress, keeps rebooting, and it glitches, best part MONEY GRAB PAY TO PLAY",2
"However, whenever the connection to the server is interrupted and the app reconnects I am sent back to the start of the game and have to close out and restart the app to get my progress back",2
Its a good game,4
Everyone knows that this games is out rageously expensive to buy gems i mean don't get me wrong the game is good but to expensive and it also take along time to load up my dungeon make ways to get gems without paying then i will give 5 stars.,1
"*updated* this game has become a huge real money sink in order to now get anywhere in this game you have to buy huge amounts of gems so you can upgrade your rooms, this once fun game has become once again victim to EA greed, now dropping my rating to two stars... I may uninstall soon.  *original post* It's not a bad game but far from the original gem that made dungeon keeper what it is, sadly I wish it had less Facebook game time consuming garbage and more of what made dungeon keeper such an iconic game",2
"The game is fun, but I wish there was a update of the classic game. My biggest frustrations are 1) takes forever to get gems without paying. 2) it is way to easy to accidentally spend said gems with a single tap. 3) if the app looses connection for their servers (EA's issue, not mine) during an exclusive ""challenge"", when it reconnects all of the sudden I have to spend said precious gems in order to play it ""again"". 4) there is no way to communicate with the developer in app to resolve said issues.",2

I would have gave the game a 5 but there is always room for improvement. 1 is I would love it if they added imp customization not for skills and stats or anything but just for the look. Another one is I haven't got everything yet but it doesn't seem like its going to take me much longer to get everything I'm not saying to make it harder I would just like to have more buildings and traps. Lastly adding Guild Wars would be awesome,4
"Entertaining to play. Great narrator. But objectives take days/weeks to attain unless you purchase gems. Beware though, using gems to buy imps and speed up building causes the game to get out of sync. It never knows how many imps are in use and many times I can't access them since game cannot update their availability properly. Save your money and learn patience.",2
"I can't put it down. Great graphics and gameplay. Join my guild ""the sadists"" friendly and everyone is welcome.",5
Horrible freemium crap. Super boring. Super expensive. Double slap in the face to anyone who has actually played a Dungeon Keeper game.,1
The game is fun to play. There is a glitch where you go to upgrade something and you have to cancel it so you lose a lot of currency because it never starts.,3
,1
Money money money and the game seems like its still in beta.,1
"As a long time fan of the series, I'm pretty satisfied with the mobile edition. Of course, if you came here expecting a port of DK2 or something, you will be disappointed.  Pro Tip: Save your starting gems and mine out some more and buy a third Imp. Two is a little limiting, but three is just right.",5
The game is a good game if you have the money. Insted play castle clash it's a better game and you don't have to pay to play.,1
You need more games like this,5
Great game. Should be be a world chat. World chat = 5 star.,3
24 hours for one block and imps cost how many gems? Really? Loved this game on pc.  This is not that game. I'd pay for this app if it was balanced. This takes freemium to an extreme.,1
"Although the gameplay is a bit fun there is a balance that needs to happen between time and money. This does not accomplish the very thing that makes free to play games work. Unlike it takes to long to aquire assets w/o spending money. However, it does incorporate some of the old ""Dungeon Keeper"" game play. It is a bit lack luster to be nostalgic since they made the characters too cutesy and the controls are a bit clunky. Whenever trying to move hit something to upgrade.",2
,2
"When this game started, it was a fun alternative to Clash of Clans; but version upgrades keep increasing the divide between people who have a lot and those who don't by forcing earlier upgrades of the dungeon heart. At this point there's no point in playing anymore because you end up losing more than you make if you're not constantly attacking.  Too bad; it had great potential, but at least now I'll get some room on my phone back and save myself some aggrevation. .",1
You need money to play.  Enough said...,2
end game you need a lot of gems Can't even really play the game,1
Excellent app apparently.,3

"I actually paid to play this game and went back to it after about a week's break and everything I paid for is gone. EA, if u want to keep this game going you better figure something out. I'm guessing a refund for all the money I've spent is out of the question. Let me know what you can do.",1
"After the third time of starting over, I finally gave up.  I don't mind the approach to this game AT ALL.  Truly, I was a fan before and could have been a fan again.  Yet it is too buggy to keep trying out.  Maybe later...",2
EA possibly one of the worst companies next to Comcast and At&t,1
"here's some advice EA  1. stop trying to mine for personal information or behavior habits or location  2. listen to THE  fan base of an established game 3. listen to the original designers and developers of the game . 4. and instead of trying to develop a way to mine your customers pocketbooks constantly  charge 10 to 20 dollars for a solid game , and then charge $5 for expansions .... to a good game    without violating your customers privacy and demanding that you have access to all of ther information",1
Only due to customer service. So once again EA GAMES is holding back on a receipt proven purchase. I purchased a gem pack for 19.99. I have provided 2 receipts. One showing transaction from Google and the other showing the completed funds transfer. EA GOT PAID. I DIDN'T All their response is your request has been updated. How come they just can't give you what you bought?! Customer Always right? Not with EA. You can't argue with receipts. Trust people who make legit purchases. A*******!,1
Bugs fixed so I upping the rating. True to the original and fun but progress is slow and the cost of gems is insanely high.,4
"I loved DK 1&2. I tried to love this game. I really did. Uninstalling it after a few days. This game is an unmitigated disaster. Whoever was in charge of this needs to be fired. It's a betrayal to DK fans, and a mediocre Clash of Clans clone. So much fail. Nice one EA. Way to further cement your reputation as America's most hated company. Reputations matter, and though you will make short term profits off this game, there are long term consequences to such short sighted greed.",1
,1
This is a p2p app. Skip it,1
"I wish this were the Peter Molyneux game.. it's not the old Dungeon Keeper by any means and is a naked money grab.. they designed it for a certain play style.. they didn't design this game for original DK fans, and not continuous pay unless you got the $$$.. no thanks. Sell me a $2.99 game and I'll gladly pay.. but not this buy gems crap.  Sad.",1
Terrible. #invest2win,1
"Fun to play, but way slower than the original DK. Either pay to build quickly or wait. A lot. Can't manipulate monsters at all, the just stand around doing whatever.",2
Oh and there rating gate from in app ratings survey.,1
The game decided to reset it self and take all the gems that I had payed for the game was fun until that happened.,1
"How about actually making a good game instead of mechanisms to take people's money.... The saddest part is that EA has some of the best talent in the industry yet they are forced to make things like this disguised money collector. (One could even considered it malware...) It is akin to asking Michelangelo to paint stick figures. Make a great game and people will buy it, don't try to nickle and dime them. :(",1
A little bit of in game cost would be fine. But once into figuring the whole thing out (it's not the same of the old DK games but that didn't bother me as much as some others) and being willing to throw some money at the game you quickly figure out how far your money doesn't go. I have four imps a 5th would cost me almost $20 real life money.  That is insane. Mine enough gems or through raids good luck. The imp costs 2100 gems and a typical task nets you 5 whole gems.  Bottom line too much $$$,1
Takes to long to dig and build,1
"Wow they got almost 25k shills to 5 star this abomination, impressive.  Theres a reason youre winning the golden poo every year above companies like bank of America, EA.  This horrible rape of a childhood memory is no exception.",1
If you liked the games that bull frog made  don't download this game. I'm UNinstalling it now. I would have gladly paid for the old game on a mobile platform .,1
"I attempted to make a purchase for gems through the app. I was billed for the purchase and when I returned to game, it said my purchase had been canceled. They took my money and gave me nothing in return. Thrives.",1
,5
Need to pay constantly to play. Bullshit.,1
"This game screams pay to play right from the beginning.  You'll find that unless you pay, the game will become near unplayable as wait times become ridiculously large.  Also don't be fooled by the four star rating.  EA has it set so that writing a negative review is much more tedious than simply giving the game 5 stars.  In other words, don't get this game.",1
"Some call these games pay to play, but really it's pay to progress to more expensive payment. EA ruins another game.",1
"Loaded the app one time, constant notifs ever since. Why would I care about a double bonus on a game I never finished the tutorial to? Just uninstalled.",1
Huge money grab. Game hinders people from reviewing it with less than 5 stars unless you come here specifically which is why it is still rated highly. You will end up getting destroyed by people who payed within a week of playing it guaranteed.,1
,1
"Shouldn't be tied to the dungeon keeper genre, very different and just trying to pinch you in the nostalgia.",2
"Sad comparison to the original Dungeon Keeper games it takes 24hours to clear one block. I remember spending hours building a dungeon. This is just sad. It plays like this, start the game, click on a building to update or wall to dig, see that it will take HOURS, click and close game, repeat tomorrow. Sure you can attack other dungeons, however it seems bland.  Nice try but a fail.. Uninstalled it after a week.",1
"I downloaded this after hearing all of the controversy,  thinking ""it can't really be as bad as they say can it?""  And I've come to find...that my last week and a half have fit the delays perfectly.  Now, part of the game is optimizing time - so if I wasn't thinking about time strategically then I'm sure I'd be frustrated.  But the same applies to any strategt game.  But the theme is great and takes me down memory lane.  The battles are  much more engaging than they were in the 90s.  And I have spent $0.00.",5
"If you didn't know EA is all about getting your money but I actually like this game despite the digging taking 2 hours minimum, and 800 gems for another imp, gathering resources is a lot easier when you take it from other people. What makes me give this game 2 stars is this glitch where after I attack someone it takes me to when you first start the game.",2
"I played through the tutorial of this game expecting to hate it. And I did. The time it takes to do any action in this game is unbearably long. Not to mention EA Mythic is totally fine with hamfistedly saying ""yeah, don't worry about anything. Use gems."" EA has destroyed what could have been a great game in pursuit of a quick money grab. Horrible game. Do not buy",1
It is fun,2
,5
The cost to upgrade things is bizzare... Its like they messed up... It seems like you would need 200 or 300 dollars to get anywhere in the game. Its such a joke. I will re-rate when EA can fix this glitch,1
I was a huge fan of the series and mourned the axing of DK3 (though the torch was picked up and War for the Overworld had been made). 3 stars for now until I deem it worthy of its heritage. Update: I too have beef with this gem system. You should of made it a pay up front game instead of ruining what could of been a excellent reboot of the franchise. The imps are useless and how do you lose all your minions after a mission you won? I could go on but it would be in vain as EA/Mythic doesn't care.,1
"The micro transactions ruin an otherwise average title. If you played the original you will be disappointed. Looks like dungeon keeper, sounds like dungeon keeper but does not play like dungeon keeper. I would have purchased this title outright instead of dealing with the stupid transactions.",2
Instead of recreating a great. game this is more like a tutorial on how to ruin a game by turning in to a frustrating pay2win revenue stream. Pure garbage.,1
impossible to do anything without paying,1
"Until you spend all your free gems. You will never have 1/10th that much again unless you spend $$$. Game is slow after that, very slow, very un explanatory and ridiculous level up systems,",1
"Also, too many microtransactions",1
"There is almost no gameplay to speak of in this reboot of a classic franchise. Expect to pay if you don't want to spend several hours completing any minor action. The art direction is visually pleasing, but that's about the only thing this load has going for it.",1
Take a look at some of the others' reviews and you will see that those who have played the original Dungeon Keeper see the cost of gems as a total rip off.  You can only play the game for a few minutes then you will have to wait for a hours before you can get any further... unless of course you purchase more gems for more playing time.,1
"I'm one of the rare few who is both a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper and plays a lot of f2p games.  I'll pay for content if I think it's worth while... but this is not.  They try to use the irreverent humor of the original to poke fun at it, but they fail in the humor department as well.  Hopefully someone will make a new game in the spirit of the original.",1
"I'll start by saying at first, I loved this game. Now, however, the plundering system has ruined it for me. Do not play this game if you don't like the idea of having what money you've spent taken from you by players who have spent much more time and hundreds of dollars more than you.  An example:  1. You buy enough gems to make a large purchase of Stone or Gold. After you buy the resource, it goes into your storage.  2 . Another more powerful player is allowed to then plunder that resource. $=Lost",1
"The ranged makes are able to partially if not entirely walk through walls, please fix that as I know it's not intentional",1
"You can not do anything in this game in a reasonable amount of time without the game BEGGING you to pay. It even starts in the tutorial, after the typical pay to play speech about ""you can spend money to speed up 'X' process"", a giant hand points at the pay button and won't let you continue until you click it or wait for the ludicrous timer to run out. This continues through the whole game. I kept waiting for ashton kucher to pop up and say I just got punk'd...",1
"I've played Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2. While this isn't a bad adaptation of those games, I'd recommend highly that you don't get this game - it's a huge money-grubber that requires you to pay for most everything. If you find this game and really like it, I highly suggest getting the original PC games - don't waste your money on this.",1
"While I love the motif the pvp isn't optional. This means those who pay will not only be able to beat you, but they can steal the resources you have been saving up for a costly upgrade. I don't mind a mobile game that requires wait times to play, but this game is practicly unplayable without paying for Gems. I also ran into a bug where the imps can't start any new work even though they don't have current jobs. I had to wait several hours before I could assign them work. This happened four separate times",1
EA does it again. Greeeeeeed.,1
"Great and typical ""build, collect and farm game."" It goes without saying.... ""Not as good as the original but could be a great game.... IF EA wasn't out for dollars. For instance, to level your Dungeon Heart to 4 you have to have 20k stones, and what's that? Your warehouse for stones tops off at 19500 capacity at level 4...That's called nickle and dimming folks. The rate for more than two Imps, I mean really.... 800 gems. Could a company that reaps millions be any more greedy??? TOO greedy for a great *f2pG",2
,1
I downloaded app got so far  in game process then it restarted on me I paid $21 to get gems and now I have to start all over. Big rip off,1
"Even for paying players. And if you wanna enjoy thus game past the 1st coupke days,  get your $$$ ready.",1
"It's just another timer and micro transaction based game like all the others, but with a Dungeon Keeper skin. Not at all like the original and not something I want to play. I would have gladly paid up front for a new, playable Dungeon Keeper. It's also suspicious that it had almost exclusively 5 star reviews when it was featured and so many 1's since it went up...",1
Im less concerned about the atrocious gameplay than by the deceptive and manipulative user feedback system.,1
Bull crap,1
Free to wait game. This is an abomination to the Dungeon Keeper series. Everything takes time to build ranging from hours to days unless you pay up. Pay features are crammed down your throat at every turn including playing through the tutorial. Game needs to offer a pay once feature for the full game not this ridiculous nonsense.,1
Pretty bad,1
"It is slow to dig etc at high levels, but it's good for playing here and there. Good graphics, and I enjoy the style.",5
The entire play experience is stupid. Not fun at all unless you pay out some serious cash. What's even more offensive is that this is a remake of a beloved game. EA has butchered what is seen as a classic to many people.,1
"Pay 2 play garbage. This is almost a scam, can't even game over, just lose progress so you can pay more! Guess you'll never learn, EA",1
"This has potential to be a fantastic free to play, however, if you want to reel people into this game halve the time it takes to do things if not more. You have an audience that wants immersion and you increase the competition factor when you oblige that nature. You developers need to scream at, and show, those above you what the ramifications are when you tax your audiences with little reward.",3
,1
This game is just a pale mockery of the original. The original Dungeon Keeper was better than this.,1
"Great throwback to the old game. However, the in app purchases are ridiculously over priced, as well as the constant time constraints are excessive in many cases. You would have been better off revamping it to be more in line with the old game play. [UPDATE]  I've now had to remove one final star due to the fact that the game play is so buggy. It's bad enough that you need to wait days for some things to finish... Now it doesn't even update the imps availability correctly.",1
Lol,5
Original game much better.  Free to play takes fun out of game.  Times to accomplish things take too long.  Had hi hopes but deleted...,1
Wonder why the game has four stars? Reviews done in-game aren't sent here. Pay to play,1
The game is to slow to play without paying shiz loads of money,1
"POS game, gives a bad name to the original in every way possible.",1
So cool I'm so cool it Is cool I'm  so cool,5
"For all its great features, the core game and interface are buried under a microtransaction scheme that is designed to milk players for money in every aspect of the game. You cannot simply play this game, you must pay for the privilege or face crippling throttles and barriers to gameplay.",1
Big time,1
They want you update!!! Also want your money $$$ ¬£¬£¬£ !!! Im not happy.  I dont want update. I decided I already delete this game. I mean uninstalled!!!!  Bye...  game over ! I recommend you go get it on your PC !!!!!,1
"I cannot fault them for wanting to make money.  Like many games, it is pay or take a long time.  I think the people complaining about to cost need to mellow out.  Sure, it would nice if there was a cheep option, but it isnt like some games where it is impossible unless you play.  There is one bug.  Sometimes, when you set your imps to work on something, they dont appear to be working.  There is no count down, but if you try to assign them to something else you are told they are busy.",4
"Another build/wait, rush/pay game.  Smallest gem package is $5.  Why do devs keep using the farmville model?",3
Bullcrap,1
"Agree with the comments about being difficult to play without making purchases.  Graphics are good. Compared to other similar style games, you definitely hit a wall quickly where you are just forced to wait for hours, even days just to build something.  Have to open the game once every half hour just to slap imps and attempt to speed up building, but once youre in you cant do anything.  Havent found a solid guild at all, hard to communicate/help/get help from guild.  Game needs lots of work to compete.",2
"It's a shame that it came to this. Dungeon Keeper was a great PC game, and could been a perfect fit on tablets. Graphical update, minor tweaks, then charge $5-10 for it. I would've bought it. A lot of people would have. Instead we have this F2P garbage that starts rooting around in your pockets within minutes of installing. This is, essentially, a greedy Clash of Clans rip off with a Dungeon Keeper paint job. Except they forgot to copy the fun and spirit of either.",1
In order for you to play this game how it should be play you will end up paying a lot of your money... thanks but no thanks EA,1
Love the original PC version. Too much flashy graphics just to build/upgrade. Moving around the screen isn't smooth. They make it so you can easily accidentally spend your gems.,2
Typical EA stealing from gamers!,1
I'm rating this game 2 stars because it is fun but it is one of the most greedily priced ftp games I've seen on the app market. The cheapest option for gem purchase is 5 dollars and that isn't even enough buy your second imp. The game is very addicting and fun but the sheer wait times either force you to pay for gems or get only a few minutes of gaming in per hour. I would happily give ea money and support this great game if it wasn't so blatantly greedy. Fix the pricing model and I'll give you some money,2
"Don't truck people get again, EA",1
It's a pretty good game I loved the original dungeon keeper on ye olde windows. The 90 dollar gems or as they put it best value is actually not the best. If you get two 40 dollar and the 10 dollar one you actually get more!! I learned this the first day I played. So not only is it pay to win they have false advertisement about the best value. Really the most expensive gems should be 10 dollars it's stupid to expect people to pay anything over 50 for a free phone game.,2
"I wish it didn't cost so much to buy stuff, otherwise I just may.",3
"Lots of noticeable bugs. Fails badly at being ""Dungeon Keeper"", instead goes after the abused clash of clans model and doesn't even do a good job at it.",2
,2
This game is insulting and unethical. Just go play the old games on GOG.,1
Go online and get the original PC version for free and save yourself the grief of this game,1
The game is beautifully done ..however they make you pay to do everything if not you are stuck waiting 4 hours to dig one brick ..some are up to 24 hours ...not cool ea..,2
"EA was just trying so hard to copy clash of clans it's truly sad. Don't waste your time with this beyond stupid app. They just try to get your money. At least clash of clans is worth it. Better put together app, don't need money, and super fun.",1
As title says.  Just get black screen.,1
Try to build something without paying,1
"If you want to even win at this game you have to spend huge amounts of money because you cannot take your resources and turn them back into gems, a thoroughly disgusting exploitation I'm not against anyone making money but this is just beyond greedy!",1
To even sort of play you need to pay... Its so sad because I used to love the old one... EA and their money its so silly,1
Game makes you wait 4 hours to mine something...or pay real money to mine instantly. Instantly uninstalled.,1
F@#$in waste of time,1
,4
Do not buy.,1
"If you have money to spent on this game, just do it. If you dont, dont install this app. To mine a gem ore takes 24h, to mine another 4h, to build or even upgrade takes hours too, some traps dont. If you want to go faster in everything, you will NEED TO PAY REAL MONEY to get things done faster. So DONT INSTALL THIS",1
"While I love the concept and the game play, the way they get you to pay is through time. Even the most simplest of actions will take hours to complete without spending gems. Just beginning I would do 3 or 4 actions then have to wait. Makes it unbalanced for the people that don't want or can't afford to pay. It is easy for someone to pay just to become the top player by ensuring they don't have to wait to complete actions.",1
"This game has potential, but the micro transactions make it unplayable. Waiting 13 hours to break a stone block is ludicrous!",1
"So I've played this for a bit with little issues, but tonight everything broke. Might want to fix that.",1
Don't even think to download it.,1
this was one of the coolest games for the pc.. but to see what they did to it is sad really.,1
,5
"This game has a great idea behind it, but the execution leave much to be desired.  I understand the idea of a free-to-play game having microtransactions, but this takes it to a whole new, dark level.  When it takes hours to perform basic functions, it's no longer a microtransaction, it becomes paygating. For example: Expanding your Dungeon; what genius thought 4 to 24 hours to clear one space was a good idea?  Take out the paygating, and this game becomes infinitely more playable; maybe even a 4-5 star app.",1
"I've played the original and its good, but this is a bad remake for mobile. I understand the turn based operations and the pay, pay, pay as you go aspect. But wow what a let down I changed my rating from 5 to 1 stars. I hope EA is paying attention and reading the message boards. Like everyone else. I would pay $5 - $10 dollars for an actual game. This was just lazy.",1
Let me pay one flat rate! EA's business model will be the second fall of gaming!,1
"Too many time blocks, and a poor Dollars-to-Gems exchange rate.",2

"The entire game is pretty much behind a pay wall. Every few steps it'll ask you to pony up real money.  All EA games are garbage, and this one is no exception.",1
Ahhhhhhh,4
"Could have been a very good game, but the ""micro transactions"" are completely out of balance.   To play past the first level or two, be prepared to pay through the nose. $25 is the ""popular"" buy in cost, but you could easily pay $50 or $100 to play through. No thanks.  Its not a triple AAA PC or console game.",2
Tricking users for 5 stars?  Screw that.,1
Fraud,1

Doody,1
Terrible water downed greedy grab for cash through microtransactions. EA needs to stop ruining everything they touch and just die already. EA greedy corporates execs are ruining games.,1
"This app is awful. Can't pay, can't play",1
In app review link redirects away from play store if user indicates they will review fewer than 5 stars.  Do not trust the review score of this game!,1
"I really enjoy this game. But the way you've structured it I'll never pay a dime. I'm happy to plod along, gradually collecting loot and building my dungeon. It's a ton of fun and is a perfect blend of building and strategy. However I won't be buying any gem packs since they're horribly overpriced. If this game was for sale at $10 or $20 for an ""unlocked"" version with infinite dig speed for imps, I'd be happy to pay. As it is, I'll continue to enjoy this great, free game.",5
Greedy game. No offline capability and required to $pend to advance/play if you don't want to wait for days. Uninstalling.,1
"Will not load for days at a time.  All I get is ""won't connect to server"". Dont waste your time installing",1
"I will tell the imps to dig or upgrade something, the building or dirt will turn blue but the imps won't work. Even up top or the imp screen will say they arent working. Exit and reload 10 or so times, they will finally work, but them come back later and they aren't working again. Makes it really hard to play.",2
What a disgrace for the gaming industry.   Can't do anything fun without shelling out the credit card.   Time to step it up.,1
Worst game ever made. Pure greed,1
"My rating would be better but, the prices for gems are a bit outrageous. It's a good game to pass time with but some of the waiting times need to be toned down...allot. It takes ten minutes to upgrade your dungeon heart but three hours to mine a regular gem block. Please tone down the time to wait. And please reduce the time to mine and upgrade your dungeon heart.",3
"Was a huge fan of dungeon keeper 1 and i liked 2 Was all excited for this because dungeon keeper could totally work on mobile But no not only is it f2p it is offensively greedy, 24 hour wait times on some blocks Bulllcrap This is a sad day for gaming",1
"Do not trust the star rating, EA tricks users into only giving this 5 star reviews.",1
"This alleged game is a pathetic mockery of the Dungeon Keeper name.  It is the worst kind of money grabbing grindfest game.    The worst is the way they try to cheat the rating system.  Didn't work on me, I'm giving it the 1 star it deserves.  But only because I can't give it a lower rating",1

STOP MAKING THE SAME FORM OF GAME OVER AND OVER like hero clash and now one of my former all time favor it games reduced to this ""dungeon keeper"" they all suck even if I pay to play witch will never happen",1
"Just when you think Electronic Arts can't possibly be any more malicious, conniving and underhanded, they pull something like this from their collective hindquarters. May the entirety of the development team and their superiors be damned to the deepest, most painful level of Hades for all eternity for besmirching a beloved brand like Dungeon Keeper in order to continue their shoddy, anti-consumer business practices.   That said, it was quite big of EA CEO Andrew Wilson to allow them to use his baby picture as the game's icon.",1
The basic gameplay is fun at first but you quickly end up in a state of constantly waiting for your imps to get done digging or building which can take hours or days.,3
"EA continues to be the most corrupt, most clueless company in the video game industry. Does it come as a surprise? No, but still worth noting.",1

"Unplayable unless you have a lot of money or even more patience. Forces a survey on users that don't rate 5 stars... leading to an artificially inflated score.

Takes a dump on the Dungeon Keeper legacy by combining it with Clash Of Clans. Happily deleting,1

It can take up to two days just to do a simple task and a 100 bucks to move things along is just nuts.  Besides this, the bones of a really great game are here.  One I would love to pay a reasonable amount of money for.  Here is hoping Ea fixes this, cause then I think we will have something really special.",2

"Spending money constantly is the only way to make this ""game"" actually a game. 4 hours per block for about half the map when you need space to build and make traps= unplayable.  Decent idea ruined by greed.",1
"It has so many glitches, it's difficult to play.  I understand why EA has had to chat the Play Store ratings to get over two stars.",1
Requires cash investment,1
"Another perfect example of a potentially great game DESTROYED by unreasonable IAP. I've never paid $100 for a console game, how could you possibly think it's OK in a mobile game?? Don't waste your time on another EA cash grab. Sincerely, SCREW YOU EA!! Pathetic..",1
Love it can always cheer up after slapping minions,5
,1
The game starts nicely and then slowly it starts to take longer and longer to build.  You sign in once in a while only to find you have been robbed.  Of course you can fix it all by spending hundreds of dollars... On a game that should cost only 10.,1
"But it's a great throwback. Update: takes too long do anything,notfun, very disappointed.",1
As soon as I opened the game the ea insignia popped up then it started to shake and everything went black now I can't play. Wow u guys suck at games!!!! &gt;:(,1
"Turns a great old game (it's free today on gog dot com btw) into a crappy tower defense game that charges you for any and every advantage..  If you don't pay for gems you are unable to progress..  it's also very cumbersome to play, and your monsters are retarded they don't do anything to help unless they stumble over the enemy..  In the original you could pick up the monsters and move them where they needed to be..",1
B a d boo5 p,1
The IAPs are really getting out of hand. Restricts you from having fun unless you've spent nearly $100 on IAPs.,1
This game really should have just cost some money upfront rather than the outrageously expensive microtransactions.,1
Ugh love the game till the constant rate me pop ups. Uninstalled,1
"I am so disappointed... As a big fan of the (really old) pc version of this game I was excited to see it as an app. But then I fell from the clouds. If you are not willing to be spending at least $5 a day, you will never enjoy this game. Too slow with many limitations just to make you pay up for credits. Pfff, thanks EA.",1
Waaaay to long wait times and super expensive to do anything.,1
,4
EA once again shows how terrible they are.  Their blatant attempts to keep any negative reviews from reaching the play store by funneling them away to EA itself rather than posting to Google Play is despicable.  That alone would be enough for a 0 star review (if only that were possible).  Add in the terrible in game purchases and inability to enjoy the game without forking over absurd amounts of cash and this game is a complete write off.  EA can get bent.  Support indie developers.,1
Always,1
Interesting game dungeon crawl and city builder. Bad EA for forcing users to rate a 5. Retarded in game purchase system that is expensive. Don't let your kids play.,1
This game was created to make money by holding back ALL of the fun. Its impossible to make any progress without buying lots of gems. Why start down that long frustrating expensive road?  Uninstalled. Go get DK2 for PC.  And how slimy is the way they gate the reviews? Yuck.,2
,3
"I can handle the pay to play format.  I can even handle the long wait times.  What I can't handle is the latest update that has caused major problems in this app.  The imp count isn't correct,  I can't build new rooms and the room that I started 5 DAYS AGO is STILL in progress without any end time in sight. This needs to be fixed ASAP. I loved the original Bullfrog game.  Still have it and was willing to give this one shot.  But not anymore.",3
,1
"Dungeon keeper, as a concept and stylistically, is great. Unfortunately, making it freemium, and time-locking all of your progress in the game, turn what could be a fun diversion into a miserable, Farmville-meets-tower-defence experience. If I could just pay a $2-5 one-time charge and just play the game without any of the micropayment BS, I would have given this game at least two more stars. As-is, the game is terrible.",1
Every time you do an action the game is begging for gems to speed it up. 24hrs to mine a wall. 12hrs to upgrade a hatchery. But for real money you can make it go away. Back to my old DK2 for my keeper fix,3
"Yep, another one of these games I played in my younger years completely ruined by the ""Mobile style"" of play with In App Purchases that absolutely feel mandatory to play more than a couple minutes at a time.  I WANT MY DUNGEON KEEPER BACK!  Only EA could screw this game up this bad.  If you want to download this because you loved Dungeon Keeper 1&2, TURN BACK NOW, This is no longer the Dungeon Keeper you knew!",1
"This is basically a scam. It is not a game with a crash bug, it is a crash bug that happens to include a game. The only reason they have 25k 5 star reviews is because they manipulate you into giving them. Do not spend ANY money in this game.",1
The mechanic of this game that prevents players from advancing is to have blocks that take 10 times longer to mine than the ones next to them. This is a sorry excuse of a dungeon keeper game.,1
Not even worth the time I spent downloading.,1
Original is miles better,1
,2
"This level of micro transactions really destroyed the gameplay, and this makes it only a reboot to the originals for graphics nothing else. And that is still very far off",1
Been waiting for this! Awesome,5
At some point one has to think why people keep on buying games from a company like this.,1
"Its like clash of clan but more fun and I love the devil guy. Great dialogue. Sfx is amazing. But its filled with problems. Always lags, always reconnecting after extended gameplay. So hard to move things. Hard to switch rooms and buildings. You should update with store and redesign mode Like clash of clans. And the revenge system is flawed, when I click revenge, I actually want to destroy the guts who wrecked me not some random person.",2
Rating in game only allows you to rate it 5 stars.  1-4 star ratings get taken to a followup form to EA which never gets posted on Google Play.  You have to find the app in Google Play to give it a legit rating.  Constant pay to play.  I'd rather buy a game up front than get nickel and dimed for almost everything under the sun.  What else should I have expected from EA?,1
Another great game ruined,2
"Apply either label, or rename the game dungeonkeeperville and sell it to zynga.. couldn't get any worse.",1
"You hit us with pay to play freemium bs, you make it difficult to properly rate your games as garbage, and expect no backlash. I truly hope your company fails hard.",1
You cant advance without paying with micro transactions...and as of now it stopped working as well..it crashes with a black screen..,1
"Are you a fan of tower defense and real time strategy? Then move on, there's nothing here for you. Apparently the developers took the ""real-time"" aspect a bit too seriously, since some operation can take up to 24 hours to complete. What little gameplay there is, is slow and tedious. The constant desperate cash grab to buy gems is appalling, and the game as a whole is not enjoyable. I'd rate it lower, but the store doesn't allow anything less than 1-star.",1
"EA, you may think you have the upper hand... but your efforts are obvious and are spread across all the blogs and news reports. Trying to manipulate the scores only accents the desperation of your 5 star ploy. We'll play your game, on our terms.",1
The game's overall presentation is great and it plays nicely.   It's really just a clone of Castle Clash branded using the classic PC game.  The constant need to buy a few more gems in order to play at a reasonable pace is too frustrating to just get over. It's like a slot machine.  Really disappointing pay model.,2
Horrible whole point is so you spend money,1
"Congratulations EA. You have earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $5.49 each.  But seriously, this game is pay to win trash that disrespects the original Dungeon Keeper license. Avoid at all costs.",1
The game asks players how they would rate the game. Only answering 5 take you here to rate it. Otherwise feedback is sent to EA *directly*.,1
Horrible pay-to-play concept that benefits EA only. Terrible reboot of a once great series. Down with EA's tyranny!,1
This game sucks. EA should be ashamed.,1
"Positive: Good game, great throwback to the old DK.  Negative:  Crashes.  A lot.  Way, way, WAY too much.  Which is doubly annoying when you're doing well in a raid, and then lose because the game crashed.",3
More EA micro-transaction crap.,1
,1
There's a reason why ea is the worst company in two years in a row,1
"While there are certain parts of the game that make it feel like the dungeon keeper of old, the time it takes to do anything quickly makes that nostalgia fade away. I was hoping to get a game I could sit and play for a good amount of time when bored or waiting at a doctor's office. However, what we got was an app you can give a few commands and after 5 minutes at max, you cannot do anything but close it and wait. The simple fact is things take too long unless you pay a considerable amount with no end game.",1
"I loved the original Dungeon Keeper, and enjoyed the second one. Playing this was like digging up the grave of an old friend and punching them repeatedly in the face. EA, you've gone too far this time. Games are supposed to be *fun*.",1
Would be nice if you didnt have to wait so long to do everything,3
"Just terrible. Take a classic, make it unplayable without spending significant amounts of cash, and ruin the hopes and dreams of millions. If this is EA's new game philosophy, count me out of anything they make.",1
Tried to play... Then I got bombarded with transactions.,1
Also doesn't help that the game only let's you rate this 5 stars if in app.,1
For shame,1
,1
Not really fun and the pay to play goes over the top.  Many people would gladly pay a few dollars up front rather then the current scheme.,1
Join Demonic Killers! ;-),5
It's like they slapped the name on another project so they could attract more people.  A poor clone of Clash of Clans.,1
"I loved DK 1 & 2, in fact I still play 2 because it's so good. So I was thrilled to see that they finally made an up to date sequel. That happiness quickly faded however as I tried this. The only redeeming quality about it, is that they got the original voice actor to do the new sound bites. The play control is just barely an RTS, as most digging takes hours, not seconds. You also only get 2 imps without farming for days or paying. All rooms are prebuilt, no custom sizes or hidden elites. And monsters disappear after battle, unable to be used again. After 15 minutes of tutorial and beginner play, I could go no further and realized that they designed this to be pay to play/win. Shame on you EA for ruining a classic!",1
Eating should be banned from play store. I'm only able to keep this app only if it give it a perfect score?!,1
,1
poor,1
Between incentivizing high ratings and filtering out low ones... This game deserves the worst rating I can give.,1
Only the pictures are dungeon keeper like. Game play is just a wait and click game...,1
And it tricks most users in to giving five stars.,1
"Micro transactions are not a substitute for actual game development. Earn your money, don't scam people out of it.",1
Could be more fun.,2
Make me miss the pc version. But only want one time consuming game.,3
If you're not willing to pay for gems it's literally impossible to play the game,1
Pay to play or delete it. Those are your two options,1
EA doesn't like customers,1
I'm a huge fan of castle defense type games. I was very excited with this variation. I tried 10 times to get through the tutorial and every time my phone would time out or freeze. Quite disappointed.,1
"Well, it started out fun but gets boring very quickly. More payware from ea",2
Rubbish tactics but what many have called the worst company in the industry. The CEOs at EA don't care about their customers as much as their corporate pay check. This behavior from EA must end,1
No thanks,1
Plagued with micro transactions and a dependence upon them. The original developers from Bullfrog must be ready to commit suicide after seeing what EA has done to their classic masterpiece.,1
"Aside from the fact that that this game is a complete money scam on EA's part, they aren't satisfied with just taking your money. No sir! They want your identity too!  Not just a little bit of it. ALL of it!  They want to know all your contacts, other apps you use, the identity of other machines on your network.  The list of things they acquire in the name of ""market research"" is downright appalling.   If you insist on playing this game, install it on a tablet that has a clean slate, and uses a dummy account, & connect to an isolated network.  As for game play, it would actually be fun if they didn't make it so incredibly slow if you don't pay to get gems. (seriously guys... 1 day to mine a single block? Oh, but you can ""rush"" the job by paying with gems.  How do you get gems? Easy. You pay cash for them!)  The other part that absolutely sucks is the mandate to be forever connected to the internet to play.  There is NO offline game play.  Besides, why would they offer that?  Then you couldn't provide all their valuable market data!  It could have been a good game. But, EA completely destroyed the possibility of that happening.Too bad. I liked the old DK series.",1
"You bring a bad name to everything related to video games. Maybe instead of scamming your customers into false rating and in app purchases, you should put out quality games. Also, maybe people will stop pirating your games if you open it to the modding community, allowing for the game to be extended and more exciting. Just look at the success Valve and Bethesda have found with that strategy. Please change.",1
"This game is not true to the original game at all. I cannot believe they would think this is acceptable. If you really want to play Dungeon Keeper on Android, download DOSBox and the Dungeon Keeper iso.",1
Lots of waiting and in app purchases sum up this experience.,1
Wow.,1
"Excavating one block of soil can take up to 24 hours and getting more than two imps requires money, might be fun to play for 2 minutes a day.",1
"Game is great, minus the p2p bs, but slow and steady makes for a raiders dream. My biggest complaint is a major glitch where I start  an imp on a task and the task initiates, but the clock never starts. So I end up having to cancel the task and loose half my invested materials (200k worth and counting). Major bummer, makes me really not want to shell out the real ducketts for a seriously flawed game.",2
This game is a perfect example of how much ea wants to rob you. Steer clear.,1
A plus,5
Gameplay sucks.,1
Way to ruin a good game EA.,1
"It makes it hard to rate less than 5 stars, and incentivizes rating high.",1
EA is such a terrible company. This game is a pathetic port of a great game that doesn't allow any sort of progress without paying for it. And trying to stop users from giving the game a bad rating? Disgusting. I would give this game negative stars if I could.,1
"Classic bait and switch pay to play ripoff.  Worst part l... they try to trick users into thinking they can't leave negative reviews.  I'd say give this a low rating on principle, but it's so bad that principle doesn't even come into it.",1
Bad,1
No,1
I thought this was going to be a fun game. But it makes you pay for tons of stuff and without paying its not fun anymore.,1
"Tried to play for hours. Actually connected once out of ten tries, and crashed after ten minutes. This game sucks. And cash for currency is such bullshit.",1
I dunno. Just wasn't engaging. Seemed like it was trying too hard.,2
,1
"The game isn't free. It has a pay to play model which is ridiculously expensive. You can either play a little bit, wait a few days and then play some more or you can give huge piles of cash to the worst company on the planet. Not to mention, if they follow the pattern of past games, this will get pulled down within a year and everyone who paid into the game will be offered a discount on another game. EA likes screwing customers and will keep doing it as long as people keep playing their ""games.""",1
To many micro transactions,1
Pay to not be boring??,1
"I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but I can't seem to stop the audio alerts.  Force-stopping the application doesn't even help.  That, combined with effectively stopping the game if you don't pay up (very quickly things start taking 24 hours to complete without spending a few bucks worth of gems to rush) led me to simply uninstall.  It's a shame.  I loved Dungeon Keeper one and two.",1
"This is free to play by title alone.  If you don't pay, you won't be playing.",1
"Everything about this game is designed to take money from you, and they try to re-direct you to keep from giving less than perfect reviews of the app. EA sucks so very, very hard that I actively look for ways to cost them money.",1
"The app asks you to rate this program. Unless you give it a perfect score, you will be redirected to EA's site. Google should block them for violating the play store rating system.",1
Not worth the time to download,1
,1
"I didn't play this game. What I did do was read several articles about the deceptive way in which EA diverts users from giving their app a less than perfect score by rerouting them. Want to give this game 5 stars? No problem. Anything less and the app takes you from the in-game rating page to an email form asking for feedback. The less than perfect score is never recorded. EA, I'm glad you're asking for feedback from the community, but why not count the score and THEN ask for feedback? DON'T DOWNLOAD!",1
I didn't enjoy this game at all.  And all the stuff trying to get me to pay was not cool.,1
Played the game for a couple weeks. I loved the old pc games. I was really enjoying this one. For some reason the game reset and stayed over. I've not been able to get my dungeon back.,1
EA will try to make users only 5 starts. Look it up and reconsider the integrity of this conglomerate,1
Scammy approach from a greedy publisher.  Ruins the quality of the original game and will only publish ratings from those that give five star reviews after offering in-game incentives to review.  Horrible gaming practices.,1
Dungeon keeper themed Farmville. Nothing but a sad pathetic money grab.,1
"Not only is this a sit and wait unless you pay, they do shady review tactics where when the game asks you to leave a review, you mark stars in game first and if you do anything less than 5 it takes you to a feedback form instead of the Google Play store to actually leave a review.",1
IT IS FUN,5
"Unplayable without spending a fortune in in app purchases. Thanks for ruining another franchise, ea.",1
"Heard this game only allowed 5 star ratings, guess not.",1
Insanely silly length of time to get anything done matched with insane prices of gems makes this an insult to the original game.,1
Waste of time,1
"Not only is it pay to play, this app only will take you to the rating page from in app if you say you'll give it five stars. Scummy behavior at its worst.",1
"AwfulAwful,",1
Far too many microtransactions,1
From the onset of the game I am pushed to use gems. Gems are acquired by spending real money. The gameplay itself is so disrupted by this that I just gave up. The whole game feels like an ongoing advertisement for gems. I am really shocked that this game has so many good reviews. Even if I wanted to blow a few hundred dollars on IAPs--the constant pressure to do so is really distracting. Now EA is gaming the feedback system for Android to generate 5 star reviews.,1
"EA games once again earning the title of everyone's most disliked company. You are a joke, and we will all stop buying your games. Keep it up, see what happens.",1
"If you enjoy waiting for days to be able to do stuff, or paying extra to speed it up, then download this. Games like this are ruining mobile gaming.",1
"Its not actually free if you want to play it, and I don't support these dlc style games",1
Can not get anything done with real money. I get attacked before I can save up for upgrades. Way to play on nostalgia and screw up a game.,1
"Ive had to restart the game four times now because it wont load my previous time and effort. Uninstalling, was fun for a little bit, but EA did it again.",1
This is a shoddy ripoff of the old school Snes game and everything about it is shady from the microtransactions to the in game rating trying to force you to give it a 5 star review.,1
"Same old crap from EA. And, of course, littered with in-app purchases. No thanks, I'll pass.",1
"Rather than  making a game they made a transaction simulation where you give money in one hand and you receive a slap, thanks EA for reminding why everyone will always be better than you",1
"I'll add my comments to everyone else's.  This game would be great as an ad-supported demo with the option to buy it for a one-time $5-10 charge.  However, in its current form it is essentially unplayable unless you are willing to shell out lots of real money to buy in-game gems.  Otherwise, it's no better than any of a thousand other ""clicker"" games out there.  As you progress (very slowly) through the game it makes you wait for longer and longer timers to complete anything in the hopes that you'll finally give in and buy the in-game gems.  Well I won't do it, and I encourage everyone else to refuse to buy the gems.  If nobody buys them, perhaps EA will finally get the hint and make this into a REAL game.",1
"This game is nothing more than a way to scam you out of your money. In fact, I wouldn't trust *anything* from this developer. Horrible!",1
,1
"I was a fan of the original, and now I'm disappointed by EA monopolizing all of their games. This company has gone from a successful franchise pushing out wonderful games, to a terrible business who only wants money and achieves that by exploiting every possible loop hole to get good reviews. You're a disgrace for a developer.",1
Scumbag EA micro transactions are absurd.,1
"Video gaming, it seems, has become a job‚Äîyou play games and feed the hungry stomachs of mega-developers bucketloads of money.    Do yourself a favor, save your money, go buy something that you'll enjoy two weeks from now. And don't spend a penny on this garbage.  Videogaming should be tailored towards the consumer, not the developer. What do we want? Games that are fun and don't put up a fa√ßade of being ""free"", yet require you to spend copious amounts of money on what realistically is a silly game.",1
The high average score for this game is only due to the fact that EA will not let you rate the game anything under 5 stars from within the app.  The game is unplayable without paying way more through in-app purchases than what the fully unlocked game would be worth.,1
"This game takes the venerable ""Dungeon Keeper"" name and takes a dump all over it.  Don't waste your time unless paying to advance is something you like to do.",1
"Loved the original game and got really excited to see the mobile version.  The tutorial was fine, but once I found out you had to buy a constant amount of gems to actually play the game I uninstalled it.  I don't mind ads and I don't mind buying games, but to ask for money every time you do the most basic things in a game is ridiculous.",1
How is this garbage even allowed on the play store? EA you've ruined an epic game from my child hoo,1
EA will only let you rate the game five stars. So here is your one star for that shaddy business practice.,1
I would rather pay 2$ to 5$ for this game if I could play in bouts of 30min in one sitting than pay for this kind of free-to-play...,1
"The epitome of ""Free-to-wait"" gameplay. If you want the game to feel anything like the original, get ready to give EA a lot of your money on a constant basis. The current rating of this game is largely biased towards 5 stars because when EA asks for a rating in game, they only send you to the ratings page if you promise to give it 5 stars. Shame on you EA",1
,1
Deep,1
"At some point one has to wonder who's behind it all at Electronic Arts.  A part of me thinks it may be horney himself.  If you are looking for the dungeon keeper you loved from the late 90s look no further, it'll be out on steam early to mid 2014 under the name War for the Overworld.  This app has nothing for you but textures and sounds reminiscent from the prior games only with no real game play, hours of waiting, and a devilish EA shaped claw looking for your wallet.  Don't feed the trolls!!!  TL:DR bad!",1
Played the game for a bit. Realized you can't advance further if you don't pay for in game currency. Horrible way to do this when the previous version was great.,1
This game sucks.,1
In order to play you have pay. Want to watch your wallet drain? Play this gold digging simulator.,1
I wanted to like this game because I played it a ton back before Ea acquired bullfrog but it's nothing but a game that you have to wait to do anything or pay to go through it faster. Ea should have released a full version of the game without wait times and allowed players to just enjoy the game than pay to get into it. Change your game monetary system and give games players will want to actually play Ea.,1
"Addictive, would like to see, more",4
Crap.,1
Really bad,1
Pay to play pay to win super micro purchasing.,1
okay there are the goods and the bads of this game mostly bad like how cartoony they made it or how you need to pay to play BUT WHEN YOU TELL ME ITS GOING TO TAKE 24 HOURS TO MINE ONE BLOCK YOUD BETTER HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RETARDED,1
,1
,1
,1
,1
Either you pay or wait forever.    Also was going to give it at least a 3star until the ingame pop-up tricks you into giving only 5 star rating on play store and anything less takes you away from play store.,1
Not fun and manipulative.,1
Just terrible,1
"Don't play this game, it sucks",1
"Fun at first, but you quickly hit the pay wall. Everything you need to do takes a day or longer to complete unless you spend real money to speed it up. It's too bad because the game isn't that bad.",1
Tried it out to see what all the fuss was about. Promptly uninstalled after I saw all the shenanigans EA was trying to pull. Do as others have said and get the games on GOG.,1
Love the new tower defense game concept! The timed construction just makes the game more enjoyable longer. If it were to not be timed then I guess it would get boring quick. But then again there are better tower defense games like kingdom rush out there to spend my time on.,5
EA's greed has tarnished another classic. There is no way to progress through this game at a reasonable speed without paying for a number of upgrades. Free to play? More like free to wait.,1
,1
In game purchases are the downfall of mobile gaming. Would not play again.,1
The title says it all. It's only rated so highly because EA is gaming the ratings system.,1
"Don't let their review control tactics work.  Review the game from the Play store, NOT FROM WITHIN THE GAME.  This is the exact same game as Battle Dragons and Clash of Clans.  It is also ruined by microtransactions.  You can only play in very short bursts and progress is VERY slow unless you pay an arm and a leg.  This would probably be a lot better than Battle Dragons and Clash of Clans if it weren't for the paywall.",1
,1
Terrible,1
Its a pay-to-wait game that's completely removed from the real game.  It *could* have been a lot of fun without the arbitrarily long digging times,1
,1
OK I'm sick and tired of buying gems so i can get resources for you royal jerks to take them all trying to cancel something That's bugged and my imp won't work on even though it says my imps are busy,1
Can play without sinking absurd amounts of cash into this game (100s of dollars). Has a very shady inapp rating system that only passes 5 star reviews to the actual store and blocks the others.   I wish Google could pull every EA app from the market for this..,1
Freemium sucks.,1
Unplayable. Very broken game mechanics that'll only be resolved by throwing money at it.  No thanks.,1
They are so freaking expensive.,1
Only because I can't give zero.  This game is fun but full of IAP.  Mostly unplayable.,1
Too bad. Also EA will sell your email address and make you pay to play this game. Calling it free is a disgrace.,1
"I've loved the reincarnation of one of my favorite childhood games but right now it won't let me buy gems, the little window won't pop up. Fix it and you get a 5 star! And now it won't let me use one of my minions but he isn't doing anything.",2
Pay for play,1
Micro transaction crap.,1
"Even with the microtransactions from hell, I was still enjoying the game, but lately my imps seem frozen in the heart and won't do tasks assigned to them. Sometimes I have to cancel an assignment, which causes me to lose resources and then start it back up again to get them to work. Now 5 of the six are just standing around in the heart. Very annoying. EA seems to not care either about fixing problems, just adjusting things in the game to make it more frustrating to play.",2
Sooooooooooo fun on my tablet mine worked just fine :-D :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) looks kreepy w/ a k but NOT AT ALL don't pay for anything,5
Not only did they ruin a great game with their greed...they only allow 5 star ratings via in game. Way to lower yourselves EA. Just stop making games. Here's a one star. Installed this garbage ONLY to give this one star since you FORCE 5 star reviews. Jerks.,1
"I have removed this game from my devices until EA learns that people want to play the games they have, instead of paying for every little feature.  Get real with the micro (and I use this term loosely; one of the gem bundles is the same price as a AAA console game) transactions, and be more clear about how the star ratings work.",1
Don't waste time here.,1
You know how in minecraft it takes you a few seconds to dig up a cube? Could you imagine trying to do the same thing but it would take 24 hours unless you paid to have it removed? That's dungeon keeper. So obvious in it's greedy-ness that it also has to manipulate it's own rating system to stay a float. Do not support this.,1
"I love the original game. This is not that game. This is just forcing you on Raul's to follow a set path and spend money.  If I could rate it 0 stars, I would",1
"I hate the way EA is doing business and i hope my ""vote"" helps them come to their senses.",1
"You can do very little in this ""game""  before you hit a paywall. Not how it's meant to be, EA.",1
I keep getting code 7 I would love to play but can't plz fix I have android,1
Money hungry game... if you dont sink money in its very slow and boring,1
,1
Typical EA,1
You want to play? You better pay!  Plus the deceptive stuff trying to keep people from rating it anything other than 5 stars?  Nice try EA!,1
The game is broken because of all the in game purchases.,1
EA has destroyed this game by making it pay to play garbage (big surprise). The original game for PC is fun and exciting. This is just an embarrassment to the name. Every action takes such a ridiculously long time people are conned into spending money just to accomplish the basic goals of the game.,1
This game is terrible. Literally every aspect of it is behind a pay wall. Do not let the industry nickel and dime you like this. The original dungeon keeper and keeper 2 is on gog for about $5 each in their entirety. Stop giving these types of games money.,1
This is the worst game ever!,1
"Apart from that, it's a pale shadow of the old dungeon keeper games that inspired it.  Infuriatingly long times required to dig out new areas of dungeon.  Green gems which are required to advance are exceptionally rare, unless you buy them with real money.  So much for a ""free"" app",1
"Just a money grab, as usual. Typical EA. Really hope Nintendo buys them out.",1
And yet another Free to Play screw up. Without paying heaps of money you can't even play it.,1
The game is a farce as are the ratings.  You must pay a lot of money to make the game worthwhile and they are manipulating the Play Store ratings.,1
It's companies like this that ruin the video game art form. They just want money. They don't care about anything else,1
"Pay to play is not Ok, plus this game lacks DK atmosphere with its cartoonish design.",1
Pay to play. Also they have gamed the ratings system to artificially enhance the game's score.,1
Forces only 5 star ratings from within the game,1
"It was like visiting your favorite uncle's house, having lots of fun with right up until dinner, when he tells you that if you don't want to eat the free porridge, you can pay him $10 for a plate of lasagna.   ...and he will play a game of cards with you for only $5 as a limited-time offer.  ...and you can sleep in a bed tonight for just.$10, instead of on the basement floor.  In short, while I understand why they went for the money, I really would have rather played the original again.",1
,1
Between the paywalls and the bs attempt to stop low ratings I find ea is living up to its reputation as the worst game developer out there. I will never purchase an EA game for any platform again as long as I live,1
,1
Omg run!,1
This game exists solely to steal your money.  Its gameplay is designed 100% around microtransactions.  It's a racket and a sham and Electronic Arts should be shut down.  They bring shame to all developers and gamers alike.,1
"Pay to play? No thanks, EA. If you want to earn money from your game, charge a modest price for it. Is there no gaming platform that you can't royally screw up?",1
Screw these leeches.,1
,1
This isn't even a game. Its a stopwatch you can pay to speed up.,1
Pay to play and wont publish any in app rating below 5 stars. EA should be permanently booted from the android market,1
Only gives you the option to rate 5 stars within the game.  Also pay to win,1
"If you follow the in game prompt to rate this game and you select anything but 5 star it takes you to the ea website but if you rate it five stars it takes you to Google play. This falsely shows a high rating. Don't get this money grabbing, lying game.",1
"As stated by others, there is no real progression without buying gems.",1
"What makes this even worse, is that trying to rate this app anything other than 5 stars inside of the program redirects to a feedback page; in effect only allowing 5 star reviews to circle through from the app.",1
I have played the original Dungeon Keeper and thought this would be close enough to the original to enjoy. Not even close. This game is hardly usable. EA is making a huge grab for money here. I would not recommend playing this unless you are willing to throw a lot of money into the whole pay to play thing. I had to say I was going to give them a 5-star rating for them to let me review this. They would make me email them if i gave it less. I hope google does something about this complete abuse of their system.,1
Thanks EA for ruining a franchise. Also for preventing you from submitting a review unless it's 5 stars from within the application....,1
Fun game while I could play despite the long wait time and super expensive gems. That is while I could play. I was enjoying the game until I bought gems to get a third imp. As soon as I did all my imps stopped doing their jobs. Which was annoying enough when I emailed ea for help the sent me a link to their useless help website multiple times even after I told them I couldnt find the help I was looking for. Uninstalling all my ea games and will think twice before purchasing anything from ea. Ive had better help from small developers. Im left feeling like I just got robbed. Shame on ea games!!!,1
The game is engineered to effectively require the user to spend money to continue playing beyond a certain point due to resource requirements.  This does not meet my definition of 'free to play'.Furthermore EA has hijacked the rating option to deflect low ratings unless you come directly to the Play store.,1
Don't waste your time,1
Nothing but a scam. They attempt to force good votes and charge tons for things that should be free. EA is demonstrating the worst side of gaming.,1
"I loved this game when I played it  on the PC, so I was thrilled to see it ported to the Android. As I started to play I was impressed with the quality of graphics and how the game play progressed. Soon I found that the real currency of the dungeon is gems and they don't come cheap. You start out with 500 gems, but they get used up rather quickly. Want to add an imp ? 800 gems please -- which translates into $8.00. Sure you can dig for them ... .you will get two or three for four hours, you might get five for an entire day of digging. You do the math.   Don't get me wrong, developers deserve to be paid for their work, and the truth is I would have rather paid outright for this game than to be held hostage to IAP.   In short, if you want to play .. be prepared to pay ... a lot. I am uninstalling this horror show.",1
"In typical EA fashion, more money gouging bullshit.   People, STOP GIVING EA A REASON TO DO THIS! You can't ALL be too retarded to understand that concept!",1
This is an absolutely horrible rendition of a classic. Typical EA shenanigans.,1
,1
They put too many micro transactions in this game. It is hardly playable unless you spend serious cash. Just download the original game somewhere else.,1
The game will randomly steal gems...really puts a halt on the game when a person is trying not to spend money.,2
Sub par. I don't like waiting a day to do anything. I also don't like how this app tries to get you to rate it 5 stars.,3
Rather pay for game than deal with this ...kills game play.,2
"I slogged through 2 weeks of playing this thinking the designers might reward success with bounty that moves the game forward. NOPE! For people complaining about 24 real hours to dig out 1 block or build,  wait until you get to 48 real hours or 371 gems (worth $4 U.S. dollars) to build out a temple.  Uninstalling! Worst Freemium model ever!",1
Not worth wasting you time.,1
"Glad to see an old game finally get polished up again. However, the 10 gems i was suppose to receive for linking my account mysteriously disappeared im not one to spend money if i dont have to so every gem counts.",5
,1
"Just another money hungry, micro transaction games that you can't really play without without paying. Don't be fooled by any of the good ratings.",1
"This app manipulates players into artificially giving it a 5 star rating by only allowing players that agree to give it a 5 star rating to pass through the rating request check. Anyone who wants to give fewer stars are redirected to email EA instead.  While the agreement to give 5 stars is not binding, it artificially ""filters"" lower ratings.",1
Money sink,1
"I loved the original DK games. I was really excited when I saw they had released an android version. Massive fail! You can't accomplish anything without constantly forking over cash. Plus, it's glitchy. I read an article on my BBC app about how angry people were over the release of this game, and EA's response was that they felt they had got the balance right. Well EA, you would be wrong.",1
They took a great game and made it cost tons of money to really play. It would be way better if the game cost a couple dollars and was more faithful to the old school dungeon keeper.,1
"Costs too much of ""in app purchased"" items in order to make it playable",1
"This game is at best a mediocre non-noteworthy game that you shouldn't waste your time on.  It also manipulates reviews by redirecting people who try to give it less than 5 stars from within the app to a separate website.  Sadly, most of the people bothered by this game are stupid enough not to notice.",1
"I was excited to see Dungeon Keeper hit the smartphone scene, but less so to see the EA logo slapped on to it. Though it's great to see some familiar faces and play the role of dungeon keeper again, there are some serious short comings. The first being the pay to win strategy inherent in nearly every smartphone game. I understand ""they have to make their money"" but the pricing is ridiculous. Secondly raids and pvp are on par with what you'd find with any SNES or older tactics game. Total time sink.",1
Interesting game but waaaaaay too many glitches and waaaaaay overpriced add-ons. Not worth the effort.,2
"This is one of the worst pay-to-win games out there.  The difficulty ramps up immediately and everything grinds to a halt almost upon starting the game. Also, after seeing the game's deceptive ""rate our game"" practices, I couldn't give this anything but a 1-star.  Seriously, unless you say you will give the game a 5-star review, it won't take you to the Google Play Store to review it.",1
Boring,1
"I had to rate it at least 2 because the graphics are great, and it IS free AND playable, if you like building minions to fight battles. But mining and creating loads of imps, sadly, isn't practical in this version, when going the free route. And it's good for people who want to play an app once a day, I haven't played in three days! A single purchase that allows you to mine like crazy, join/create guilds with friends, AND fill blocks in would be great. But you couldn't keep trying to rob people blind through their addictive eagerness and impatience.",2
Very poor effort from EA.  I can't remember the last time a game crashed so often.  Skip it.,1
In Omnia Paratus.  New guild,4
,1
EA turned an old classic game into a micro transaction mess.  Game was unplayable for me.  Want to dig or build rooms without waiting for an artificial timer to count down?  Spend money!,1
"Should have read more reviews before installing, it's a pay-to-play game.  Only install if you don't mind that.",1
"It's the complete draining of the soul of what was a classic from many of our youths. Micro transactions, artificially inflated wait times. Inability to rate the game anything but a 5 from within the app? No refunds if you decide this game isn't raking in enough cash for you and decide to shut it down in a month? No thanks. You won't see a dime from me.",1
"Micro-transactions are suppose to be benefit, not a wall of hindered play.",1
Would rather pay up to 10 bucks for a normal game that doesn't require me spending hundreds to be able to keep pace.,1
,1
simply just that.,1
It could be fun but unless you want to spends gobs of real money it's nearly impossible to get gems and advance.   Uninstalled,1
don't buy it,1
"I had a feeling EA would ruin a amazing old title by making you pay too really get anywhere. I would rather play the real game, this sucks..",1
Free crystal to few and in between.,4
"This is not dungeon keeper, stay far away. Don't support this ridiculous micro-transaction-fest",1
"The amount of money you need to put into this ""game"" is atrocious. Don't waste your time on it. It violates the spirit of the original games in order to make some quick money off of you.",1
"This game is horrible. The design isn't really fun, and if you want to do anything money is required. Free to play.... actually mean you click twice and wait 8 hours to click again. It made we load DK2 on my computer. Which is fun. This doesn't even compair to the originals.",1
"This mobile reboot of the DK series has none of the charm of the original two games and the in-game purchases are an unwelcome, game-breaking addition.",1
"Great game , besides the micro transactions and relying on servers.",4
Hot steaming garbage.,1
"If you are looking for a port of the original, dont bother. There really is no way to stop people from raiding your dungeon.  So much so, you might as well not even bother trying.  Just leave everything open and factor in losing half your resources every few hours.  If you cant build and plan a dungeon, whats the point of playing dungeon keeper?",2
"It constantly interrupts your game to get you to sign in with your Google account so you can be tracked. If you don't, it will take you out of the game without warning and ask you again to sign in. If this is done during a raid, you will lose all minions used during that raid.",3
"It's all over the internet, just look up how bad this is. A complete waste, and a darn shame too.",1
"This is not even a game same things i see on fb, the simpson taped out, ill stick to animal crossing on my ds tyvm at least i dont have to waste real money to move forward and i can do more than just build and upgrade in it.",1
,1
"Basically, it's a pay to win type of game... if you don't pay, then be ready to wait hours and even days to build your rooms, upgrades or even destroy blocks of dirt (specially those take the longest)",1
,5
It took 30 minutes to get through the tutorial and it's a poor version of Clash of Clans.,1
Wait time is too long every thing cost to much money real and in game money its ea being ea just pass on this,1
EA is just milking this with  excessive timers wanting you to pay (will rate better when the game is fun or it feels like a game where they don't just want your money) Also: in game it asks you to rate it.. If you do below 4 stars it goes to their db and doesn't rate it on Google so they can keep their rating high..shady) Uninstalling for months.,1
"I would have no problem paying something for the download and then having free reign, but this micro transaction model is horrible. I can download dungeon keeper 2 for $6 and play it through. Why would anyone ever pay $100 for enough gems to barely get three or four 1 day dig blocks cleared?! It's a rip off.",3
"Need Gems to play cant play without Gems game is a pocket digger, minions cost too much, works too slow, impossible to get Gems unless your payin, takes sevrral days for certain things to be done and cant do nothing if your minions are busy smh game has many down fall could've been a good game but not worth the time had to delete it",1
"Like most, remember the old versions and loved them. Downloaded the game and within about an hour the freemium aspect shows up and you start getting longer times between moves. That is fine for the type of game it is as they are all act and wait games. The problem starts showing up later in the game when your protection runs out and you get constantly raided to the point you cannot earn resources. I will consider higher if they increase protection time between attacks so you can actually grow.",3
Only for those willing to spend A LOT of money to progress.,1
"Bought a third imp, been using all three for the past week, 2 imps finish while 1 is still working, I try to build or mine something but it says all my imps are busy.  Very unfortunate.",3
Anyone notice  how the dude looks like the Crimson chin,5
U GUYS HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG IV LOOKED FOR THIS GAME!!!,5
,1
"This ""game"" is sadly no more than a money grab. If you do not pay for gems then playing is almost impossible.  Don't fall for it leave this app alone.",1
"Another pay to play tap and wait game that tries to stop you from rating it. Time to reinstall the original on my PC, I suppose. :(",1
It won't let me name the dungeon.... fix it please,2
The game is fun but the enemy casters keep glitching into the wall where they can attack you but you can't attack them.,2
also i want to restart and there seems to be no way too,1
"I wish this game was just a paid app without IAP, they are too pricey for what you get. The gameplay is slow and it takes forever for anything to finish.",3
"An abomination of cash-grabbing, player-abusing, exploitation of the gold-rush of the Farmville-like ""free2wait"" mechanic. If you're stupid enough to pay these people so as not to be forced to wait for a task to complete then you are contributing to a cancer in the gaming industry. This is exactly why people don't trust f2p.",1
Ruined the game,1
Props EA,5
,1
"Nostalgia got me and even though I knew it wouldn't be the same, I was still disappointed. With most free to play, you can still do something productive every 5 or 10 minutes. But in this game you're stagnant. You can't do anything productive for free that doesn't take at least a day. It's just not worth the time.",2
,1
"I loved the original DK and lived to play DK2... I can see why so many people are upset. The graphics are great, yes. But otherwise, the constant waiting for VERY little to happen is excruciating. So bad, in fact, that I got online and paid $6 for the original on my PC. The graphics might not be great, but the game play is better than this monstrosity. A shame too... this had so much potential. Instead, it is a wonderfully illustrated,  rage inducing, money pit. Bullfrog would be horrified.",2
"1 - This is nothing like dungeon keeper of old.  It feels almost exactly like clash of clans... but much slower somehow. 2 - I don't mind  micro transaction pay models, but this game is unplayable without dropping serious cash.  I refuse to shell out a bunch of dough to even see the gameplay.  EA is bad and should feel bad.  The only glimmer of hope in this 'game' is that it may be a sign of a cancer eating this monolithic development house from within...  When it finally crumbles maybe something decent will take it's place.",1
"Poor excuse for a Dungeon Keeper game . This is nothing but Farmville skinned up to look like Dungeon Keeper. This ""game"" puts up a pay wall at every turn. Want to build that trap? Pay up or wait 4 hours, Dig out that square? Break out that credit card or wait a day.    Whats worse is the prompt to rate the game if you try to rate it anything below 5 stars you are redirected to email them about why but if you rate it 5 stars it goes straight to the play store. Only by manually going into the play store was I able to type this. EA's attempt at keeping bad reviews at bay.",1
"EA has decided to move their business model into pure greed, manipulation, and deception.  This is yet another example of their moronic executive decision making ruining what could have been a legit success...but no.  My advice...don't bother with this shallow money grab.  My advice to EA...fire the idiot MBAs and hire management that cares about good products and customers.  Uninstalled.",1
,3
Unless you buy gems the resource collection and build times are ridiculously long. This is a game trying to force you to spend money for it to be fun instead of a fun game that you can spend money on to get small advantages or cosmetics. It constantly asks you to log in with Google plus or your email even if you repeatedly say no. It constantly glitches and crashes. It has to reboot even if your screen just locks for a second. Would not recommend to anyone.,1
,5
"Instead of updating through the play store, this game uses its own update system. Unfortunately this system doesn't have an option to run only when on wifi, so it uses my data plan when I'm not expecting it.",3
Poor form EA for trying to game the Google play ratings...,1
"Buys cost too much, slow to load, disconnects if you walk away for a few minutes, build times take forever.  I like the game, because I loved the original DK games.  I wish they had a free build mode.",3
"I've been playing this game for a while and I love it. However, today I finally was able to buy a third imp. Two of them aren't doing anything but when I try to make them clear a wall it says they are busy? Needs to be fixed!",4
The rate at which you get resources is very slow and why would you make it take a whole day to dig out a single gem vein!! No room for creativity in layouts and  nowhere near as good as clash of clans,1
The first hour is fun and after that's it's really disappointing,2
Thanks and uninstalling.,1
i'll never understand the idea that i'm supposed to pay for something that i just burn trying to play a game. charge me for better skins or some sort of permanent upgrade. paying so something doesn't take 4 hours is just an aweful game to play.,1
The game is fun. However when I open the app about half of the time the tutorial will start to run. This can be solved by closing and reopening the app but it should not happen.,2
For the most part I have no issues with micro transactions and have played many games with them. That is not the case here. EA took a wonderful IP and created what could have been a great update to the series and then made the game unplayable unless you pay what can get excessive for a mobile game. The fact that you can only complete one or two actions per day makes pointless to play. I would happily pay a single fee to buy the game and even pay for DLC but the micro transactions take the fun out of it,1
"Crippled game requiring either an enormous attention span our an even larger wallet. Don't bother, even on a dare.",1
In-app purchases are pretty much a must to get anywhere in this game. Game-breaking bugs madey game unplayable about two weeks into it. Avoid at all costs.,1
"Absolute disgrace on EA's part, to take a great IP and turn it into a pay to wait.  Thanks for ruining two of my favorite games of all time.",1
,1
,1
Game takes forever to load. It takes days to do anything. Has hardly anything that was fun from the original DK1 and 2. The store is outrageously over priced. EA you ruin almost everything you touch and you're more greedy then the IRS.... let me ask you EA. What is supposed to be fun about this game?,1
"Not a game, just a waiting app.",1
Too many microtransactions. Not the game we used to play.,1
,1
"My dungeon will sometimes load, other times it will bring me to a brand new dungeon. I have to re load the game to get my saved dungeon but there's like a 45 second load every time, which turns me away a bit.  My imps also always say they're busy when I have no jobs going. I don't know how to fix but its extremely hard to do anything with these setbacks.  Concept is great though",3
Good,5
Was alright to play. But the game didn't save my progress and the next time I went into it I had to start from the beginning again. I think I'm just gonna install the original game on my pc and play it there. Much better on a big screen.,2
They took micro purchases to the next level by charging an absorbent amount of money in order just to play the game correctly. EA should be ashamed of themselves.,1
"Take almost every fun thing about Dungeon Keeper out of the game, then stretch it over Clash of Clans, then make it slower and more expensive, then you have this app. Get to work on Dungeon Kepper 3 and make the fans happy.",1
I purchased an gems yesterday in order to but another imp. Set him working on a 24 hours dig. Had only 2 hours left and all of a sudden he was free and the space wasn't clear. Timer keeps gliding on other imps working as well. Frustrated,1
"Forces to connect to Google plus. If I say I don't want it once, asking me to connect every time I play is going to get a bad review. Sell your wares through some one else.",2
I wish i could UN play this,1
"This is a pure money extraction app. That is, EA wants to extract money from you. Everything in this game takes forever, and you can speed it up with gems, but you get gems in-game so slowly that it's maddening. You can, however, pay money to get gems.  I refuse. I would be happy to pay to play a good game, but this is far from a good game. It's akin to having to pay a dollar for every step your character takes.  Finally, there's not even a fun endgame that I can determine. You build your dungeon, but to what end? So you can defend it against other players? That's not fun because all you get is a message saying that you either did or didn't defend your dungeon. Or you can raid other players, but that's just not fun.  Run away. Run from this ""game.""",1
"To enjoy this 'free' game you have to buy gems, otherwise the game doesn't move quickly. Not at all like the DK I remember on Windows, totally disappointing.",1
I have only been playing for a few days and I have ran into quite a few glitches(galaxy note 3). Most  of them have been while building it spends my money and does not use an imp so it is just wasting what i am working to get..... Other times i open the app and it is just a black screen.  But i have enjoyed the concept of the game,3
"Glitchy, continually needs to reconnect to servers oh and did I mention the pay walls?  Waiting days for imps to dig a corridor isn't my idea of fun",1
I love the original Dungeon Keeper games but this one is all about money!! I recommend Castle Clash!!,2
"Can't play, acts like i have two accounts, then won't let me use imps to mine or build because it wants me to name my other account while I'm in my active one but won't let me name it. Like the game but even after three reinstalls it still won't work. Stuck in the same spot. - tried creating new google account that didn't work either. Not sure what to do at this point.",3
"Getting anything done is a long and boring process. I've been waiting got dungeon keeper, but this is NOT like the computer games at all. EA has given us a game that embodies all of the worst things about the free to play model.",1
"I really enjoy this game - if it were run by anyone other than EA, I'd actually spend money on it. 1 Star for EA ruining things they touch. RIP Bullfrog.",1
"I'm so tired of this horrible formula.  Wait forever to accomplish something or pay a retarded amount of real cash to speed up your journey through lame, repetitive content.",1
This is a clear bastardization of a beloved IP  I'll be doing what I can to keep EA from getting any money for any product they release,1
I always love dungeon keeper but they ruin it if you want to enjoy this game you have to pay money,1
I love this game.... except when it Has to reconncet. And it sees you back. -_-,3
"Please play the original dungeon keeper on pc instead. The just make dungeon keeper version of farmville. If you like farmvile u might enjoy this game, but if you are looking for good old dungeon keeper. Look somewhere else.",1
"However it lacks something to keep me wanting to play, I enjoy that I can gather gems without cash purchase and the game is a brilliant tower defense concept crossed with a real time city builder,  its a great attempt I expected nothing less from a game boasting EA's logo. However I wouldn't find myself eager to pay the game it became another chore on my to do list of games. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take up almost my entire phone memory, I'd rather have more than 1 game.",4
"Remember Dungeon Keeper? I hope you do because EA sure doesn't.  Nearly every action in the game requires a microtransaction, and the ones that don't require it encourage it by making you wait up to a day. To dig out one square of your dungeon. An entire day. This MIGHT be forgivable if there were some gameplay to back it up, but there really isn't. This is nothing but a bastardised version of a classic, and is not worth your time, and especially not your money.  EA ought to be ashamed.",1
"The waiting is interminable. the gem market is rediculous, and the fact that it takes days to carve out the exterior spaces make this game nearly unplayable.   If I wait to build up resources, I get raided.   If I raid, I end up spending half my resources on rebuilding my non-persistant army, which doesn't defend me from raids.   Despite my sound and notifications being muted, the game still plays notification sounds.",1
I was there when the original Dungeon Keeper came out and it was an awesome game. The fact that it has been reduced to a ptp disaster is nothing short of disgusting. Any attempt to enjoy the advances and new features given to this game are wrecked by the constant ptp pop ups and reconnect interrupts. Gladly would have paid 20 dollars for a fully functional game free of this bile. Congratulations EA you ruined another potential franchise by trying to kill the goose before it even laid an egg.,1
,1
"The app is very slow and won't stay connected to servers.  It keeps dropping the connection, without crediting resources back that were lost due to connection drop.  Lots of bugs and very slow to make progress in game.  Cost of upgrades is high, and severely limited by the dungeon heart.  Don't waste your time.",1
Boring. No fun. Squeezes you for every penny. Disrespects the original dungeon keeper games,1
"Give me back the old dungeon keeper, just with better graphics",1
Sucks,1
"Being a huge fan of the original DK series I was excited to see it finally brought to the mobile platform, only to have my excitement crushed as I found out what could have been made a great gaming app was instead a greedy cash grab by EA to nickel and dime the players if they wanted any kind of enjoyment out of the game. I would have happily paid for this app up front and given it 5 stars if it played like DK, but instead it's just the DK name in a Trojan horse to greedily make money. Very disappointed.",1
Having the originals on PC makes this game terribly disappointing. I paid 6 dollars for the full version of this game. There is no way I'm spending over a dollar to dig a single block.,1
"While interesting in concept, the game quickly becomes an annoying exercise of logging on to accelerate your imps work and collect your resources. It actually takes longer to load than you spend in the game. Resource bottlenecks sre significant and the game balance is poorly planned. It is obvious little to no analysis was done on the time it takes to obtain resources and the benefit. Heavily skewed to get you to spend money judt to play rather than to spend money to enhancd the experience. Disappointing in general.",2
Game has lots of bugs and you will need to buy gems if you want to make it any where in the game,1
It's alright but not near the spirit of the old game. It is more like Clash of Clans but not nearly as polished and more of a cash grab than anything.,2
,4
Microtrans and boring.,1
"Good game, pay to excel but good free content.  Two big problems keep me from giving 5 stars:  First, you can never start a new game - you are stuck with you first try.  This is bad because once you build or claim something you can never get rid of it.  Mistakes made from first day noobishness will haunt you eternally.  Second, the game currently only allows one account per device so if you share your device only one person can play the game (at least on Android) without reinstalling between player changes.",3
"Doing simple things requires an obscene amount of time, or the real money currency in the games. All game play from the original dungeon keeper is gone, and is replaced with a shell of what should have never been",1
This game used to be really fun on PC. But EA has removed anything fun from it in order to push microtransactions way beyond what is reasonable. If they want more people to play it they need to stop affecting the central gameplay in order to nickel and dime everyone.,1
"EA, a company which used to be about creating amazing things, has taken a beloved title and piddled terrible buy mechanics all throughout. This game is only a dry husk of its former self and they have artificially inflated the dig times to the point where there is a negative impact on gameplay. This is NOT how you do a free to play.",1
But now it won't let me play. It tries to load then reconects  and wants me to start over. I'm glad i wasn't spending money on it.,1
"All greed, no gameplay",1
This game isn't good at all,1
Poor game in general designed to maximise microtransaction only,1
"This isn't a game, it's a waiting simulator.  The further you get, the more you wait.  Progress becomes essentially impossible unless you want to spend money. And the gem packs are obscenely expensive.  Shame on EA for ruining a solid franchise.",1
Do not download!,1
This is NOT the dungeon keeper you were hoping for or remember.  It's just another money grab by EA.,1
"I was able to save up enough gems in two weeks to buy my third worker, way easier to earn gems than in clash of clans.",5
A game can't be very good when the publisher has to resort to rigging the ratings. Look it up on Slashdot.,1
Completely ruined a great game with your ridiculous prices. In order to get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time it would take tons of money. This isn't anything like the old dungeon keeper. Way to ruin a game with your greed.  Should a just stuck the game with a price tag and it would've been better off,1
This game has so much potential but ea is just nickel and diming the whole way. They are just playing on how many people loved dungeon keeper. Once you realize it takes 24 hours to remove a single block the game losses its appeal.,1
"Unfortunately I spent all my money trying to progress through the game, I couldn't afford the ""5 star rating"" DLC.   (PS I lied. This game sucks and is a pathetic money grubbing attempt by EA)",1
Why should I have to pay $5 to dig out two blocks?,1
,1
"The ""gate"" to rate the App is pretty sneaky. Also, I preferred the push notifications without the loud sound attached.",1
"Crashed the first time I tried to run it, then made me wish it had kept crahing. If you recognize the name Dungeon Keeper at all, avoid this and go play one of the real DK games.",1
"Starts pushing for money from square one. There is no game only micro transactions. If you wonder at the high ratings, the in game prompt only allows for 5 star ratings to get through. Utterly shameful.",1
Unfortunately with this game is way too many microtransactions to fully enjoy this game ea has done a pitiful job in recreating this Android port,1
I saw the rap video dan bull made,5
,2
Cant play any further please fix i have a cool pad quatro,1
Takes Waaay too long to get through dirt and is nothing like the original dungeon keeper. If you liked dungeon keeper you will hate this. They ruined it.,1
Just awful.,1
"I loved the original, but there is very little here that even comes close to it. The free to play model on this game just makes it a hurry to wait some more. You will either do that or spend too much money on something that shouldn't even have the name, Dungeon Keeper.  If this were closer to the original I'd gladly pay for it, but to be tricked into a lack luster skin of the game it used to be... I'll pass.",1
EA's greed knows no bounds. Another classic game smothered by in-game purchases as the only real means to play in real time. Expensive ones at that. Stick to the console oldies and pass this cash cow by.,1
"The game asks every once in a while if you want to leave a rating, and if you don't choose 5 stars it doesn't send you to the review page. These are dishonest tactics to discourage non-perfect ratings.",1
,4
"If you`re a big Clash of Clans type of person, you`re ganna love this game. Just like Clash of Clans, i quit this game in spite of how similar those 2 games are. Its got the whole wait system when you build a certain part of the dungeon. Some take 5 minutes, others take almost a day. Im just not that patient.",2
,1
"Thanks for ruining one of my favorite franchises once again, EA.",1
"Not only is it not like dungeon keeper, it's boring. There's nothing to do but wait and wait and wait. Unless you want to pay. No thanks.",2
"Quality compared to original on PC is horrible. Its on par with EAs several failed games in the last few years. Game basically forces the player to purchase time completion units to complete tasks in a timely fashion, otherwise plan on spending several days waiting for a task to complete. Don't recommend. Uninstalling.",1
I have always known EA games for its shoty development for maxim profits in PC games and for its attitude towards gamers and employees (If you don't like it there's the door). But a phone app as well? Come on EA *sighs*. Gems are what you need the most in this game and gems are what you will pay for. EA is so greedy they don't even let you earn gems with surveys or offers. Cash only people.,1
"The monitization in this thing is awful. Absolutely dreadful. The entire game grinds to a halt with its absurdly long waiting times to do ANYTHING. The worst part is that this could've been good! It had all the makings and elements of a decent game that I would've paid straight up money for. Instead, we get this horribly pay-wall ridden ""game"" that takes a dump on the original Dungeon Keeper.",1
dug up the corpse of a classic and tried to turn it into a cash cow. Evil in all the wrong ways.,1
just write ea a check if you want to give them money.  this isn't even a game.,1
"So you get 500 gems to start.  These are precious because you need imps above all else unless you plan to pay boatloads of cash. The interface though makes it easy to waste them. One wrong tap and you spent 100s. It will then take you 4 hours to mine 3gems to make that up. So one wrong tap and you need 120 hours to erase the mistake.   Also, the tutorial tells you to capture mines. You do this and later realize this was a mistake.  Solution: get another google account and reinstall game... awesome",1
"This is bad, and the development team should feel bad for making it.",1
I remember the old games on pc and they were a blast. This is no fun. Can't make a dungeons like in the old games. Its more like do a little come back in like a day and repeat unless you pay to speed things up. This is a waste of time now worth playing at all.,1
Great to see Horny back in action.  Too bad the execution is crap.  Don't fell like dropping a hundy to really play.,3
"This is a blatantly obvious use of a classic game that EA molded to abuse the ""Free To Play"" gaming model. Try it for yourself and you'll know exactly what I mean. It's games like this that give ""Free To Play""  games a bad reputation. EA tarnished the classic Dungeon Keeper games with this ripoff.",1
I want this came to work so much. But I want to build a dungeon. Not spend a week digging a small hole for my new room to go into. And then spend another week so that my 2 yes only 2 minions can build a strong wall around that one room. This game is either a major time or money suck. can you say $100? I'm getting out before that seems too tempting. Also I would have rated this a 2 but due to the in game rating system skewing the results of peoples ratings. I'm giving it a 1.,1
The chat needs time stamps and alerts that ppl are talking while your on. You're trophy level should determine who you can attack not you're bass level. And any troops that don't die at the end of a attack should go back to you're bass of give you there gold value in return. And work on the guild menu and make a place to report problems that would be nice.,4
This game is paced very slowly I suspect this is to encourage you to speed things up with cash. Also this game is very slow to load on my galaxy s4.,1
"Game is hideously expensive to play, and their incredibly deceptive marketing practices are just disgusting. They basically try to trick people into giving a 5 star review, if you say you won't give them 5 stars they don't let you rate it on Google Play. That's why it has so many 5 star reviews. It's trickery. AVOID!!!",1
This app will drain your time or it will drain your money.  It's not worth either one.  There are a lot of other options that are more fun and less expensive than  this.,1
I liked the original DK and was hoping with the mobile version there would be some semblance of the original game. There is the look and a bit of a feel but way too much waiting. Right from the start I was waiting on everything. I know it is free to pay but the necessity to buy gems or wait 24 hours is just crazy. Ended up giving up .,1
"EA has proven their reputation as the worst company in America with this ""game."" They have put every terrible f2p practice into this, with the demands for in-app purchases starting while you're still in the tutorial. This is a ""pay-to-wait"" game in no uncertain terms and the developers deserve nothing less than a place in the special hell for subjecting the public to this pile of garbage.",1
Dungeon Keeper is just another cow clicker. Tarnishing the name of Dungeon Keeper and likely the worst thing that EA have released to date. And that is saying a lot.,1
Its impossible to save up resources.  Why the hell do you still lose resources even though  your attacker failed to defeat you.  It makes no sense at all. They're trying to make sure you spend money,1
Slippery slope once you start accepting things like dlcs as the norm.  You end up with stuff like this.,1
Great!,5
"Started out really liking this game, until you are stuck paying for everything with gems to get anything done. The constant bugs with builders not building is beyond annoying. EA there is a way to encourage payment by letting us actually build without it, then we want to pay you to speed things up. Go look at greed for glory and their VIP and gem costs. Brilliantly done, learn from them. Will keep installed to see if you folks learn.  Update: uninstalled this game is horrible.",1
Pure unadulterated excrement,1
Almost good for a week.  Then you spend more time waiting and looking at the loading screen than playing...,1
"I liked this game at first but now...not so much. It takes too long to do anything unless you pay for gems, which are ridiculously over priced for what you get. The time it takes to accomplish dungeon remodeling is absurde...unless you want to spend lots of gems to speed up the process...which will cost you real money that could be better spent on other things.",1
"OF CLASH OF CLANS. If you like Hay Day  or  Clash of class,  or township, or jurrasic park, youll like this. A great strategy game similiar to clash a clans (On of the top 3 games on App store and google play.) Love it!",5
"This game perverts the spirit of the Bullfrog games, turning a fun game about exploration and defense into a souped up alarm clock that primarily works in intervals of 4 hours.  One reviewer called this free to wait, not free to play.  Truer words were never spoken (in writing).",1
piece of crap and wont let you rate lower then for and had super expencive microtranactions,1
Try your best.,5
In charge of ruining child hood games.,1
"The play is expensive, tedious,  unoriginal, and dumbed down.  There is none of the original strategy or flair.   This is yet another blundering abuse of a classic title.  Such a waste.",1
Not worth playing if you're not willing to pay,1
"I downloaded this game and then realized it was by EA so I quickly uninstalled it. For games by EA there is only one priority, money. They don't really care if you enjoy yourself.",1
Just wants your money. Takes days for stuff to happen.,1
"I would gladly pay $5 for this game if EA didn't bastardize it with micro transactions. You guys killed DK, I hope you're happy",1
You can't progress unless you pay,1
"This game requires in App purchases to play, if not... Have fun waiting a week to mine blocks",1
"Takes the worst aspects of the Free-To-Pay model and turns them up to eleven, while ripping out anything of value that the Dungeon Keeper franchise might have brought to the table.  I would have paid actual money for a proper Dungeon Keeper Mobile game faithful to the original, but the pathetic and constant plea for money is absolutely revolting and insulting.  On top of all this, it tries to game the system- when the game asks you to rate it, if you indicate you're not going to give it a five-star review, you get sent to a closed submission system that does *not* appear on the Play Store, artificially boosting the game's average rating on the Store.  Another insult.",1
"Free, expect for $800 of in app purchases....",1
"Stability fix needed, tablet lock while attacking, causes raids to end in defeat.  Steep learning curves in the begining.",2
This piece of garbage pops up constantly to rate. Your options are 5 or 1-4. Any attempts to rate less than a 5 send you to the EA site. This is in blatant violation of Google policy. I recommend everyone report this app for its disgustingly obvious attempts to rig the rating system. I also recommend that we mark as spam any obviously bought 5 star reviews.,1
I had previously rayed this 5 stats because it was entertaining. Now everyday I go to play it has to down load updates first. Not only is it incredibly frustrating waiting the 10 minutes for it to update before I can simply collect my gold but it had also eaten up half a gig in only 5 days with constant updates. Sometimes it is several times a day. How can a game possibly require several updates daily?,1
"The Dungeon Keeper games were  amazing. This game had the potential to be amazing. That potential was assassinated by greedy, immoral micro-transaction practices that make the game absolutely unplayable without spending big bucks. Shame on you EA.",1
Idii esyyusjshishuj  Kii yyleuehikd and ne! Uuduyou you know when you're free of worked to,5
Extremely slow to advance with long wait periods. I have played only a week and it takes days to save up enough gold and stones to level up a rook.,2
Ridiculous amounts of micro-transactions that get to the point of you having to wait over a week for a room of you dont want to spend multiple dollars.,1
"Would rate higher, but I saved up gems to get 3 imps and now I cant get the third to work on buildings.  He just stands around fix this and I will rate it higher.",3
Game keep crashing and disconnecting during raids and campaign some units are too powerful and matchmaking is a mess.,1
Since the update thw game is near unplayable.   Ridiculous costs to upgrade amd time to do upgrades has gone through the roof.   Challenging to stay interested in this game.,1
Just a cash grab from the start.,1
"First of all, it's a shameless, money-grabbing clone. Secondly, they outright destroyed a classic franchise, riding the nostalgia the name brings.   This is a prime example of how to NOT make a game. Please, people... check out the original, and you'll see the damage.   This is a waiting game. Or, pay to not wait, only to wait again.",1
"Hands down not worth playing. Wish I didn't waste any time, either way though uninstalled.",1
"Seriously a horrible app. Goes into a cyclical reboot if you don't give it permission to your google circles. Until you allow it to do so, you won't see the main menu. Bad game from a bad publisher.",1
Anyone who expects a phone game to be the same as a computer game must not have picked up on anything by now or they have never played a phone app before. The game is free to play but they have to make money some how. Most people don't understand the kind of work that goes into making a game and then they think game makers and animators want to work for free. Do you have any idea how much the schooling costs alone? Yeah it's not the same as the computer versions....boohoo. Grow patients and then play.,5
Can't do anything without paying.,1
the worst scam that's ever come from in-app purchasing games,1
Original game is way better then  EA sellout version. You will never know the true experience of dungeon keeper.,1
This game absolutely ruined a favorite childhood game of mine with in app purchases. I'd have paid for the stupid thing even.,1
This game is a ploy to try and such money out of you. The game is more or less unplayable unless you engage in their  ludicrous and overpriced micro transactions. It is one of the most exploitive games I've ever played and it spits in the face of the classic Dungeon keeper series that we all know and love.,1
"Shame on you EA on charging the masses of casual gamers money within the game to progress further. Charging someone $70 withinin game is unacceptable. Sure you can argue players don't need to wait pay the money to play, but at the cost of waiting 24 hours before we can make the next move? No no no.",1
Ea almost made the game perfect just now my rooms keep blacking out in missions and when i place traps and my nights dont move from where i deploy them when im in missions were im being attacked otherwise great game but please fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So now my imps are pretending to work i pay to upgrade i spike trap and it takez the money and nothing happens then im unable to dig out stone i tried contacting ea games but it s to complicated i wish this was as easy as it ws when i started,1
They ruined a great franchise as usual. I can't wait to dance on EA's grave once they go bankrupt soon enough.,1
"They ruined the game! Making you pay real cash for imps is lame. Plus, my dungeon was always attacked when I wasn't there. EA messed up yet another classic game! Stick to your platform games.",1
A sad mutation of one of the greatest games of the 90s. Sorry guys this is just not living up to the dungeon keeper name,1
"I'm of the opinion that a decent game is worth paying for.  I also think that 60.00 for a AAA game is fair. So when a game offers in game currency at up to 99.99 it better be the best game out there, and 99.99 better be able to buy the full game. The way this game is set up is definitely not worth spending money on.",2
"First, don't be fooled by the high average rating.  Dungeon Keeper manipulates its ratings by using an in-game feedback mechanism that first asks the player whether s/he intends to give the game  5 stars.  If so, the player is sent to Google Play to leave a review.  But if not, the player is instead directed to some EA feedback form.   Second, as the other one star ratings will tell you, Dungeon Keeper makes you wait and wait and wait or pay and pay and pay.  Want to expand your dungeon?  It takes as long as a full calendar day to remove a single block--something that must be done hundreds of times to build a dungeon of any size.  So the rest of the merits and demerits of the game are beside the point.   If you want to enjoy Dungeon Keeper, I suggest buying the original and/or its sequel.  Good Old Games sells them for cheap.",1
,1
This game is a copy of the original except for the fact that you now need to wait over 80 hours to clear the main floor of the game. They have complete broken the game mechanics and have made it so it is extremely hard for anyone to give them a negative rating directly form their app.,1
They actually expect me to wait a long time or spend a boatload of money just to fully optimize my dungeon?  What are they thinking?,1
They will milk you dry. Just another game to steal more money from you. Don't bother downloading this game if you want to keep your wallet,1
not original not cheap not interesting,1
Frequently errors while loading. Takes a while to load. Sometimes not able to assign builders due to bugs.,3
All the time EA be always bad and use bad ethics to be more bad always the time and even more so now,1
,1
I played this on PC when it was out. Pretty good game. Hope the app is Just as good.,5
Very slow progression when playing for free.  Some technical flaws too.   Does not seem to be very tolerant of server disconnects.  Artwork is pretty good hence the two stars.,2
This game will not have a very long life on my tablet if it keeps reseting and losing all of my progress as it just did. I was finally making a lot of progress after spending a lot of time playing and now suddenly I'm starting over and I don't understand why.,2
"This mobile incarnation of Dungeon Keeper is a testament to the many loathsome practices of modern 'casual' games, or possibly just another example of EA trying to make a buck off of the people who actually like video games. Really, it would be hard to say that Dungeon Keeper is any worse than Clash of Clans, but herein lies the problem: the only reason why you would choose to play this game over Clash of Clans is because of the Dungeon Keeper IP- yet anything likable about the Dungeon Keeper brand has been thrown behind an infinitely expanding pay wall. If you want to pay to play a great dungeon keeper game then go over to Good Old Games and pay $6 for the original, any money spent in this game will just fund more abominations in the future.",1
"How EA has sunk you so low. First making  it tough to do anything without out throwing wads of cash, Second with only allowing 5 star ratings to post on the Play Store unless you manually go to this section, Third because it is only mildly comparable to the first game (and I have played both). So I raise my cup to you and drink to your memory, for EA has truely trashed a classic.",1
Box for typing your name never comes out. Can't even start the game.,1
"The free to paid ratio is completely off... The way imps take forever to build, and are extremely pricey to attain.  The game is very costly to build items and update, and gets ridiculous the longer you play the game. Definitely do not recommend.",1
Does EA pay people to rate five stars..,1
Not a shameless clash of clans clone.,1
,1
I cant believe anyone would compare this to the originals. Isn't anyone tired of the pay to play model?  EA/mythic I would've gladly paid up to 40$ for a port of DK2.  But I wouldn't even put a penny into this wannabe Simpson's tapped out ripoff. Waste of time/money depending on how you play it.,1
Make it a pay for game 5 bucks or what ever and get rid of ingame purchases.  Ruined the game. I want to be able sit down and actually play a game in 15 minutes and not pay 99$ to do so. Rip off,1
I was annoyed that I got notifications even when the option was turned off.,2
"Dungeon Keeper has all the potential to be a good smartphone game. Unfortunately, it's not a good game. As a matter of fact, it's quite terrible.  You barely get through the tutorial before you start dealing with incredibly long wait times, and you can only speed it up with gems. A lot of them. And they aren't cheap, or easy to try and earn in the game.  Save your time, and save your money. It's not worth it.",1
"Its from EA, of course its going to be a freaking joke. Glitchy, hard to move small objects, in ""bearded brigade"" I kill off the first wave, and they respawn inside walls, and walk through walls. Seem to be indestructible, using cluck off and x4 or x5 minions and they plow through my minons, walk through walls, don't trigger traps. Don't download this game, horrible!",1
Beyond bad.  No fun at all.,1
"A free to play game should allow you to play the game, without being hindered in such a way that it requires in app purchases to continue. This game fails at that miserably by requiring that you either wait 4 to 24 hours to continue or pay a ridiculous price to speed up that wait time. If you have to wait several hours up to a full day before you can continue playing a game, then you aren't playing the game. You're watching paint dry.",1
As a huge fan of DK1 & 2 I downloaded this without thought. And it is a lovely adaptation to a new platform. Familiar characters populate a new game. Its easy ans intuitive to learn. I expected that a free game would have a cost to move forward at some point. And for DK I was willing to consider paying. I would have paid for the app.   But it has an immediate artificial bottleneck - imps. The lifeblood of any dungeon and to get more than two you must either play for weeks in 5 minute increments or spend $20,1
I tried. There just isn't a game to play here.,1
Complete cash grab. Worthless as a game. Retains none of the mechanics or themes that made the property wonderful.,1
"I would rather pay once to play all I want at a normal pace. In fact, GOG has the classic version of this that does just that.",1
"Instead of spending hundreds on this poor remake, you can pick up the original two games for $10 elsewhere online. That's a much better deal than this obvious cash grab of a game.",1
Very slow progression with constant reminders that you can pay to move on.,1
"The game doesn't seem to give you much to do if you don't pay, except in small doses.  Things can take hours even in the beginning.",3
Too much pay for too much wait.  Uninstalling.,1
Mm       You 2,1
This game only records the five star rating if rated from with the in-game prompt.  Rate it in the app store and skip their star boosting scheme,1
First EA kills Bullfrog studios and then they release this pay to play crap. I would love another real dungeon keeper game not this garbage.,1
"I normally don't write reviews like this but felt compelled to.  Dungeon Keeper is based on the very popular Bullfrog series of games that go back to my childhood. This game is only similar in name. To do anything useful in this game you will be charged for it, which I don't mind paying for a game, but not to the point where the game is unplayable. I'd gladly pay 5-10$ for a good game as a one time charge. This game will cost you hundreds.  EA has unfortunately turned their area of the mobile gaming market to a massive nickle and dime money grab. I suggest trying the game and if you feel the same way, don't support this company and uninstall the game.",1
"EA's greedy money scams all over again. They take something you love from childhood and turn it into a CoC remake that falls flat on it's face, then require microtransactions to get -anything- done. 24 hours to mine a single wall? Don't worry, you can spend gems to speed it up! Want more imps? Here, buy our 99$ dollar pack of gems and spend them all in two days then be stuck again! But seriously, EA has thrown a wonderful franchise in the mud.",1
"Slow, boring, constantly begging for cash.  What a huge letdown.  Hey, EA! Speed it up, and let me pay once to purchase and we're good.  Ok?",1
Pay or wait... If you want to actually be able to play this game you better be willing to spend some of your cash... or wait insanely long amounts of time for the most simple of tasks,1
Microtransactions make this unplayable,1
,1
This misses the fun and point of its namesake franchise and delivers a dreadful payscheme to boot. Requesting me to rate your game 5 stars after five minutes of gameplay is requesting an uninformed opinion. I found nothing redeeming here.,1
Game glitches all the time where it was annoying to play also you have to wait hours upon hours or spend money to play this game don't install.,1
Insane prices or insane wait times.  Your choice,1
"Cash grab, pure and simple",1
This game suuuuuuucks.,1
Needs to be more like the original games. Or at least lower the dig times on the hard dirt,1
"Not only was this game very poorly ported from PC, the in-app rating system actually filters out ratings below 5 stars. The combination of poor quality and underhanded ratings boosting makes this a loser. Do not get under any circumstances.",1
Worst of the worst when it comes to grinding.,1
"Just let us buy the game for a set price, and have that be the end of it.",1
"It doesn't seem to actually double the imps work the time is the same whether you slap them or not, thus longer build time.. 5 star if and when that changes",3
"I read all the reviews before playing the game. Everyone was complaining about how expensive it is, and how everything takes a long time to complete. Ive been playing for a week and have not come into any problems. I really dont see a reason to buy gems anyways. The game is excellent, they did a great job on it. Only gave it 4 stars cause its not better than clash of clans, obviously.",4
Clearly ripped off clash of clans with just enough different content so they dont get taken to court even more emphasis on pay to win,1
"Once you get done with the tutorial, you're better off uninstalling the game. Doing anything past that requires either waiting several hours to a couple days to be able to build more or summon helper imps without using real cash. This is also a very high resolution game so you will most likely not be able to run it without a higher end phone or new model tablet. Even if you're a casual phone gamer, this game isn't for you. Save your cash for a better game.",1
,1
free to play rubbish but this time with what was a classic game and from a big publisher. crazy pay wall to try and get anything done.,1
"This version of Dungeon Keeper is horrible, don't waste your time",1
really just a tower defense game with a small phrasebook and a huge pricetag.,2
"You will need too many gems that you will not get unless you psy for them. I really liked the PC version, but this one is not good at all.",2
EA are you serious to greedy guys to greedy,1
"If you follow the in game link to rate anything under 5 stars, the game does NOT bring you here. Instead you're redirected to an EA site to bury bad reviews. Horrible company run by greedy and incompetent buffoons. Just look at their recent track record.",1
Turn around. Do not play this game. Another classic example of EA destroying IP in the name of money grabbing.,1
How to ruin one of the best games ever. Do a half hearted port and then slow it down so you can charge me money to  speed things up.   EA sucks,1
,1
This game is a perfect example of how the game industry as a whole is broken. In order to do even the simplest task it takes large amounts of time unless of course you use expensive gems. The point of this game is not fun no it is to force you to pay so you can pretend you are having fun. This game is so bad that people who choose less than 5 from the in game rating screen are not brought to this reading page. We have gotten to the point where companies have to force us to like their games.,1
"Error keeps popping up saying that it cannot connect. And a tiny little window pops up saying LOW MEMORY. But I know for a fact that I have plenty of memory, please fix this!",1
"As a guild leader, I would like to have a history on who donated minions and who has taken minions. Who is active and who isn't.   Keep losing connection and the game is trying to get me to start a new game. I'm losing connection more than actually playing the game.  Update; getting real tied of losing connection while connected to my Wifi.",1
This reboot is lacking in many ways in comparison to the original. I'd uninstall it. Stay away if you can.,1
"Everything is gated with a timer you can bypass with gems purchased with real money. If you choose not to spend any real money expect your play sessions to be extremely short. I really tried to like this game as a fan of the old Bullfrog games, but this is unbearable. It is an affront to fans of the series. I would rather have paid $15 for a decent mobile game take on the series than this mindless hurry-up-and-wait piece of garbage which does its best to nickel and dime you to death. Avoid this app!",1
,1
Forces you to give 5 stars only in app. Have to pay for stuff to enjoy.,1
They totally ruined the DK name with this pay or wait game.  Even the creator of DK says this game  is a joke.  Very limited actual play unless you pay the way over priced  amounts.  Unbalanced unless you pay.,1
"It's a fun game, but the CONSTANT nagging to use an account to find the people in my ""circle"" is bothersome. I can't play without it dc'ing me multiple times then having to wait to reconnect. Uninstalling if this keeps up.",2
I looks fun,5
"Not gonna get into too much detail.  However, game is terrible, like a bad version of farmville that's meant to suck away all your hard earned money.",1
Just another money siphoner. Profound meh.,1
Waiting times are ridiculous. One day for one block? Seriously? Old game much much better.,1
Literally everything in this game begs you to spend money.  Very very greedy piece of crap.  EA isn't even trying anymore.,1
Please refer to Nerd^3's video on YouTube for everything that's wrong with this game.,1
I un-installed it.,1
"Get the original for a pc. This version will cost a lot to play, whether its cash or several hours of your life waiting.",1
Tracking down a copy of Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2 for PC is a better idea than playing this watered down pay to not wait version of a classic.,1
"Aside from having little to do with the original, it's just another pay2win mobile game copycat that brings nothing new other than digging through dirt. Whoopee.",2
"This is not ok. It's a time wasting game where you need to pay boatloads of real life money to dig a hole. The original games are so much better, this is outrageous. easily one star, why is there no zero star option?",1
Way better then Clash of Clans.,4
"As Molyneux has stated, ""This is ridiculous"".  Check out, pixel dungeon.  Nothing like this, but a worthwhile free game no doubt.",1
Takes to long to build anything. Never had a chance to like it and it never justified my money for speed ups. Just charge a few bucks and not make the game sub par with the constant need to pay to get anything done.,2
Horrible branding of an old classic.,1
...that is all.,1
Boring pay to complete. You can hardly call this a game.,1
,1
"Pure crap. If u don't spend money in game, u don't get far.....",1
,1
Ridiculous wait times make this game too much about sitting around. The game shamelessly flaunts that it amounts to a giant cash grab. Add in the crashes and freezes and there's no reason to download this. Do yourself a favor and just buy the classic PC versions. Then you can enjoy a much better game that you can literally play all you want.,1
"Good looking, with slick production values, but soul-crushingly tedious. If you don't cough up some cash, most of your time will be spent waiting.",1

"As a disclaimer I'm a huge fan of the original.  Putting that aside this is mediocre at best.  Tap tap, waaaiiit, repeat.  You go to siege, you drop your creatures and waaaiit.  I see nothing compelling here gameplay wise.   Now factoring in the original, this is a disaster.  You started with one of the best games ever and all you had to do was not screw it up!  What is next on your todo list EA Mythic, tattooing Kate Beckinsales face?",1

Truly dragging the dungeon keeper IP through the mud here. The only thing worthwhile this app did was make me dig out and reinstall DK2.,1
Love it,2
"Was a pretty decent game as I started. I wasn't getting attacked much and had time to build, but now that I've gotten a little further I'm losing hundreds of thousands of resources a day. I can't save enough to get anywhere and I'm not buying gems just to safeguard my dungeon. That whole thing wouldn't be to bad but someone apparently forgot the concept of seeking revenge. So when I get attacked and go to seek revenge it finds a random dungeon to attack. Completely not worth spending real money on.",1
Completely ruined a great title by being a unrepentant cash grab. Not worth playing unless you are willing to throw money at it for every little thing you want to do.,1
Good game but hate that you have to buy to get far enough,5
Don't get hooked on this game. You will soon (too soon) realise you MUST buy gems in order to continue playing. Prices are absolutly ridiculous!... Too bad and a very bitter tasting bite from EA. Thumbs down!,1
I hate what they did to this game. I would have gladly paid for the game rather than being prevented from playing anymore after a short time unless you start doing overpriced micro transactions that only buy you a short extension,1
Love this game! It needs more players,5
People are rating this like it was a game. It's not! This is clearly a timer simulator.,1
"Just play Clash of Clans. Much better balance, and it's actually fun.",1
"Game kept resetting on me, placing me right back into the beginning of the game. Played the original dungeon keeper, and although this has that dark sense of humor, it lacks just about everything else. Really disappointed with not only this direction that the game has taken, but also the lack of response we will get for this. The gem system is rather silly, and not to mention extremely expensive. During the tutorial stages you are stressed to spend gems in order to speed up everything.",1
This is an embarrassment when it comes to using the dungeon keeper name. Makes me glad I can still boot up the original in dosbox. This should be a $4.99-9.99 actual title that someone can just own and play. This free to play crap is terrible.,1
"It's totally times based. People that are complaining are mainly the ones who spend real money like whimps n are impatient. Fun lil time killer n it's challenging. Keep in mind tho, this is a app based game and if FAR off from the original game. No compair so don't complain otherwise. On a aide note tho you should be able to unclaim a mine n destroy rooms to it's easier to rearrange.",4
"I love the IP, and really want to give this 5 stars. Just seeing it available for download gave it an automatic 5 star rating from me. However, a few issues have taken some stars away.  - 1 star Money to play. Yes, I fully understand how the free to play model works. I don't begrudge a company for making money. But there's NO excuse to offer a purchase of $99, and $50 for gems to use in the game. At that price, one could get one or two FULL actual computer/console games. If I pay $20, I expect a full program with no need to purchase anything more ever again. This ""free"" version should have been a demo, with a (at most) $20 full version.  - 1 star Times are way too long. I know that's how the game is set up; play a couple of minutes a day, but we have to slap off another star for...  -1 star for ALWAYS ONLINE. EA's Always Online policy stinks. We're to play anywhere for just a few minutes a day, but I can't play anywhere that doesn't allow internet connections. I can only play at home.",2
"This game feels like  a clash of clans clone, but with worse performance, longer timers, and more expectation to pay $$. I login once a day to command my 2 imps, run 1 raid, then quit off because nothing will happen again for at least an hour (maybe 20/30 minutes for another raid if I'm patient).  Unlike Clash of Clans, you can't even effectively modify your defenses while you're waiting, because digging soft dirt requires free imps. And I haven't found a way to watch replays of attacks, so I have no idea how to improve the defenses anyway. This might be a good game in the future, but for now I have better things to be doing.",2
While I was hoping this would be a good take on the old Dungeon Keeper - it really amounts to a marketing ploy to suck money out of you through ridiculous in game purchases that makes it a pay to play.  No thanks - much better off installing the old games and playing them.,1
"I installed this game on a recommendation from a friend and its been nothing but buggy from the begining. It has trouble booting, crashes in the middle of gameplay, and forgets progress you made. I played a couple of hours finally and it backtracked all the progress made since I started today. Its not worth the code its written in.",1
"... someone will eventually make a clone without the horrible pacing, micropayments or nagging.",1
After playing this game for about a week the imps or workers will not function anymore. You click to dig and nothing happens.,1
"Seriously, you could BUY 20 copies of the original dungeon keeper (full version) for you and all of your friends for the amount that EA tries to scam out of you for a couple hours of play time. If you DON'T pay, game time is limited to 5 minutes per day of menu surfing and then waiting 24 hours for actions to finish. Fail.",1
Disgusting in-app purchases that are just horrible.,1
"Too much is wrong with this game, 24 hours to remove one block?   That effectively makes this game useless.  The gems/productivity scale is way off!  When I tried to rate the app lower, it redirected me to the EA website! Malware tactics, EA, you're garbage!  Stop giving EA money, they hate and resent you as a customer!",1
"It was great until I had to enter my name and it wouldn't let me,fix this and  I'll get the game again and change my review",1
Free to play ten minutes per day. Wait or pay nonsense makes up the entirety of game play.,1
Pay to play.,1
game is unplayable without making in app purchases,1
Why in the world would i wait 24 hours to have my imp clear out a spot. Do not get this app amd waste your time or money on it,1
Give better rating but.....  tried in game purchase. Money was taken but haven't received purchased,1
"After playing around with it for a couple days, this sure could be a fun game, but when you run out of your first stock of gems and dig for hours and hours just to get enough to get a third imp, you come to realize this game is designed to make you pay not to be frustrated.  Constant server reconnection errors and another strange error that made it seem like my dungeon had been wiped don't help the experience.  Otherwise the implementation is very good, including nice graphics and voice acting.",2
,1
It's just an in-app-purchase money grab.,1
Pay to play,1
It just really sucks.,1
,1
"The game itself is quiet fun, Once you get past the problems. it takes 4 hours to 24 hours to break down 1 square in places in your dungeon, that not too bad at the start as there is plenty of space to dig out that only takes 4 seconds, however once you build 2 or 3 rooms on your dungeon you can't build any more without mining this harder rock and installing new rooms becomes slow and rather annoying. (with out spending lots on gems)  flying enemies are also stupid. Im creating a dungeon underground yet flying enemies can miraculously fly over walls and into other rooms.  room defensives (although good for the player) can also attack over walls into nearby rooms which is also stupid you are in an underground dungeon there is no way things can attack over walls as above the walls would be a roof that is cut away so you can see your dungeon top down.  Minions suffer the same miraculous ability if they can shoot. when your dungeon is attacked you get no idea of what the other keeper used to breach your defenses. all in all it's not a very good game. fun and for lovers of the original a walk back in time to remember the original that this title plays basic lip service too.(char limited",2
"Its not ""free""  they need to re assess their gem economy.. make it a bit more economical...",4
sucks,1
,1
"So i was in the mood of playing a game like clash of clans (which i cant run on this device for some reason), so i ended up finding this... game. It wouldnt let me even start without connecting my google account, and after waiting for ten minutes, it fails to connect. I then retry, then the game crashes. I retry for the last time and get an error. I promptly uninstalled.",1
"EA had a fantastic franchise that they completely ruined through micro-transactions and overly-complicated resource management. CHARGE FOR THE GAME, then make it free! Don't make a game ""free"" then charge money just to play it!",1
Every choice in this game has been designed to squeeze money out of you. Unfortunately that and a few design choices take all the fun out of this game. Seriously if you want to play dungeon keeper you should look on amazon for a copy of the pc game. It is probably cheaper in the long run even with the inflated prices which the game is going for..,1
I'm poor. So I can't enjoy this game.,1
"This app tried to censor contents by asking for 1-4 or 5 stars. Bad graphics, poor design, large download from slow servers, also combined to inform my opinion.",1
EA actively discourages users from leaving poor ratings.,1
I don't mind the pay to play model but the cost of the gems in this game is ridiculous when you look at what you get for them.  It did prompt me to go buy DK Gold for $5 though.,1
It doesn't save my game. I have to start over EVERY time.  Please fix. Its kinda lame.,1
"EA doesn't care about gameplay mechanics, only making money. Do NOT download this game.",1
The freemium model used in this app is insanely bad! Basically unplayable without paying! Its sad as this app ruins such a good IP,1
PAY TO PLAY,1
Awesome game,5
Also needs constant network connection as far as I can tell which makes it unplayable for me on my train commute.,2
In their right minds scored this pile more than one star? Its awful and expects to be paid for being awful. It should be called dungeon waiting. EA you are the worst.,1
Protest EA's abuse of rating system.,1
Highlights EA's business model. The pay to pay. Pay to progress to higher payment options.,1
Never have I played a game that forces me to pay so much for so little. Shame on you EA!,1
The in-game rating system is specifically set up so that only 5-star ratings are passed through to the play store. This blatant dishonesty should be curtailed by the app store itself and if not then by users.  The only way to play this game is similar to face book games.   In that same vane this game becomes pay to win nonsense with no appreciable advancement for days otherwise.,1
"OK I can handle that after the tutorial you start digging but not being told what a block is or how long it'll mine for without verification is a pain. And then after 30 minutes my tablet, which is on mute told me verbally that ""your imps are seeking attention"" during a conference call with the CEO of my company. That's an immediate uninstall. Tldr Awful gameplay Awful intrusion Awful annoying",1
"If my choices are to wait for days to mine gems or to pay EA to buy them, I'd rather play the original DK and uninstall this junk.",1
,1
I liked this game until my imps stopped building... my resources are taken but the imps never build... it's bugged.,2
Anything do to long too take.,1
This game is trying to milk money from you like no other game did before. Nothing in common with the Dungeon Keeper of old. Shame on you EA.,1
"Another Castle Clash/clash of the clans game, just with the classic DK characters. Sad remake. Uninstalled within an hour. The good news is I found my originalDK discs so I was playing the REAL DK the same day",1
"If you liked the original Dungeon Keeper, or the sequel, this is not the game for you.",1
"I'd read about all the controversy surrounding the app but still decided to give it a try because I love the old Dungeon Keeper games.  This game only shares a couple thematic elements with the original series, the gameplay can barely be even called ""related.""  This game is just one more cash grab that ruins an awesome ip.  It takes the Pay to Win model and turns it into a Pay to Play model, not that the former was any good to begin with.  This game could have potential but in its current state it is just garbage as doing anything fun requires you to shell out cash. It's truly sad because if this game was closer to the original Dungeon Keeper series I would happily shell out money up front to play it without all of the Pay to Win elements.  Its clear that a lot of work was put into the game; the graphics and animations are pretty awesome.  Too pad the only way to actually play the game, ie have any kind of fun, requires the purchasing of those stupid gems. What a bummer. Let me know when I can pay a couple bucks to to remove all that garbage completely.",1
Cant name dungeon and i really want to play,1
A game where they've managed to replace almost all game mechanics with some sort of purchase plan. No thanks.,1
"But takes forever to get stuff done. More waiting around then playing the game. And way too expensive.  I have this on a tablet, I tried rebooting cause I thought that would help sync the game an it hasn't,  I have default walls, and I have cartoonish looking creatures apart from seeing graphically better - looking ones for several seconds.  The game can do A LOT better compared to the original  version, which I intend on getting instead, and will uninstall this game.",2
This game is nothing but a crappy excuse to push us into overpriced micro transactions.,1
Micro transactions are absurd in this game,1
It's not even trying to hide the fact it is a money grab. Mythic is ruined. DAoC days are over. :(,1
,1
"Free to start, pay to play",1
Ruined an excellent game/franchise with excessive micro-transactions.,1
The games pace is abysmal unless you spend.,1
"Horrid. If you want a perfect example of how to ruin a good concept with pay gates and micro transactions, look no further. If you want to play a fun game on your android, move along. Kingdom Rush is good.",1
Sad.,1
A great PC game made free to play.  The game is unplayable without expending LOTS of cash. Skip this. Its a steaming pile of EA.,1
"I loved Dungeon Keeper (and DK2) and it's a shame EA developed this under that brand. The game play has very little in common with the originals and it has completely lost its edgy-ness and dark-humored fun.   This game has no objectives other than to upgrade things in order to upgrade some more. and once everything is upgraded, then the real fun starts: now you can keep upgrading. Of course upgrading things either takes forever or costs you ""gems"" which can be had for real money.   Maybe if there were a campaign mode? or any actual goal, this game wouldn't feel like it was designed solely to empty your pockets",1
"I played for about 15 minutes, next day it reset me. Uninstalled",1
Tho whole point of tree game is to take your nostalgia for dungeon keeper and rob you of your money.,1
"Way to ruin a great franchise, EA. Uninstalled.",1
This could be a great game but sadly is not.  After time playing its buggy as hell and 24 hours to dig out one square is outrageous.  I never played the original so nothing to compare to.  The worst is warlocks walking into walls and attacking inner rooms.  EA you could have a hit but right now you dont.  Fix please.,1
,1
A sickening concept of what EA tries to pass off as a game. Either pay money to win or wait months to gain.,1
EA doesn't deserve any credit for this rip off.,1
,2
"I hate you, you ruin everything you touch, I have hated you since you destroyed Westwood studios. I downloaded this trash just to give you a bad rating.",1
Commonly lose connection in middle of raid which results in loss of resources spent on raid and no rewards given.   Seems like microtransactions are necessary to progress in game at a certain point. No possible way to earn enough gems to progress without paying.   $99 is best value?  Ridiculous.,1
"Another terrible pay to win game and money grab by EA. I understand EA is running a business, but if they continue to operate without any regard for the consumer I won't be very interested in any of their products. Plenty of companies put out great products without trying to squeeze out every possible dollar and still have great profits.",1
Game is insulting in how it tries to milk money from you with its abhorrent wait times. Need to clear out an area on the outer edges of your dungeon? Be prepared for half a week or more at minimum to pass unless you want to invest. Wish for a 0 out of 5 option.,1
I also like how they are funnelling bad reviews away.  Do not play this game.,1
"The major flaw with this game is the pay wall is too large at level three which is about two days into the game almost cannot be surpassed with time. In fact it took me over a week to do it, and the problem is that when you are attacked you start from the bottom but you cannot defend yourself against higher level people because they have more resources than you. Game is horribly unbalanced and is nearly broken for that reason",2
,2
"Denngg after trying out this out, I have to say EA really is one of the worst company on earth! It's unbelievable how much they want you to pay just to play this game. Uninstall now.",1
Not enough to do if you don't spend money,2
,1
Built up a dungeon only to find that almost everytime I log in it wants me to start over? What kind of BS is that? I cant get into my dungeon and it still logs into my Google+ this game needs some serious work.,1
"I wanted to like it, but the abominable micro-transactions made that impossible.",1
EA you are the worst developer in history with your silly terrible and awful cash grab games. You guys ruin everything you touch. No wonder You guys are the worst company in america,1
"Original Dungeon Keeper was outstanding RTS game. This version has no dynamics, no humor and no strategy. It is extremely boring and can be hardly distinguished from Clash of Clans and others. It is brightest confirmation that mobile game industry goes to dead end. There are good ideas but no one wants to implement them.",1
"EA has done it again, ruined a great franchise (Command and Conquer never forget) and in the process gamed the rating system. The only reason this game has a rating as high as it does is because the game tricks people into making you give 5 stars. No wonder they're voted the worst company two years running.",1
"Ive been a big fan of DK ever since the first one came out in 1997. Sadly, this game is NOTHING at all like the original games, aside from the name and some of the visuals. Gameplay is nothing at all like it.  So why just 1 star? Several reasons:   - [ 1 ] - This game is 95% waiting, 5% playing. You have to wait super long for everything, or else you have to pay for gems. Im all for IAP when they are balanced right, but this game is so bad about it that you pretty much HAVE to pay if you want to play else wait 3 years.  - [ 2 ] - The ratings for this game on googleplay are a sham. The game has an in app window that pops up that lets you either rate it 5 stars automatically, or offers you a tedius, annoying second option to actually prompts you to send an email telling EA what they could do to make it 5 stars. This is a cheap and horribly false way of getting a high rating for your app.  I would have easily paid 20 bucks for a REAL remake of Dungeon Keeper for the android. I wont be spending ANY money on this, another blatant EA money grab.",1
"The game itself runs great and looks great, but the gameplay leaves something to be desired.  The long period removal of blocks, while understandable, seems a bit over-the-top.",3
Main issue being slow game pace,1
Pay to play,1
but the blatant cash grab was too much.,1
"Once again EA is trying to suck hundreds of dollars out of players. Instead of releasing a great mobile remake of s cult classic, they created this poor excuse of a game, ruined by F2P system. Read or watch some reviews from major websites and you will see why. And if you don't want to pay, you will end up spending DAYS to build a single room. EA has already won the ""Worst company of the year"" award TWICE in a row and I'm sure that they will get it again and again. STAY AWAY!!!",1
"Although I always find pay games such as this frustrating, there is no doubt that a lot of love and quality work was put into this reimagining of the original Dungeon Keeper franchise. Having played for several levels now, I believe it really isn't that bad at all nor as horrible as I thought upon hearing that our beloved DK was going this route. Still I am rather upset about the fact that you are seriously nickel and dimed to death. Waiting hours for a gem block to be destroyed is maddening.  Money grab.",2
"1. EA and Google want unrestricted access (yaya...just like the whole internet) but, based on my reading (gasp!)of the EULA they are crossing lines I'm not comfortable with. 2. I like the idea of time based progression (ex-eve online player) but this seems arbitrarily SLLOOOOOWWW as a way to charge you ridiculous amounts of money to speed things up. 3. Requires a active internet connection to play the game (DEAL-BREAKER!!!) which means you cant play this in most of the places I play mobile games.  In summation, If you don't mind intrusive  EULA agreements, have LOTS of cash to waste on 1's & 0's and want a game that requires a net connection, this seems pretty slick and entertaining.",1
,4
Don't believe the score EA has made it so you can only give the game a 5 star rating from inside the game. The game has the worst free to play implementation I have ever witnessed if you don't sink a small boat load of money into it you won't get any real enjoyment out of this huge steaming pile of...  Check out the Metacritic score before you waste your time.,1
Not much variety or complexity,2
"This is a micro-transaction click-fest that requires no skill, only money and/or patience. This is part of the reason I no longer buy EA products. EA, you can keep this crappy excuse for a game, I'll just install my original DK and DK2 under Dos Box.",1
Full of crap and micro transaction,1
"I chose the ""1-4 stars"" rating option and was brought to their site instead of google play. No EA, 1 stars need visibility. The game is pedantic and adds to the boring drivel of the mountainous amount of freemium games out there.",1
It's really too bad that EA is a part of the dirty practice of these pay to win mobile games.  It is far too expensive to be able to play this game in any reasonable sense,1
Not only did they ruin a  fantastic pc game but they try to mask 1-4 star reviews by diverting people to ea's website instead of submitting feedback with Google play.  The score you see is not an accurate reflection of this crapfest of a game.,1
"This is exactly what is wrong with mobile gaming. This ""Pay to Win"" stuff has got to stop. EA will be the worst company in America again for a 3rd year in a row.",1
,1
The orginal dungeon keeper was great just go get that for $5,1
"First off... Graphics, touch control, looney DK voice and humor etc... All that is pretty good. I loved the original but didn't get to play it much. Was looking forward to revisiting it.   However, the cost of gems and the need for them to actually play the game is poorly balanced. And that is about the nicest way to put it. So much so that I so far have refused to even purchase the token I like your game and want to support you' option. But the 4.99 pile of gems gives you little more capability than the initial freebie set.  I do not want a free game. But I also do not want to pay more than I would for a brand new blockbuster console title just to get to end game content on a 90's App Store rehash. For the recommended pile of GEMS at 20$ you should effectively gain access to the entire content of the game  and the game should be a complete port of the original (gameplay was much more in depth in the original PC version). Instead you just get the ability to click through timers for maybe a few days worth of game play before ending up right where you started.   This  is a one star that could easily be made into a 4-5 star rating just by changing  how gems are handled.",1
This should have been a redux of the old PC games. Instead it is EA trying to cash in on clash of clans. Its a terrible rip off. Dont waste your time.,1
"3 missions in,  they make you name you dungeon,  but when I go to type it closes teeing keyboard.  Exit and restart don't help and phone reboot doesn't either.  I'm deleting the game.",1
"Almost impossible to build without buying gems with cash, takes 4 hours to clear one block.  I'd rather buy the game then it be pay to win, or pay-to-play-today",1
A diabolical success!! This game is my favorite EVER on my phone. Great job developers,5
This has very little in common with the classic Dungeon Keeper game.    Can't enjoy the game without spending money almost immediately. Pace of the game is painfully slow without purchases.,1
"This series was originally witty, awesome, creative, and as awesome as your imagination could dream of. But what EA did to this game is horrible. Micro transactions have ruined real gaming. Now its all about 5 minutes of entertainment and freaking 10 hours of wait. Its a shame what modern gaming has done to many beloved franchises. The only dungeon you are keeping is your own by downloading this crap. Nintendo has never done that with any of their franchises. Nintendo 4 Life!!!",1
,1
Probably fine if you don't mind spending lots of money to proceed. Otherwise it's basically unplayable because everything takes so long.,1
"Hopefully Google Play updates their TOU to forbid apps from routing negative ratings to external sites, while routing positive reviews to the play store.",1
"EA likes releasing games with no gameplay, pay to win, play forever to accomplish nothing.  Just like the Dragon age game, this one plays bad, and wants money money money.  Very shallow.  Avoid like the plague.",1
Is more entertaining that waiting for this game.,1
"I used to love the desktop  version of DK I I. EA managed to take a fun, well paced game and turn it into an utter bore in an attempt to get as much money as possible out of players. The constant game notifications are truly annoying. Why should I have to check in every half hour in order to play? Don't waste your time on this download.",1
Phhhhhhh. It's not the same,1
"Implies free updates only come with 5-star reviews, and if you try to give it a lower rating, it sends you to a feedback form instead of registering your rating. Very deceptive.",1
"I thought this would be very good at first, but after a few hours of play, I realized that it is just a money grab.  Free game play is glacially slow. Takes it WAY beyond boring. Literally days or weeks of just waiting, with nothing to do.  Don't play unless you like to pay. If you get a kick out of blowing cash, it might be a good game. Otherwise, skip it.",1
"This is just another clash of clans, with nice graphics.  The wait times are outrageous, and everything is geared towards spending gems=money.",1
The worst kind of microtransaction garbage ive ever played.,1
Didn't even bother to play it I already new EA would try to turn it into a quick cash sponge way to ruin an awesome series,1
Don't install,1
"Was looking for something ""DIFFERENT"" to play while I wait for upgrades to finish on COC not the exact same thing. Uninstalled 10mins in.",1
That's sad.,1
Way to much money being charged and almost unplayable after first 15 min of play duebto wait times.,2
This is not a usefully playable version of the Dungeon Keeper franchise.,1
I loved the classic way back. It was fun balanced and easy to learn. Now we have a lesser version of it weighted down with micro transactions and continuous alarms at night about your minions. Guh,2
"I get F2P and microtransactions as a revenue model. The game does evoke bit of the original Dungeon Keeper Franchise, but man does it fall short as soon as you see something will take HOURS unless of your want to spend some of the in game currency to speed things up. It's just horribly unbalanced and really takes out the ability and desire to want to sit down and ""play"" I can log in, do a few tasks but them i'm all done and out of time unless I want to sink money into the game, and even then it means that once i'm out of virtual currency again i'm all done playing. Let me pay 10-20 dollars for a complete game, heck if its a polished and full 30+hours of play I would pay more. Play by timer\calendar though not gonna happen.",1
This is a souless cash grab by the heartless soul eating demons that infest EA. Please remove this festering boil from the world.,1
"Don't bother with this ""game"". This isn't so much a game as an app to milk customers of their cash. EA is using shady tactics to herd bad reviews off of Google Play as well.",1
I won't even play this game. Read the article on the verge about how they cheat with the rating system.,1
Great gane get this,5
"Level 1-3 awesome, great animation, fun, funny, action packed, but when you need to clear 9 to 16 blocks to create a room and after level 4 blocks go from 30sec to 4hr to 24hr to clear the game becomes tedious! Uninstalling.",2
becuase ea wasnt already hated enough by gamers they put out this piles of dung,1
"This game is nothing but an attempt to turn DK into a farming game to milk all the cash it can from you to by-pass timers. Avoid giving EA any of your money, look elsewhere for fun.",1
"overly priced, moneygrab, can play for a little bit then requires insane money to advance levels. real money. 0 stars",1
"all my stuff has been erased and now I have to start from square one? I was already disappointed in this completely bastardizing the dungeon keeper name but jesus you can't even make it playable? thanks for nothing EA, once again.",1
"The original DK was a great game for its time, and it actually is still so. However this is a hallow version, with prettier graphics, but no gameplay, unless you'd like to invest more than a full console game. Do not be fooled by the *FREE* monicker. It's just not true.",1
"The game is ruined by the terrible ""pay to wait"" model.  After 30min I uninstalled it from my tablet and bought the old DOS version on GOG for $5. Thank you EA for reminding me how good this game use to be. (I am re-addicted to the PC version and suggest you give it a try. Great game!)",1
"The game is nearly unplayable due to the way the IAPs work. Not to mention how much the game just nags you to throw money at it. If you have to pay to even play, just sell it as a full game.",1
EA ruined this game with micro  transactions.  4 and 24 hrs just to chip a rock.  Unless you want to shell out cash of course.,1
"Terrible game using a great name. I think EA is holding back bad reviews and inflating or writing their own 5 stars. Tons of 5 star few 4,3,2 and a bunch of 1 star doesn't seem like a property mix of game was good.",1
They are attempting to game the play store rating system,1
waiting days to chip one block...not fun at all.,1
"It won't go past the connecting step on the title screen anymore on my N5, still loads on my N10 though.",3

It could be fun, potentially, but the only real point is to build up a dungeon in limited space. So I can see very little to keep me coming back. It isn't complex enough or dynamic enough - EA is just back to their old tricks with microtransactions.",1
"The microtransactions and pay to play aspects have completely ruined what I've long considered to be a classic game. If this was new IP, hey, EA can do what they want, but given the lineage of this title, anyone familiar with the original will be disappointed.",1
EA IS THE WORST COMPANY EVER,1
"Hey play this game.  Fun right? How bout you give us money for it, we dont make enough billions. No? Enjoy 4 hours of removing one block.",1
Massive amounts of inapp purchases that are basically required. Inapp feedback only lets you rate if you say you are giving 5 stars. Trash game,1
"This game is a disservice to the original dungeon keeper and its memory.  I wouldn't mind if there was a system to pay to remove ads, or unlock the full game, but paying for currency for temporary benefit is akin to ripping off consumers.  It is becoming a bad habit by EA and they need to know it is not acceptable.",1
,1
Waste of time,1
"Sluggish pace, basically standstill, if you don't sink money into it. Its disgusting, amd EA should be ashamed for making such a money-grubbing game.",1
"DK  is one of the great games if the 90's, but EA have managed to tarnish this legacy with yet another terrible pay-to-win ripoff. The presentation is nice, but does not mask the overt emphasis on forcing micro transactions in the store in order to make the game half-playable. Way to take another classic and stomp on its face EA.",1
"Can be played without micro transactions but it will take time, most certainly a pay to win game",3
"Nothing like the old DK, its a cash grab by EA. Don't even bother.",1
This game looks great and it could be fun. Though the forced to wait or pay to play design of this game is what kills it for me.,1
"lost connection on good network condition. after reinstall cannot login again, stuck at login google play account, keep spinning.",1
I dont want to rate it 5 stars.,1
Pay to win at its worst.  24 hours to mine one spot... Unreal.,1
money grabing and requires a good internet connecton so not so mobile and to accomplish anything it will take a extensive amount of time or money,2
"If you play for free, it's not too bad.  Takes patience if you aren't going to pay for gems.   The only glitch I have had occur on several times is where I build or upgrade something and the imp won't start working.  I then have to cancel the build losing half my resources.  Very annoying but something I believe will be corrected with an update.",3
Embarrassment. Terrible money grab and shameful use of the title legacy.,1
Another example of EA killing off a great franchise with terrible pay to win model.,1
Read the article about EA pushing bad reviews to its own site so I came here to write this one. The game just sucks. It's a cheap ripoff of other games and doesn't even do that well. Stay away from this steaming pile.,1
,1
Crappy freemium game anyways,1
Completely ruined the Dungeon Keeper IP with forced IAPs for progression versus long build times.,1
"Pay to win models seem to be all the rage, and as long as EA gets money from suckers who say ""It's not that bad of a game"" or ""Quit complaining! The game's free to download!"" they'll keep making these kinds of games. The fact that this game has so many 5-star ratings is a testament to the in-game nefarious rating ""nudge"". It urges you to rate the game 5 stars, but if you click the -other- button, which would rate it between 1-4 stars, it prompts you to email EA, rather than send you to the Play store page.  The art style is good, but since -everything- is behind a paywall, and you are playing against other people who have shelled out real money to get ahead, this game deserves zero stars if possible. I can only hope that enough people give this game a 1-star rating so the industry takes notice: this is -not- how to make an app. Even with ""casual"" gamers in mind, this is a hideous app and should be pulled from the Play store.",1
But I was quickly proved wrong. It's wonderful mechanics saved me a lot of time when I was trying to select a building to upgrade but the cursor knew I was really trying to mine out a wall so then my imps began mining for 24hours so I could get on with my outside life. This game really is a timesaver because it doesn't deserve to played and it wants you to know that. I'm so glad that pay-to-win generation is over. I'm so ready for the next generation of gaming: pay-to-play.,1
Don't waste your time with this game. They have ruined dungeon keepers name by making is a pay to win game.,1
"So in order to get any kind of progress, I have to buy gems. To fight other keepers I have to spend gems. To get more minions I have to have 800 gems. You can't dig and find enough to buy another minion in a day's worth of killing time. This is a money pit of a game.",1
EA is using questionable tactics to trick users into leaving 5-star reviews. Also the game is just not fun if you don't pay an absurd amount of money on microtransactions and can only be played with an active internet connection.,1
Godawful in app purchases. Ruins a classic game!,1
I can't even get to my dungeon without the app crashing. Please fix.,1
Purchase the EA Review Starter Pack for additional stars!,1
,1
"I was already turned off in by the  app purchase design of other EA titles, but the in app purchase feature is abused to the point of extortion in this game.  Not only that, when EA asks you(in the app) to rate the game you can only rate it 5 stars in GPlay, anything less brings an email form to the developer???  FAIL!  I don't think that I will be getting any more EA products...",2
"Watered down version of a great franchise, freemium in app purchases are too expensive",1
Ruined a great game by slowing it way down and adding gratuitous micro transactions.,1
Okay game play spoiled by super aggressive begging.,1
,1
Good job EA in ruining a great game that needed a PC revamp not this pay to play BS mobile garbage.,1
"With the current in-app purchasing structure, it could take you a year of having workers clearing blocks to finish just hollowing out the dungeon, unless you pay lots of money to ea to rush the work.  The game gets the 2 stars for what it used to be and has the potential to be again",2
EA sucks. Worst game ever.,1
"I'd be happy to pay for a game that is fun.  This game is unfortunately completely terrible when played for free.  I refuse to support EA with in-game transaction money, so the game is virtually unplayable.  Don't waste your time.  I wish I could give 0 stars, 1 star is more than this game deserves.",1
Nothing but micro transactions and a very dishonest and manipulative way of keeping bad reviews from the play store. Do not download and please bring all bad reviews to the store.,1
,1
"None of my Imps are currently working, and yet when I try to tap on a job for them to do, it scrawls across the screen ""All Imps Are Busy."" I've tried closing the app and reopening it, but to no avail.",2
"Just for attempting to manipulate the ratings system I have given this app a 1 star rating. Come on EA, make better games if you want better ratings.",1
Its ea games...you know that by downloading this you will be nickel and dime'd by them,1
,1
Pretty bad game overall.,1
Like so many other games now a days.....they make it so the only real way you can get anything done is to purchase in game. I'd rather pay up front than feel like the developer is trying to mug me from behind. Only two imps is a pain in the butt without buying more.,3
"I have rated this 1 star, for additional stars please pay 4.99 each",1
This is barely a game without paying for in App purchases.,1
"Concept isn't to far off from many other games but had potential to be better. Some things that need fixed -sometimes graphics, though good, switch from actual figures to just face symbols of them -costs of upgrades jump up to quick! Cannon to lvl 2 is 8k, lvl 3 costs 91k??!! Wtf -takes way to long to finish a task without costing a ton of gems.  -gems can be had for free, but takes forever to save up any amount. Forcing you to shell out cash  -sometimes cave in works, some times doesn't",2
,1
"Besides the ridiculous pay to win system in this game, EA tries to trick people into not giving the game bad reviews. Shame on EA",1
Uninstalled. Please just let me buy the game for $5 and play without constant pressure to spend money.,1
This game is one big micro transaction store. If you want to do anything in the game you either have to pay money or wait for at least a day! It is a disgrace to the Dungeon Keeper series.,1
Terrible,1
,1
"I'm not sure who this is marketed to, it's not fans of the original game that's for sure. Generally, the grinding is immediate and worsening. Other than that it's ok, I guess.",2
Screw you EA! Forced 5 Star Rating?!?,1
"The game charges *ludicrous* amounts to accelerate from ""motionless"" to ""playable like a normal game"", and the in-game rating system deliberately derails reviews of less than four stars away from Play Market so they don't surface here.  Shockingly bad.",1
Should have just ported the originals.,1
"Not only is EA scamming everyone with this free game non sense, they took it to a while new level!  $70 buys you roughly 58 blocks to dig! Are you kidding me! People DO NOT DL THIS GAME! It's free until you realize your waiting 24 hours to just play the game as games should be played. If you want to speed that up you need to spend HUNDREDS!   ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU DECIDE TO RATE THE GAME ANYTHING LESS THEN 5 STARS YOUR TAKEN TO AN EA FORM THAT DOESN'T GET POSTED ON GOOGLE PLAY! Google ban this game today!!!",1
"EA loses its head with greed, almost impossible to play without buying germs and lots of them.  Don't be fooled by the high ratings, EA has gamed them using a gimmick that drives low reviews away from the Play store",1
"nexus 7 just has the flickering EA/Mythic splash screen and won't progress further. Trying to move all my gaming to the tab, so this one won't make the cut.",1
This game is a cash grab from EA nothing like the other DK games. Save your money and time and download the old dungeon keeper games on your pc. Dont enable this greedy company by getting this,1
In app purchases ruined this! What the hell???,1
Not worth your time. Annoying and what I would call a scam,1
,1
EA's new free-to-wait system is stupid and not what gaming is supposed to be.,1
Lol,1
,1
"I can't believe how ea has ruined this beloved franchise, I wouldn't waste my time with this crap, just read more of the horrible reviews and the same reasons why it's crap will show over and over again, wish I could give it no stars",1
,1
This game prevents any reasonable way of advancement unless you cough up alot of cash.,1
I can't name my dungeon. And the game didn't continue from there. It is also a major battery killer.,1
Michael Bay would be proud.,1
Did not get passed the tutorials because the demon that was guiding me through it was incredibly annoying.  Game play seemed like it was get real boring and real repetitive real fast.,1
Go play Clash of Clans,1
How is this even considered a decent game? It's just a money making troll disguised as a bad game.,1
For $4.99 you can buy an additional star towards the games review EA,1
"4 hours to mine one block of gems led me to uninstall the game. I love DKII, I think I will just stick with that.",1
Shame on ea for forcing a 5 star rating.,1
Pretty terrible exploitation of a well loved and classic game.  One of the worst examples I've seen ever of a pay-to-play gaming model.,1
"I've tried a lot of terrible games, but this one takes the cake (and pooped on it too for good measure). Not even slightly fun and extremely scummy business practices.",1
In app purchases are a ripoff. Wait forever to do anything otherwise. Don't bother. Why can't they just charge me $10 up front and let me play the effin game? Greedy bastids.,2
Goes beyond my tolerance for freemium. Just a dull piece of crap.,1
,1
"Frustrating that progress is severely hampered and slowed down if you are unwilling to shell out money for gems to get more workers. In theory this would be fun, but it would be more fun if it was a single purchase for a whole game, not a monetized grind as it is.",3
/\,1
,1
Just no words on what ea did to this franchise...,1
"Worst game ever ! The micro transactions are just a crime ! I mean I get micro transactions in the context of most games like these but this is just blatantly stealing and ripping people off. 24 hrs to mine a block ?! Wow, do yourself a favour and let this stupid game pass by.",1
Garbage game and EA has been caught making fake reviews for this game.,1
Because ea that's the only reason I installed this to give it 1 star now I'm uninstalling it,1
It will nickle and dime you to death. Ea will raid your pockets.,1
The idea spending money just to progress a little further is a cheap blow. I would gladly pay for a full copy of the game.,1
"Cause for some inconceivable reason, when it bugs out and has to reconnect, it trys to make me start over! Have to reopen it everytime, very annoying bug, fix it!",3
"What a terrible game!  Just a money sucker and it takes too long.  Just get the old version, yeah the graphics are worse but at least its fun to play.",1
The Wells dry EA no more $ for u.,1
Mirco transaction oriented..  Very long wait times otherwise :/,2
"I should have read the comments before purchashing.  They give you a lot to start off with, but once your out the joy ride is over.  EA keeps on saying things like they are all about customers, but with the few bad releases of paid games and obvious nickel and dime apps I wonder if they will get another golden poo award.",1
This game constantly asks for money simply to keep playing.,1
Another money grab from EA.,1
"EA is doing its best to prevent people from rating this game fairly, avoid it at all costs.",1
"This is *not* the DK you remember, only a cash grab by EA that preys on your nostalgia. Which is a shame because the game looks great, for the 5 minutes a day you can play it before the micropayements to EA are necessary.  If at every turn EA hadn't been reaching for my wallet I would have jumped at the opportunity to pay a flat fee for the campaign. I might have even been tempted if multiplayer required micropayments to enable me to show off my dungeon and to raid other people's. But I guess enough people are attracted to the pay-to-win experience that EA doesn't have to care about making the game actually fun.  I don't usually take the time to rate every game, but the fact that in-game EA stoops so low as to attempt to misdirect anyone trying to give them less than 5 stars compelled me to give them the score they deserve for this steaming pile of imp dung. What a missed opportunity.",1
"Comparing this to the one put out by Bullfrog makes it seem like a joke. Knowing this is designed for a differant platform makes a big differance in my review. I only give three stars because of the gameplay changes. Charge a one time fee, get rid of the in game transactions, and it will be a massive step in improving what is already a fairly decent game. The added transactions take too much away from the game itself. Better yet, put a new version out for pc.",3
Awful,1
Shameless cash grab,1
....,1
,1
Don't bother. Tons of in-app purchases. You can't play more than half an hour without shelling out more money or waiting a day. Stay as far away as you can.,1
"Besides the filtering of any less than 5 stars because ""five stars will help get new content"" hostage scheme the game isn't even pay to win it's pay to win",1
"Revised Review. As a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, this version of the game had me excited to try it. Unfortunately all of the freedom and fun of the original has been replaced by time restrictions and microtransactions. 24 hours to mine one square, or you can rush it for about $2.50. Ridiculous! If you are a fan of the original,  skip this version,  or you memories will be tainted.",1
Great game but terrible ploy from EA to get your money. I will not support this company any more.,1
,1
"Please fix, will upgrade rating.",5
"Instead of making remake EA has been made cash-sucking machine. Well done, EA.",1
Great example of why in app purchases need to die. EA has ruined my childhood memory.,1
Sad to see this IP get abused.,1
Terrible freemium model with atrocious waits to force payments. And they try to steer any review below 5 stars to their own site so they don't show up on Google Play. Screw you EA!,1
"I came hear because Dungeon Keeper is a good game. I do not like this one. I feel very confined and limited. Connection also is an issue. On top of that, sometimes I start the game as a new play (a restart restores my progress).",2
,1
"The game itself feels rather bland and lacks a lot of personality. Getting asked to spend the real money resource constantly knocks a lot of points off, especially when they don't really add to the game (speeding things up that take hours for cash is a rather nefarious business model). A very disappointing use of a legendary IP.",1
Ingame rating only works if you rate a five.  EA is manipulating the system.  Rate from within Google play.  Horrible pay to play structure.  The original was such a good game. EA needs to be kicked off Google Play for ratings manipulation.,1
"EA hit a new low with this one. Their misdeeds include manipulation of the player, an unethical pricing model, and an invasion of privacy. An impressive total. This game shows just how malicious a pay-as-you-play game can be.",1
,5
boring,1
"So bad, OMG DAE HATE EA????",1
"Load up the game today and all my progress is gone.  Ea, good job",1
Very well thought out and entertaining!,5
This game is unspeakable.,1
,1
Errors and issues.  Made me start all over but I didn't feel like losing another.  Uninstalling,2
No.,1
Had to take out a loan to get past the third level,1
This is the worst kind of F2P game. DK game mechanics are ruined by the lengthy times to do anything unless you want to keep wasting money. Every screen is filled with buy buttons. What a way to ruin a great IP...,1
This is a shameful ripoff of an old classic and the pay scheme is a despicable money grab. Do not install this and definitely do not pay them for this garbage.,1
Boring. Terrible art and music. Plus Freemium is a scam.,1
"As a fan and owner if the original games, this version is an insult. You never truly feel like you're building your dungeon up, moreso due to the fact you have to shell out tons off cash to get anything done quickly. Otherwise you have to wait hours for that one room to get built or upgraded.There was even a recent article in Complex where Peter Molyneux called this remake ridiculous. So, unless you're rich or just have an addiction to throwing money away on crappy mobile games, don't bother with this one.",1
"The theme sounded compelling and the graphics looked good, but I just couldn't get into the actual gameplay. The humor was not for me. The first thing they have you do in the game is slap one of your minions across the face and then kill some chickens for no reason. Just very dumb and terrible.",1
Especially the rating system to push you to not give it a low ratting. Oops. Didn't work here.,1
"Another fine example of holding players back unless they constantly give you money. Would take hundreds of dollars to get going. The potential of dungeon keeper, destroyed by timers. 24 hours to dig 1 block, that is unless you give them more money then that 1 block is insta finished. Next block, 24 more hours or... Money.....",1
,1
"Never mind the fact they attempt to not let you score this game badly, the in your face pay or suck is insulting to customers.",1
This 'game' is so full of pay walls it is no longer a game but a app to donate to EA. This is a disgrace to the dungeon keeper franchise and I highly recommend everyone goes and buys the real game from GoG,1
Pay to play. U will learn that 20 minutes in,1
How could you mess up dungeon keeper this badly?,1
Costs money to do anything.,1
"It's not a horrible game, in fact I would probably very much enjoy this game if it were a full purchase game and actually complete. I don't care about clans and really anything online, I just want to build my dungeon without waiting days to just clear the room for the space. EA... You have failed us gamers again.",2
,1
Taking forever to do anything with only 2 imps. I'm not buying gems or whatever. Boo on you EA....you greedy SOBs.,1
This is a game only out for your money. Nobody should waste there time on this game.,1
Title says it all. This practice is annoying in the best of times but this is an abomination.,1
The game let you consume all your gems in the tutorial and then opps no more gems go pay for it. Scrums,1
As said by many this game is garbage with micro transactions around every corner. Can't get to the next stage without paying. Garbage game for a garbage company. If you rae this more then 1 star you are retarded.,1
EA really made this so it's really more about trying to get you to buy more resources than playing the game. Without buying gems even setting up your initial dungeon takes weeks or months. Buggy too. It says I have imps available but they're all working. Not much like the original which I loved..,1
Cant get passed the name your dougeon screen as well keyboard wouldn't come up. .......after restarting app it worked,4
This takes EA's greed to a new low. Save your weeks of time and get something more enjoyable to play.,1
A huge ripoff and an awful experience,1
I'd gladly pay $$$ for an excellent DK3. instead it's a crappy freemium game.,1
"The game is fun at first, until you have to start digging through some of the harder blocks, if you have lots of patience or lots of cash then it may be fun. I can buy a better game for much less money.",2
"Why play this version when you can play the full game for the price of one in-app purchase? You're much better served buying the old PC version and be able to play the game as it was originally designed, and not be gated by time and in-app purchases.",1
,1
The games mechanics are completely broken. Digging tiles is so out of whack its not even funny. The paid component is over priced. Waaaay over priced. Not to mention the fact that you dont have the option to leave less than 5 star reviews from within the app. Slimy tactics from a slimy dev. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time,1
"This game is bad, a pure money grab.  On top of that, they use deceptive marketing practices to try to get you to rate the app 5 stars.  All around a terrible excuse for a game.",1
Make me rate you 5 stars for updates? That's bullshit!,1
Got to level 9 and it crashed. Opened it back up and I was back to the tutorial. Uninstalled.,1
My imps keep quiting their jobs but the jobs stay active and stalled. Only way to fix it is to cancel all jobs and reset the game. Which means I lose hours of progress,1
Good game.. free to play no adds. Want to progress and advance? Want to play more than a few minutes every few hours to few days? Use gems.. that cost a lot of $$$.. if your looking for it to be a nice remake of the old game keep looking. Like most games that could have been great but its just a cash cow.,1
Was really far in and it reset me back to the beginning unistall,2
That's all,1
"Liked pc version so much...   I have money to pay for the game and additions but it's not interesting to pay for everything, you know?!",2
1 day to knock down a square? Wtf,1
Crashes and boring,1
Boring game,1
,1
"I have tried to give this game time to see if they will fix the box, the boring style and the awful sound and navigation issues. Fact of that matter is that it is not worth it to wait.",1
,2
Proves why they are consistently voted worst company in America. They ruin an otherwise cool game by exploiting millions of Americans OCD. I could go on about the corruptness of micro transactions and how they shouldn't be in games. But EA have done it again.,1
Nothing like the original.,2
"I have fond memories of the original Dungeon Keeper games. I have often mused at trying to get them to run again and was excited to see the Android version released. This has been a disappointment. The pay to play aspect is extreme and it requires an internet connection. Neither of these should be, but are. My keeper also went on a campaign mission, was winning, and was booted from the EA server. I lost the resource put into the mission and gained nothing from it. There are some definite bugs.",1
I'm redirected to EA's site and not directly to the play store. Game is a clone of Clash of Clans and freemium based.  Not worth the download and EA is an unscrupulous company that I actively choose no longer to support.,1
"its fun but overall fails because the game is based on waiting for time to pass if you don't fork over real cash for green gems. Very simple fix would be to train Imps just like all the other minions can lvl2, lvl3.. etc... Imps could mine/build faster like in the original. that way more gems can be had and you never need to stop and wait to play. Horribly executed micro transactions model. base it off of buying cool units or different spells..... not gems",1
Beautiful example of EA's scammyness...,1
"Wait, did I say micro? How about gigantic transactions.  They literally ask for $110 for several thousands of gems. Yes, they are allowing their customers to pay $110 in a single transaction to play a game at a decent speed because otherwise you have to wait countless hours. And you know what EA? I downloaded this game solely so I could give you 1 star after I heard about this garbage.",1
Whoever rates this trash above 1 star is lying,1
"A great game completely destroyed by pay to play mechanics. Expect to spend an hour staring at a count down clock for basic things such as giving a unit orders, to then be offered options to speed it up by emptying your wallet. STAY AWAY!",1
Game is bad and worst of all it tries to stop you from rating it below a 5,1
"Poor game designed to swindle gamers out of time and money. Plus, EA's evil review tactics truly make them the worst company in America.",1
Lots and lots and lots a lots of waiting. I would rather pay $10  and actually get to play the game.,1
"As expected, EA got started towards the golden poo early this year.",1
"When it prompts for ratings, if you say you'd give five stars it sends you to the play store. If you say you'd rate it less it give you some weird other site. I call BS, EA.",1
Horney is ashamed that I installed this.  Not happy with the bastartion of a classic.  Everything which made the pc game great isn't in this game.  It reminds me of all those other city games where you need to pay to win. And the redesigning of your dungeon isn't possible.,1
"Could have been a really great game, but the pay to play structure completely ruins the flow of what should be a fun game. Bummer.",1
"You can't enjoy this game without paying an exorbitant amount. If you want to play it with any sort of frequency, you need to spend way more than what the game is worth. Develop a D.K. that allows you to enjoy the game and charge a flat rate and I will gladly pay. Shame on you EA for creating this pitiful mess with a D.K. name.",1
Tricking people to only rate at 5 star.,1
The in game rating system is rigged if you try to rate it bad they send you to EA if you rate it 5 stars it takes you to Google Play just another ploy by the WORST COMPANY IN AMERICA TWICE!,1
Ridiculously expensive to play.  Another EA micro transaction POS.  Defiles the original game .  EA should be ashamed but they're probably not.,1
"Charging people over $70 for uncovering some virtual blocks of land, or suppressing honest reviews in the Google play store- I will personally steer my friends away from your greedy corporate agenda",1
Can speed up this review with 250 gems for only 4.99,1
Ruins,1
This game is a total rip-off. Everything you do takes a really long time unless you pay a lot of money to skip. If you don't pay the money then you risk being attacked and having your goods stolen. There is no way to play this without being online or without letting others attack you.,1
EA can suck my hairy powerchode.,1
"The app is rigged so that if you choose 1 - 4 stars, it drops you too EA site instead of Google Play to rate the app. Worse company in America just got worse.",1
"This is a COMPLETE Crap App you cannot get far unless you pay alot of money, and they have rigged the in game rating system to send you to their site instead of the play store. SCREW EA anyone that gave this game 5 stars has to be a review bot IMHO",1
Pay up if you want to even play this game. I am so disgusted with pay-to-play freemium games. If anyone thinks this is OK you are crazy. Stop paying these companies! There is only one reason for this and it's greed. Shame on you EA!,1
"This game is an in app purchase atrocity, nothing like the original game, and when their little request to rate the app comes up, if you choose anything other than 5 stars you can't... You're redirected to send them feedback and your rating will never see the light of day.",1
EA took the classic strat. dungeon builder and perverted it to their inferior totally revamped garbage version.  Thanks EA for ruining another great game......,1
"Installed 02/05: Sent minions to dig out two squares after the tutorial, and the timer reads three+ hours. No explanation of why it should take so long. I'll let it spend the next 3+ hours doing the digging, and instead play a game I've paid for that will actually let me complete a level without asking for more money each time. Update 02/09: uninstalled. Everything takes either a lot of time, or what feels like a heap of money.",2
,1
Wtf dwnlded live wall paper and poof,1
"Manages to take a fun game and ruin it with free to wait nonsense. If you love going to the dentist or watching Taylor Swift dance, this is the 'game' for you.",1
why not just make it a paid app at $20..,1
Wait or play has become wait or pay and it is unacceptable.  Should offer one time purchase.,1
Was somewhat fun but now my game got erased and I have to sit and wait days to get to the other mines. No thanks I will be deleting this,1
"Lots of potential, great pedigree, wasted by forcing you to pay to do almost anything.  Repeatedly.  Constantly.  Boo.",2
Just bad,1
As most free game it tries to get you to give money and makes you wait if you don't.,1
It's the worst that mobile game have to offer.,1
EA may purchase more stars for this review at a price of $4.99 per star.,1
Rip off nonsense pay or wait crap,1
Once again ea hugely disappoints. I shouldn't be surprised by now. The hijack rating scam was the topper. Give it anything less than a 5 rating and it doesn't go into the play store. I had to enter this rating manually.,1
The game is polished and could be fun but is ruined by the many IAPs and unneeded time sinks.,2
This game is an insult to the original game of Dungeon Keeper. This version has tainted my memories of a game I lost countless hours of playing as a kid.   Oh you want to play this game in a timely manner? Pay $$$ to speed it up with the user of more gems. Ohh you want to have fun playing this game? Well you gonna have to buy some gems...   This is yet another reason why EA has not seen anymore of my money on any platform.. They are just too greedy and fail to make an awesome game. Its too bad the game developers at this company are stifled in making a great game due to bad greed mechanics being crammed into every game...  Game will be uninstall and I will chose to vote by not opening my wallet.,1
The game is crazy expensive. It says free but eventually you'll be putting cold hard cash down to do anything in the game.  It's also incredibly shady when it comes to reviews but what do you expect from EA.  An in game popular comes up if asking to rate. If you do 4 or 5 it has you leave a review. If you do 1-3 stars they want you to email them instead of leaving a Google Play review.,1
,1
No thanks.,1
Forces you into IAP if you want to enjoy the game. Not to mention shoddy in game rating system that only let's 5 star ratings end up here in Play Store.,1
"How many times will this been shoved into our throats.  The game was developed right, it looks good, but many of its features copied from games like clash of clans.",1
"It was fun until everything got deleted, thanks a lot EA",1
Heard you've been living up to your Worst Company in America 2-time-winner award. No 5 stars for you. Customer haters get 1 (0 if I could) star.,1
Your in-game ratings shenanigans is absolutely absurd.  Also very boring game and way too expensive.  Shame on you.,1
Basically clash of clans but in a dungeon. Just the latest pay to win game.,2

I was a huge fan of the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2; when I saw the name I was excited- and then hugely disappointed.  This game retains the characters but completely destroyed the mechanics that made the original fun.  The game centers on collecting micro-payments to buy gems to speed up tasks.  It also requires the Internet be connected to play- which makes it near useless on a WiFi only tablet when traveling. A money grab is the only reason I can consider for this revisit of the SimCity mentality.   EA is more worried about DRM and copy protection than making a game fun and enjoyable.  Maybe EA should stop trying to design games and work on some mediocre business software instead- that has about the same amount of fun that can be found in this butchered 'game' title.,1
"It appears this is just another money making game! Why force slow progress if you don't want to spend the cash?! This makes it not even close to to the original, and defeats the fun! Take heed from the Simpons Tapped Out, which actually allows you to have fun and make reasonable progress without spending the money. Thanks EA for taking the fun out of games! I would have actually spent a couple of bucks to purchase the game, if you could actually play it!",1
Great art direction. Horrible game design. Way too much pay to play going on here.,2
Changed my rating from 5 to 1 after realizing you needed to pay to get anywhere.  I don't mind micro transactions but this is ridiculous and ruins game play.,1
A pitiful cash grab that ruthlessly flaunts that it is trading on nostalgia. EA should learn to feel shame in order to prevent such future Pay Or Wait releases.,1
1 star because of your attempts to direct unfavourable reviews to your dev's instead of the Google Play store.,1
Do not download this game unless you plan on spending a lot of money to recharge your energy. This pay to wait model is offensive to gamers who just want to play a good game. EA's pay to play system had gotten out of hand and gamers need to take a stand against them. Also the shady practice of steering 1-4 start reviews away from the play store should be banned in Google's TOS. I hope Google will do something about this in the future.,1
,1
EA continues to deserve their well earned reputation as the worst company in America.,1
,1
Nothing like the original. Paying to make any progress in a game is stupid. Make it pay or make it free. Don't make it unplayable.,2
This game is just riddled with fees to get anywhere in it,1
Another game ruined by EA greed. IAP's are outrageously priced and you are constantly steered towards it. Looks like EA is steering itself to a three time worst company in America. If negative stars were possible I would give it that.  Also what's with steering people to put reviews on your site for reviews lower than 5? Dirty move by a greedy company. People who buy games like this are actively supporting greed. DONT download people!!!!!,1
,1
"But bad execution. Tried to trick me into leaving a 3 star rating somewhere else, so I downgraded it to one star and came here directly.",1
"Steaming pile of bad, would be a decent game if you could actually do more playing for free, but real play requires spending enough to buy a PS4. Two thumbs down for greedy.",1
Another 'free' game that's ruined by micro-transactions.,1
EA is tricking the rating system.,1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD!   Game is a terrible cash grab from EA! Stay away!!!!!,1
"I realize you're just copying Clash Of Clans, but how did you do such a terrible job? Slow starts, no shield counter (cave-in)... Keep trying EA. Use those billions of dollars to fix your freeware if you want purchases. Good luck DK",1
This is not true dungeon keeper.,1
To assume EA would be able to just throw resources into a dungeon crawler and have it come out anything decent enough to slap it's name brand on is just horribly wrong.   Between giving users the run around on anything less than 5 stars and the fact that this is a copy and slightly modify edition of Clash of Clans you'd think they could do better than some cheap graphics to make you think you're playing a decent game.   Oh and wall breakers you can't defend against? wth?,2
EA what do you expect,1
,1
Quick timeblocks and a shady rating redirect gets you all the way down to one star.,1
,1
The only winning move is not to play.,1
Pay to win garbage,1
,1
Everything costs. Stupid gameplay with no depth.,1
"You should be ashamed, EA. I will never use an EA product again. I'll ensure my family doesn't either. This is not a game, it's a micro transaction hell hole.",1
Stay away at all costs,1
Yeah that's right. It sucks.,1
I grew up playing DK and DK II. Please don't think of this as a good game. Pickup a copy of the real game and I promise you you'll have a blast instead of this pay to win pile.,1
Another pile of a micro transaction game. Thanks for stinking up the play store.,1
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!,1
Bad enough your game is loaded with in app purchases that are ridiculously overpriced but now you haunt us to rate your app and if you only allow 5 star reviews to be allowed directly into the app store ea you suck!,1
,1
"EA's rating prompt in this game is grosely unethical. Once again they demonstrate a complete lack of respect for their clientele. If that's not reason enough to not support this title, the game itself is extremely dull. You just wait for things to get done.",1
I  owned the original PC games and this port is lacking severely not to mention the money you need to spend which I will not spend unless the game was very close to the game play of the original games also the ruse to rate the game popup pick anything but the 5 star button and it want to email them instead of posting a google review,1
Love it,5
"Was fun at first until you realize you need to shell out the dough to complete the most basic of tasks or wait 30 minutes. Also it has been discovered that in-app ratings below 5 stars have not been actually posting here, so take the high average with a very big grain of salt. The pay to play horribly bastardizes the awesome original DK series, this isn't a long turn based game where you wait for your crops to sprout, it's an RTS and P2P cripples it badly.",1
"In App purchases are one thing. I get it. It's a new business model and I am actually fine with it, HOWEVER EA takes this to a new blood sucking level... Moreover their deceitful way of redirecting any reviews of this game that's not a 5 star rating to an outside source not to be reflected on the Google Play Store rating system is duchebaggery...  For all of this? EA... This game gets the  &lt;^&gt;(-_-)&lt;^&gt; Finger",1
"Addictive, but RIDICULOUSLY expensive to play. If you don't, game takes forever to play. Boring!",3
"i owned the original pc games and this port is lacking severely not to mention the mony you need to spend, witch i will not spend unless this game was very close to the game play of the original games.",1
Freemium model go away. EA is the worst at these blatant money grabs.,1
Pay to Wait,1
Its the most agitating thing when your in the middle of your dungeon and it tries to start you off back to square one. No reason at all! Good game just fix this i wanna get back to my dungeon with out starting over. Then ill change to 5,3
Runied by in app purchase. The original is so much better,1
It tries to start a new dungeon every time I want to play and the money grubbing in this game is ridiculous. Poor Bullfrog they wouldn't do this crap.,1
,1
,5
I like free to play games but this is really a pay to play game.,1
The micro transactions in this game are ridiculous. Wait times are ridiculous. Not even close to worth it. Total rip off,1
Seems EA is misusing the rate my app feature.,1
,1
,1
"This isn't even a game. This is ""put money in, watch something happen"". And thanks everyone who actually spent money on this. You're part of the problem & EA will continue to get away with ripping people off.",1
Tired of getting one star reviews? Purchase additional stars for $4.99 each.,1
,1
Not even joking. What the hell?,1
You'd need to have an income greater than the GDP of a small nation to accomplish your goals in this game before the year 2150.,1
"The in-game purchase system is so blatantly rigged to force you into making purchases, it's insulting. This game is certainly NOT free to play. Hell, it's not even pay to play. This ""game"" is just a series of purchases to get you to the next level of things you can buy. Don't bother.",1
"EA is either embodiement of pure, evil greed, or this game is intended as a satire of everything that is wrong with mobile gaming. All the 5-star reviews are either written by idiots, or by EA employees.  Though to be fair, I consider leaving a 5-star review here to be a sufficient condition to be considered an idiot. Unless you're getting paid.  To quote a Verge commenter:  ""I‚Äôll rate this game one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $4.99 each.""",1
"Forces you to pay high fees to accomplish anything in a timely manner, much worse than other freemium games.  Also tries to subvert any poor reviews in game by taking you to an email form, instead of the play store where other people can see. Terrible move.",1
Not like the original at all...,1
,1
"Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2 were great, original games with character and freedom to do what you wanted with your dungeon. This is a ostensibly free, pay-to-win, click farm. You get no choices other than wait or pay. Then if you try to leave a bad review in the app they don't take you to the play store, you get directed to a different site so your review isn't visible to people considering the game. Kinda shady from EA.",1
"Ever. It actually wind let you rate this game unless it's 5 stars. Do yourself a favor and download and of you're in the least displeased, coke back here manually to rate",1
"We have to keep paying money ,so if someone want to play for  free  either must wait  very long time or find other games to play. After all this is EA game so.......",2
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! WORST FREE TO PLAY GAME EVER! Downloaded, wanted lots of access to Google, downloaded updates, didn't work, retried/restarted several times.  Went online and every article stated that this free to play model is essentially unplayable. Online youtube review showed imps digging two tiles and player having to quit until tomorrow. Another EA Vaporware title.",1
No thanks.,1
"They're game directs you to google play if you want to leave a 5 star review, but if you click 1-4 stars it directs you to their website to leave a review.",1
"This is friggin' BS. All these games that require an internet connection post-purchase, and all these games that ""don't-require-in-app-purchases-but-really-do-to-progress-anywhere-in-the-game"". It's NOT FUN. Whatever happened to BUY, INSTALL, PLAY? Y‚Äôknow, not everybody has a 200mb unlimited data connection... Horrible.",1
Ridiculous game model. Typical EA crap.,1
"Game is fun, not as fun as clash of clans, but still fun. Needs work. One, at times when you build with a minion, it glitches and shows like he is working but he ain't. Once the other minion is done he goes over to the glitch work and starts working. It shows one minion not working and other working. But you can't do anything with the glitched minion till the other one is done... Fail?",2
"Microtransaction-ridden, POS.",1
If you hate this game make sure you rate it here and not in- game they're trying to rig this review area,1
Don't let the good reviews fool you.,1
,1
More stars are coming in a year.,1
"Thought it would be more like the PC version, and I would pay for the PC version on android.",1
,1
,1
"I would love to play this game it looks like fun, but every time I go to open the app it goes to connect it just sits there and doesn't do a dang thing. Please help",1
"Typical pay or wait style freemium game. Was fun during the very beginning when you can play it at a normal pace...but after a short while you either have to pay up heavy amounts of real world money, or have the game speed grind to a near halt.",1
"Want to play the game without spending money? Well, you're gonna be waiting a while. Take the reviews here with a grain of salt, as they send users who say they'll give less than 5 stars to a review form and not to the Google play store.",1
"Kind of a dick thing to cheat your ratings, breh.",1
This is a slap in the face to anyone that liked the original Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper games.,1
Doing anything in this game takes hours or days if you don't pay.  They are gaming the system to not get low ratings and redirecting you to email if in app you rate it 1-4 stars.  Don't support this cash grab of a game. EA is turning more and more into zynga. Can only pray for the same outcome.,1
"This game based off of Bullfrogs fantastic series has been used as a fig-leaf to cover a Skinner box.  The purpose of which is to maximize IAP,s.  EA has killed Dungeon Keeper and this is a tragedy of the human race and the sheer greed of the video games industry execs.  Such is life.",1
EA forces bad reviews to their site and not the play store.,1
"This game is not Dungeon Keeper it's a rushed and cheaply made game that ruins a once Great Classic game, their is no freedom to creat a nice Dungeon it's all cookie cutter and the same. If you want to expand your dungeon you have to either spend real money or wait 24hr for one block, it is just a cheeper clash of clans. I played one day and I was disgusted at the push to make you spend real money on a Free 2 Play why would EA ruin one of their great classic games for a quick buck Do Not Play! TOTAL RIP OFF",1
"So EA has a part where it asks you to rate the app in app (as do many apps). But, if you rate it below 5 stars, it routes your rating to the internet and away from the Play Store. But 5 stars ends here..... talk about dirty play EA. 2 times worst company in the US for no reason I'm sure.",1
"The game itself is ok at best.  Unless you are willing to shell out the same cost of a brand new console game this game is not worth the time.  Once again in app purchases are required if you want to get ahead otherwise it will take weeks to get anything accomplished.  I loved what Bullfrog did in the 90's with the Dungeon keeper title, EA on the other hand proves they are money hungry jerk offs that don't care about anything except money.  Don't waste your time or storage space on this garbage.",1
"If you're expecting the dungeon keeper of old, don't bother.  This is a clash of clans type game that list all of the filthy evilness that made the old game so appealing.  Furthermore this game is buggy beyond all get up.  Your imps (builders) won't register as building something and itll show one free but you can't build anything because it's not really free.  Also can't see how long the build / upgrade will take because you can't see what it's upgrading",1
,1
I hate how long it takes for my imps to build a pathway. If you like dk get war for the over world on steam,3
It kind of sucks that imps are so expensive and they dig so slowly. It's not so fun to spend a week digging a tunnel unless I want to spend money to buy gems.,2
,1
A horrible game designed to use customers' limited patience to extract as much money as possible from them. Also attempts to prevent users from giving negative ratings. One of the worst examples of the freemium model on the Play Store.,1
"I don't mind free to play games that allow you to purchase premium currency and pay to speed things up, but the balancing for this game is far too aggressive. Everything costs a mountain of gems, and you earn them at such a snails pace that you might be able to afford that first update in a month or two. I need to get invested FIRST and pay second, but this game wants you to pay in order to keep you invested.   I'm also very unimpressed that the feedback prompt is misleading. Unacceptable and shady.",2
The in app purchases in this game take everything that is wrong with mobile gaming and then multiply it by 100.,1
"Enjoyed a lot on PC. Installed using data plan.tried to play using Wi-Fi at home. Would not connect to server. Disable Wi-Fi and use (costly) data plan, works fine. No way I will do  this.",1
There is a reason EA has been a 2 time champ at being the worst company in America. This is just another vote for a threepeat.,1
After spend 1hr messing around. Uninstall. Game sucks,1
,1
Not as fun as the original and is frustrating to play. This is how you do in app purchases wrong.,1
Games not fun at all unless you feel like pumping hundreds of dollars into it. Which I don't. Also let me rate the game on Google play with anything lower than a five without taking me to your site.,1
This is a horrible spin off of the clans style gameplay. EA is also tricking people in order to get higher ratings on google play. Sounds like the two time worst company of the year to me!,1
"Fun game, but controls can be troublesome sometimes. Took a while to get it to work on my old Xoom. It was blinking and hanging on splash screen, but after reboot and a few force quits, it eventually worked, but at a reduced graphical capacity. Works great on my Droid Maxx.",4
In app purchase junk like all of EA's crap.  Don't waste your time.,1
Bad rating system. Bad game.,1
What a waste,1
,1
Not like original.,1
"Yet another title that feels like minimum effort for the hope of maximum cash.  It feels like they just slapped together a game with so many paywalls that you're actually better off trying to find a copy of the original, and figuring out how to get it running. Now I'm off to find a clone that has a little more heart.",1
In app purchases and ridiculous permissions,1
"ONE star for freemium model! I really hate ""freemium"" games! I had DK2 for my PC & loved it. I may reinstall after playing this. I cannot stand being nickel & dimed to death to actually enjoy a game. I refuse to buy gems! I'd rather pay up front for a game and be done with it!  Edit: Good thing for EA I'm an old school DK2 fan... Bad for me! I paid $49.99 for gems. Grrrrrrr... That will be the Only $ EA gets from me! The level of microtransaction minutia is absolutely ridiculous. Mining rates far too slow!",1
is not cool. Clicking the 1-4 star rating link in-game does not bring you to the Play Store.,1
"Redirecting in game sub 5 star ratings of the app are dishonest, to say nothing of the awful monetization path.12 year old me is disappointed in this ""twisted"" continuation of the beloved series.",1
Good game ruined by greed. Adverts are fine if the game is free but in app micro transactions are ruining the Mobile platform. At least offer a version that can be bought out right with no in app purchases.,1
The only way to really get through this game is to pay. EA is getting ridiculous. I'm done with them,1
"I don't mind micro transactions, but these are way too aggressive.",1
,1
"In-app review system rigs the play store ratings aggregate. When asked if you want to review it, the link for 1-4 stars sends them an email while the link for 5 star reviews brings you here. Dirty, greedy tactics.  Can't get past tutorial. Keeps restarting.",1
Poor design too much waiting unless you want to spend money...,1
So happy to see this game again!!!,5
Would be willing to pay a few bucks up front instead of the microtransactions...if the game were actually worth playing.  There are way better strategy games out there.,1
The entire P2P aspect really drags the game down. Gems cost to much and everything needs gems later in the game. The guild aspect is a good touch through and it makes for a great time waster to those that want to reminisce over old DK days.,3
This is why EA should go bankrupt.,1
And rating that probably violates the Play Store TOS.,1
"Good game turned into a cash grab from EA. Also, they direct non-5 star reviews away from Google Play to their own website's email to stack them in their own favor.",1
"This game is 100% pay to play. Don't let the free tag trick you. The moment you feel like you're beginning to get somewhere you're basically forced to purchase more resources or the game slows down to a grinding halt and becomes unplayable. What's worse is that if you don't want to give the game a 5 star rating, they steer you away from the Google Play store. This is sketchy, even for EA's already-low standards. Like a commenter on The Verge said:  ""I‚Äôll rate this game one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $4.99 each.""",1
"The pay wall in this game hits too fast and too hard. Its nearly unplayable unless you plan on spending large amounts of money on gems that will get spent too fast just trying to get the most basic functions done. Of course you can wait, but having to wait 4 hours for a single block to get mined out sound fun to you? This is a classic example of ""free to play"" becoming ""pay to progress"" by gimping the player so hard that they have no choice but to pay to get anywhere.",1
"Bad game. The comment pop up directs you here if you want to give 5 stars, but only let's you email them if its between 1-4 stars. Deceptive practice.",1
If you want this game go install the original. It takes forever to do anything unless you are willing to pay $$$,1
"Way too much in options, to pay to play.",1
"This isn't even a game, just a giant paywall",1
1 star review for a 1 star game from a 1 star company.,1
EA has built a deceptive rating system into the game to trick users into giving them 5 stars only.,1
This version of the game is a waste of time and money.  Much better on PC. This version has out of control waiting designed to make you part with your money via many in-app purchases.,1
"I was really looking forward to this game. However,  the game play is too slow because of the dependency of gems. It can take 24 hours for one block to be dug. At this rate it would take months or weeks to build a dungeon. I would happily pay 5 or 10 dollars for the game if it had game play just like the original. I am uninstalling it.",1
IP whoring EA style.  I should have known better.  Uninstalling.,1
"EA, the company that makes this is tricking users into leaving only 5 star reviews.",1
was bored for a week trying to do this game without paying. honestly EA what happend you screwed up dead space/mass effect/ and battlefield what the hell happend to you,1
"Only came here to give it an accurate reading for the poor ethics that EA is pulling in the rating system they've programmed into the game, shady as ever. Once again worst company in the business.",1
But its not...,1
,5
The time takes to do anything without paying makes this game unplayable. Calling it free to play is an insult to our intelligence and a disturbing trend in gaming.,1
This isn't worth the 'free' price - it's designed to extract the maximum money possible from players while providing a bare minimum of content/interest/gameplay.  I'm not sure how this was even classified as a 'game' - there are effectively no fun elements to this.  I wish I could give this application 0 stars.,1
"Seriously,  could there be a more obvious attempt at a money grab?",2
Is aiight,2
Please have option to skip tutorial every dev should do this don't force us to sit through EVERY tutorial its just not necessary for everyone!,2
Takes way too long to do anything,1
"The only thing this game has going for it is the name and the graphics. Ridiculous wait times unless you purchase credits to cut them down. Lengthy process to leave negative review from with app yet only one click to leave 5 star rating? Save yourself a ton of money and get the originals on GOG for PC.  Almost all of positive reviews are fake ones, go ahead and check for yourself.",1
"Old PC games were something special, this junk is a pay to play scam.",1
"After in installing, the game hung up and crashed while downloading 8 updates.  I object to a fresh install needing updates.  However, after reading the rest of the reviews, I think I dodged a bullet.  So, thanks for not working.",1
It takes forever to do anything and the game doesn't offer anything new or interesting.  It's not worth installing.,1
"(tl;dr: Too much waiting.) Really nice production values save this game from a one-star rating. I have no problems with the free2play business model, but the designers **really** miscalculated the pay/reward balance in this game. If they cut the waiting times by two-thirds, it might've been a nice diversion for a few days.",2
"I never played the original Dungeon Keepers, but I'd be surprised if they were PvP-centric city-building games like Evony, Clash of Clans, and, apparently EA's newest game bearing the name. The have constantly asks to connect to your Google play account (a problem I've never had, even in games with microstransactions) before even bringing me to the loading screen, only to have me tap a few squares, see the four hour timers, then close it down to go do pretty much anything else on my phone. Poor form.",1
Been waiting for this!,5
free to play/wait model is offputting for someone who played the original dungeon keeper games.,1
"Its not DK, has microtransaktions.",1
"Every action to advance in the gam e faces huge time barriers, limiting interaction to a few minutes then hours of waiting for tasks to complete. Nice to see a dungeon management game, especially an update on a classic, but these time barriers are horrible",2
"Constant drops from connection in when full bars of wifi present, lost two dungeon crawls and all upgrades since...",3
The in game ratings system doesn't let you give lower than a 5 star rating - all others don't get sent to Play Store. This is shameful. Also this is a horrible game relying too heavily on in app purchases.,1
"This type of nickel and diming is what is ruining gaming.  If you have played clash of clans... dungeon keeper is like that, except every single thing you do is a pay gate, even more so.   Sad part is, I would pay $60 for this exact game without the ridiculous pay gate stuff.",1
"This is not a fun game for you. It's about making the game painfully slow so you want to send them money to have fun. Don't perpetuate these types of games. If you do install, please don't forget to rate with one star and send a message to game developers. We don't want these types of games!",1
,1
Was fun to start. Crashes my table...,1
This game is a severe disappointment. To even begin to get into it and want to spend money on the game You will have to spend money. Not worth anyone's time.,1
Calling this game free to play is false advertising.  It is no fun at all unless you pay the in game fees. Un installed it as soon as I realized this.  Shame on you developers.,1
Big waste of time. Get the PC version.,2
Ridiculously long wait times to build or upgrade anything.  Consistently crashes at start up.  Enemy wizards can somehow move into solid walls to attack your structures.  Save yourself some grief and play something else.,1
Didn't work at all.,1
"Please add confirmation for cancelling of something, I just lost 1.5 hrs of work 'O.O",3
"In app purchases are absolutely ridiculous in this ""free to play"" game. Way to ruin one of my and many others, favorite PC games of all time.",1
"Takes about 10 minutes into the game before you have to wait 4 hours or more for something to happen, another cash grab game that makes you pay or only play for 5 minutes a day. The unit ai is SOOOO bad, they walk right past the main objectives on dungeon raids and walk into traps like its their job. Blow a hole in a wall with a spell and they completely ignore the shortcut, choosing instead to run into the cannon trap. 2 star game but I give it 1 because they give free gems for 5 star rating. TL;DR? Pay to win game",1
,2
I should have known this would be garbage without spending a lot of money when I saw it was an EA game.  To do anything in this game past the first few raids a good amount of money needs to spent.  You suck EA.,1
Trouble with connection and continues to disconnect with a code 7. Can't even keep it connected to pass level 1.,1

"This game is great for the kind of game it is. As far as mobile games go, this game is amazing. It's not the game people want it to be. People aren't used to the style of play that mobile games often offer now-a-days, and they think that this is just EA trying to squeeze money out of a game. Wrong, this game is great for the genre of game it is.",5
Its not really a game................that's all.,1
"More of the same freemium style game that charges absurd fees to watch a timer. Like the Simpsons game or Tiny Death Star, its the same model of garbage in another wrapper.",1

"This ""game"" is nothing but deceptive cash grab by EA.",1

"EA used unethical practices when implementing the rating system. 5 stars takes you to the play store to rate the game and anything else goes to an email ""feedback"" black hole. Not to mention this is a clash of clans clone.",1
"Jewstein, EA",1
"Great concept. I'd definitely pay $5 for a full unlocked version. However, the way it's set up, you can't play for more than a few minutes without spending money or waiting.   If you're having a good time and don't want to stop playing that's tough because the game puts unpassable roadblocks in your way that are impossible to get past without spending real money or waiting hours.     It's really a shame. It could have been one of the best mobile games of 2014, but as it is, it's just frustrating.",1
"I installed this game just to rate it 1 star. I feel so sorry for you EA,  but I just can't help it.",1
This takes a classic game title and ruins it by turning it into a time and money dump.,1
Don't bother with this. You need to pay money to get anything done.,1
I saw this and thought it was gonna bnoe a crappy reboot of the PC. game and its not bad I had an awesome wave of nostalgia,5
"EA drags out another one of its cherished franchises from the grave to desecrate its corpse. Surprisingly, instead of making another FPS, they settled on make a Clash of Clans clone for a blatant cash grab. If you want to make any serious progress in the game, you're going to have to throw down money. Otherwise, expect to be waiting weeks and months to do anything. Some in-app purchases are more than buying a full priced console game. EA isn't the first to throw out one of these scammy ""games"", and they won't be the last, but it's just amusing to see them bumbling around playing catch up in terrible mobile gaming trends. I hate mobile gaming, and I hate the whales that keep this practice afloat. *shakes head*",1
Poorly designed game that locks most of the content away unless you pay with real money,1
"Rating hijacking.  In app ratings of 5 Stars post to play store.  Any less, just sends an e-mail to EA.  And what a horrible pay to play game.  You will never get anywhere without paying.",1
Another quality cash grab product from EA.,1
You ruined another series by making it completely a waste of time to play without shelling out fat dosh. &lt;3,1
Terrible pay-to-wait version of a once great IP,1
You lose men even if you win the fight. And you cant move them around in a fight. Digging. Gems takes day or better to do.,1
"They give you a bunch of gems at the beginning that will keep the game moving for a little while. Once they're gone, you're back to the same old waiting game.",3
"Avoid the game unless you're prepared to pay by the minute.   The game play would be great if you didn't have to constantly spend gems to play at school decent pace.   Graphics and sound is fine, but the grind tanks this game. Look elsewhere.",1
"I have nothing against games with IAP or paying to play game but Dungeon Keeper is too extreme. It costs way too much to do anything. You would have to spend multiples of a retail AAA game to get any playability out of this title. Ask yourself, Do I want to spend a couple of hundred dollars to play a weak port of a 15 year old game?",1
Unplayable without spending lots of money,1
"It's a pay to play, freemium game. That means you can play for free, but it will take you a LONG time to where you want to go. You need imps to build and dig, those cost money. I have 500 crystals in game and need 300 more to buy my third imp. I can only guess that the fourth and imps to follow will only go up in cost exponentially.",1
Won't open so I can put my dungeon name also a code 7  keeps popping up and done get access to email someone to tell them about the problem plz fix so I can play,2
If you are looking for free to play look elsewhere.  No entertainment value. You have 2 choices. Spend good money or wait forever. You can't even buy a third imp without spending money.,1
"Another game where waiting hours is the norm, unless you pay...",1
Just a money grab.,1
I like the game so far but it won't let me name my dungeon so therefore I cannot proceed please fix and I will give better rating plus its very slow on loading,3
One star for dishonest practices.,1
My game went all the way back to the beginning what the heck. You guys need to fix this . I like the game but 1 star is all you will get from me until you fix this I aint gonna keep playing from the beginning everyday thats just stupid.,4

"Makes you wait an eternity to do anything AND the ""rate this app"" pop up tries to only direct you to the Google play store if you want to give it 5 stars. No thank you.",1
Putting my 1 star in to help EA game the rating system.,1
,1
"Honestly it is a really fun game.  But as everyone says, the inordinate wait times to do some things is a pretty transparent money grab.   If they had not hobbled the game so bad I would rate 4 or even 5 stars.",3
"This game is imbalanced in too many ways.  Additionally, it charges you way too much for every little thing in the game both in resources and real-life money in cost for ""gems"" to do the good stuff.  Typical EA gaming charging model.  Just a money pit with over-incentivised purchasing.  Lots of other design and gameplay problems too.  Not nearly enough room here to go into even just some of the many problems this game has.",1
"To get the most fun out of the game, you need to invest an ungodly amount of time or a fair sum of cash...",2
Maybe it's because I played the original on the pc and expect to much from a tablet game but this game is impossible to play unless you want to spend tons of real cash for gems. Unless your style of play is to log on every 8 hours and post for 2 minutes. Already uninstalled.,1
You have to literally hundreds of dollars to be able to play this game without spending days just waiting!,1
Nickel and dime you for every in game action? No thanks.,1
Pay to win scam,1
"Bad enough releasing another cash in game. But to ruin a long treasured IP in the process makes it unforgivable.   Here is what you are in for. They give you plenty of starter gems to get your base all set up to about level 3 in a decent amount of time, however after that the game slows to an absolute crawl unless your willing to spend, and I kid you not, hundreds of dollars on gems. If you don't, it will take you weeks, perhaps even months to progress, and this is before they have even patched in any additional content and upgrade levels. Its that simple. Wait an absolutely ridiculous amount of time, or spend the equivalent you would on several new AAA console/PC games.  Unlike in Clash of Clans, PVP is atrocious, and base design is almost pointless.  Lots of stuff is blatantly ripped off from Clash of Clans and similar games (and ruined), and the game bears little similarity to the series previous titles. You would think that a AAA studio like EA would be able to come up with some original ideas, or at least be able to stick to classic source material. You would be wrong though.  I could go on for many more paragraphs, but I am almost at the word limit. Dont get this game",1
"Insanely high cost to progress in the ""game"", unless you don't mind waiting DAYS for actions to complete. In an underhanded attempt to boost its google play rating, they redirect in-app ratings less than five stars to a feedback form and don't actually register your rating.   It's crap like this, EA, that make you the worst company in America. Congrats on the inevitable threepeat.",1
Really poor,1
Never got to play. Just kept saying checking for updates on note 3. But comments about paying to play made me decide it was just wasting space. Deleted.,1
What a surprise EA  tearing down yet another great name of gaming. When will this horror end.,1
A lot of waiting. Kinda fun.,3
haven't been able to open it for four days now.,1
Way to turn a classic into yet another generic mobile pay to win app.   1 star for the voice over though.,2
The greed is absolutely disgusting.,1
"I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but I can't help but be completely disappointed in this game. I didn't expect it to be like the original, and I do like tap games like this, but spending 24 hours to dig one block out? Come on now. It takes forever to accumulate money or stones, all the while you have people constantly attacking you who have either played longer or bought their way to the top. Oh, and Android users who are asked to rate this game while playing can't give less than 5 stars. Not good.",1
"EA now a days is known as the worst company in America..while i believe that to not be true, they are without a doubt the worst ""gaming"" company ever, they keep making shady stuff like this and ruin every great title they get their filthy hands on, this one is now ruined by overly expensive microtransactions and wait time beyond the originals so if you were a long time fan..well EA now screwed you, and they will not let you rate below 5 stars through the app! AVOID.",1
"This isn't even a game, its a waiting line designed to frustrate you into micro transactions",1
,5
Nothing but an EA cash grab. Don't waste your bandwidth,1
This game is designed as a cash grab and is genuinely just not fun.,1
"Avoid at all costs. First ten minutes is promising but it then begs for cash. I'm a big fan of the series but was saddened to see each move requiring days to play *or* pay the equivalent of $2.00 to speed up.  Multiplayer is based off whoever has the deepest pockets to raise their army putting anyone else at a disadvantage  The unethical app forces players to another site if they try to rate below 5 stars, which is why it is rated so highly. I had to rate this from my browser to accurately reflect the game.",1
A classic series ruined by greed and utter disrespect for gamers,1
"Have to start over every time you stop playing, no mater how far you've played before hand! Stupid!",1
Another disappointed dk fan.,1
,1
"I'm putting my 1 star directly in the play store since EA has decided to reroute all less than 5 star in game ratings to their email rather than the store.  I tried to run the game, but without allowing access to my personal information, it crashed. Apparently, they want to talk all my info in return for this game.",1
Takes forever to accomplish anything in this game. This game is the definition of pay2win. Leave it to EA to destroy mobile games as well as console games.,1
"Too bad I couldn't just pay for the game instead of being pestered to ""improve my [free] game experience"" for $0.99 every few minutes. Plus has super loud notifications that can't be turned off",2
Ruined a great classic game :-(,1
,1
As a fan of the old game...this is horrible and expensive.,1
If you accept that you would like to rate this game and you choose anything below a 5 they do not send you here to rate the game!  The rating on this game is being falsely manipulated.   They pay to play in this game is dialed up way to high to be playable without paying.,1
Everything requires gems and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't asking for mass quantities for every little menial task. Waste of time. Would give it no stars if I could.,1
Don't bother.,1
"For shame, EA.",1
"This game is the quest kind of ""free"", and will try to bleed your wallet dry by throwing up road blocks to playing that can only be worked around with money. Add to that the sneaky in-game ""rate this app"" feature that only takes you to the Play Store if you promise to give it 5 stars, and you've got the worst possible offender of in-app-purchase abuse. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1
,5
"The game slows to a crawl as you wait to excavate and build rooms and units.  Super disappointed, I'd rather go back and play the first 2 games on PC than spend more than a few minutes on this ""game"".  So much that you'd have to pay for, makes it not worth the time.",1
go ckuf yourself,1
Do not rate from in game. Any poor (1-4) rating inside game never makes it to the store.  Thank you EA for living up to our expectations.,1
"This game doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a blatant vehicle for micro transactions, you can't even play without them.  Its such a shame because I would pay like 5$ outright for this game without the crippling in-game purchases.....",1
"I had high hopes having played the original Dungeon Keeper long ago. Unfortunately this game only shares a similar theme as the original and not much else. The pace of the game is very slow, and overall, just not fun.",1
"It has been reported on Slashdot that in-game app ratings below 5 stars direct you to an email feedback form, while 5 star ratings are automatically forwarded to the Play Store, skewing actual rating metrics. It's good to see EA is still the worst company in America.",1
"runs poorly, free is unplayable, and the cost to play at even a minimal rate... you'd have bought a new phone by the time you finish the game. In-app, Game eats all reviews below 5 F.U EA!",1
Expect to pay if you want to get somewhere,1
Avoid EA games. Worst company ever.,1
"I loved DK 1 & 2 and was really excited when I saw this on the app store. But it really has none of the spirit of the original. Then you get into the free to play elements, like 4 hrs to mine a block",1
,1
"The game asks if how many stars would you rate it. If you pick anything under five, it tries to email EA. If you pick five, it sends you to review it on Google Play. So you, the person reading these reviews, will see mostly five stars.  I can assure you, most people are rating it far, far, far less. The game is unplayable without dropping hundreds of real dollars on in-game purchases. It's like Farmville after hyperinflation and all you have are Zimbabwean dollars. Really a pity that EA has destroyed yet another popular series. There's a very visible gap between a developer wanting to make a profit - and this raw and rancid greed.  Save time, skip this game.",1
Not only are the add ons too expensive they manipulate the rating system so only 5 star ratings are posted,1
It starts off as a good game but getting anything done after a bit in the game takes hours and days unless you want to pay creating a giant pay wall.,3
This version does have quite a lot of similarities to the original bullfrog dungeon keeper PC games though entirely different game play.  I would have really liked a massive dungeon where the imps have to dig through to other players and choose to ally or battle.  Also the new stone and gold is different.  I would have preferred the imps have to dig gold.  It is still fun and I am reminded of the original dungeon keeper that I liked so much.,4
,1
Pay to win.  Simple.,1
Sales pitch starts in tutorial. Game is unplayable without spending money. Just charge for it outright.,1
"Absolutely the worst freemium balance I've experienced. How about a pay once and let us enjoy the game? Typical interaction with the game is: do two things, then wait four hours (or pay).   I also just found out that if you try to rate the game from inside the game, it will not allow you to rate it below 5 stars? Way to be crooked and greedy EA.",1
"This game (if you can even call it that) has a lot going against it out of the gate. The most prominent of which is the wait times that force you to pay to progress, which turns the game into nothing but a microtransaction-based mess. If there were an altered version available that removed the pay-to-progress aspect, the game would actually be fairly decent, but as it stands, EA should feel horrible for reviving the franchise like this. Spend your money elsewhere; I recommend 'War for the Overworld'.",1
"Defeats premise of previous games in the series. Pay-to-wait is disappointing, and the way the game handles its in-game Google Play ratings request is horrible!",1
"One of the worst games I have ever played.  This publisher has terrible games, would not recommend anything put out by EA!",2
This would have been a lot better if it was more like the original and less like a money making scheme. I wouldn't mind actually paying for this game if it was more like the original PC game.,1
"I accidentally put one of my 2 minnions on a 24 hour task :(  digging.  Once a minnion is on a task you can only pay gems (cash) to finish faster. My teenage boys warned me not to play. ""EA Facebooked it up"" The tutorial made it look like it was going to be really fun,  but the cost of gems to get the task times down and to get more minions is soooooooo expensive. You have to wait for long periods of time if you don't want to shell out a ton of cash.",1
"I feel odd leaving a 3 star rating for a game I enjoy. Maybe I'm just too fond of the original. The time to accrue resources in this game is staggering. I can understand the need to monetize games, but perhaps have something like a one - time purchased gem doublet lot something for those of us who would like to support a game but not fork over a hundred freaking dollars in microtransactions.",3
Won't even load - EA manipulate's reviews,1
It sucks,1
All of the fun has been sucked out of this game by making it just another Farmville.,1
"One issue I have is occasional connect/reconnect issues. Otherwise, is a very good mobile port of the originals. For those who complained, please link us to your superior game that you spent weeks/months developing.. and host, for FREE!",4
"Some free to play games are still playable if you don't spend money. Some need $5 dollars to get you in the game. This one would cost hundreds just to get anywhere. Its your money, spend it on this or lose. Or just don't play at all.",1
,1
"I was expecting something like the original Dungeon Keeper games, but instead found a game that wants me to pay for everything I do.",1
"As a fan of DK, I really wanted to like this game but the long timers ruin what could be a great game.",2
All I get is server error 7.  Haven't even been able to play.,1
JUST NOT GOOD. DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO HAVE ANY FUN.,1
"Free to pay, not play. Get ready to sit for hours unless you're willing to shell out the money. Waiting 24 hours for a simple action is ridiculous. Getting a third minion without paying is impossible. Screw you EA, go back to Call of Doody and leave my childhood alone. F***ING rapists.",4
Great.,5

"This ""game"" completely ruins the original game. It's supposed to be real time strategy, not some clone of a pay-to-win game that plagues the mobile game market.",1
"Electronic Arts is the Starbucks of the game industry. Fact. Over the last two decades they have swallowed the small cool studios, scattered the staff, ruined our favourite franchises, broadening the target audiences, simplifying them so anyone can play and most importantly, making multiplayer the biggest component - which ensures, through add-ons and pay-to-play upgrades, that the money rolls in and that ppl are prevented from enjoying/accessing parts of the game. Greed is killing our pastime, thanks EA.",1
"Don't install, this is absolute garbage!!!!!!",1
"Great potential but severely limited by the ""pay-to-progress"" model. Ditched this as I got tired of waiting up to days at a time just to carve 1 block (free option penalty).",1
Awesome game.,5
,1
"A game that tries to trick you into thinking its good, by making real criticism a pain to put forth. Stay away, and go support an actual dungeon keeper game, like war for the overworld.",1
,1
EA has taken an amazing series and flushed it down the toilet.,1
"With this infantile excuse for a ""game"" out on the market, the only good it has done is to shine a light on the sad pathetic state of EA's stable of pay to play/wait games. I plan to vote one star on each one as I find them. Its no less than they deserve, and I encourage everyone else to do likewise.",1
Check out gog (dot) com for a DRM FREE version of the original game.  5 USD. Much better than this one.,1
"Spent an entire day mining gems, only to get 20. A full 24 hours to get 20 gems, and the rush price was 249 gems?!  I loved this game but I'm not wasting time and money for nothing. Uninstalled.",1
Just no,1
Total garbage just here to take your money.,1
"My opinion all apps suck, they all got the same boring concept shell out a lot of money to play.  This one is no different.  Dk2 was my favorite game ever made, but ea games got the rights to it from bullfrog studio years ago and did not do anything with the franchise until now.  I want to see real games of DK again not some cheeply made app.  Dk3, dk4, dk5, etc.  No more crappy apps please, make a real game again like dungeon keeper 2 was, or sale the rights to another organization so they can continue the awesome making of this old game.  Lol, their cheating the system to it keeps trying to make me pick 5 star rating, I picked 1 rating.  Please sale the rights to a company that will make more real games.",1
"Is a pseudo fun game with the addition of being able to create paths for your enemies.  However, the app itself, will constantly annoy and remind you via notifications and voice commands.  I shouldn't have to have my phone on silent all the time to avoid it.",1
Double bad,1
The game is a money trap.,1
Just not a good game.,1
"Way to ruin the game, dont get this",1
,5
Only playable if you're willing to shell out hundreds of dollars to cut around long timers. NEVER INSTALL THIS!,1
Save your gems to buy more imps. The latest patch seemed to break the timer on imps at work. The current number of  free imps is also wrong.,4
I had just got the gem pack for $20 showed in my account but no gems :(,5
Ea... worst company ever all they want is money,1
,1
,1
Was expensive as time goes on,1
,1
6 days later you'll know why.  And if you're really bothered Google the damage control EA is trying to keep their lack of ethics under the lid.,1
Everything good about dungeon keeper is missing from this game.,1
"It is truly remarkable that ea can continuously be sleazier and sleazier when the bar is already so high, but the pay walls in this game are a testament to ea's dedication to winning worst company in america for a third straight year.",1
Sorry my baby bro got the tablet,5
"Free-to-wait instead of free-to-play. Unless you spend money on gems its just a game of waiting. Its silly,  EA ruined dungeon keeper",1
"Well, this is Clash of Keeper but with shockingly heavy handed 'Fun pain' mechanics that you are hoped to purchase your way around. Honestly folks, wake up. Why are millions of us doing this?",1
"The game has a ridiculous set of microtransactions, making it a very expensive  game that is very cheap. You may like it, until you realize you are throwing money at it just for a basic experience. Pass on it.",1
The subject line says it all. The original game was awesome. I still own the CD of that and the sequel. This is a parody at best of the original game. I woulda kept it if it was more true to the original. EA strikes again. They did it with Sim City too.,2
"Like all the other fans of the series feel, I think EA really missed the target on this one. I would have been willing to pay $5 to play without needing gems, but alas, I will spend that on the original game elsewhere.",2
In app purchases ruin the game,1
"Just another ""free"" game that   limits you from making any progress unless you spend real money on bull crap ""gems"". It's fine if you want to make all the progress you can in the first 20 minutes.",3
Great u just need add a dragon training room where we can pick and raise our own dragon to take into battle,4
No gems equals no play. I use to love this game on the pc and now I get to play like 5 mins a day then it takes a day for the game to finish what you want it to do. If you want to play like the pc get ready to shell out alot of real money to buy the gems every hour.,1
,1
"The game ""could"" be fun, but it is completely pay to play. If you dont, then you spend hours waiting for a single block to be dug out. I never got past the first three missions and was already having four hour wait times.",2
They should have given it a different name. Something along the lines of 'This isn't Dungeon Keeper',1
The free to play model is garbage! EA I am not spending another dollar on you guys all your games and just made to suck the money out of loyal gamers! I would rather have paid a couple dollars and had the game be like the original rather than this crap!,1
"I had this game on my pc years ago. Loved it! This game takes forever to do anything. Upgrade? Wait 6 hours. Dig gems? Wait all day. If you enjoy watching grass grow, you might like this game.",1
Good job.,1
Un-balanced gameplay/pay-4-play ratio.. deleted.,1
,1
"Dungeon keeper is not what it used to be. :(  Every little thing requires a microtransaction.  There isn't really any challenge to this game, everything can be overcome by spending real world money.  What is worse is that the mechanics of the game seem designed to force you into the mode of overcoming challenges by spending real money.  I have no objection to spending money on games, but they broke the gameplay in order to force you to spend as much as possible.  Also note that they are gaming the review system.  In the game in prompts you asking what you would rate the game.  If you hit 5 stars it sends you to the review screen.  If you hit anything else it does not.  So really the overall rating should be much lower.",1
Microtransactions.. SO MANY MICROTRANSACTIONS.,1
don't download. !!!,1
"Sure it's free to download, but you must pay to advance into the game.",1
This game is utterly atrocious. Literally the worst thing I have played on my phone. It may say free but if you actually want to play at a reasonable pace prepare to shell out lots of cash,1
,2
This has been very buggy every time I start the game it jumps me back about an hour of play time. Almost like restarting every time. I was so excited about this game but this does seem to be all about getting you to spend $. I would have rather paid for the game up front than have try and force me to spend on micro transaction!,3
I knew EA would ruin a great game.,2
You would have more fun sticking your member in a meat grinder,1
EA has made a disgusting excuse of a DungeonKeeper title.,1
"I love the game.  I love the concept.  But it doesn't save.  It didn't save during tutorial.  Once I made it through after multiple goes, it saved and I began to build up my dungeon.  Then I got on to check after work and it's GONE! IT'S ALL GONE!  please fix this and give me my data back.  I'm about to just give up on it and not bother.",2
"(1) Pay to play is required for key components.  You will have to drop a good bit of money to really play the game (2) an embarrassment to the original title this game is supposed to emulate (3) gaudy feel, haven't we had enough of farmville graphics? (4) Manipulates user reviews by implying additional free DL's only available to 5/5 reviews & redirects lower reviewers (5) DRM always online (6) privacy settings exploit content of phone... (Wall Street and Congress appear more moral than this business model)",1
"Calling it a ""game"" is fairly generous...",1
"C'mon,  all you hepcats out there,  LET'S PLAY!!!",5
Some shady stuff going on with this game watch out,1
"All this ""game"" does is download updates for 6 hours. As soon as i can, i'll be deleting all this crap.",1
This game takes a classic and beats it with the suck stick. Major ripoff.,1
"Another rubbish game from the recipient of ""The worst company in America 2013"" award.  The only game play involved here is you trying to keep EA's hands out of your pocket.",1
"Game crashes frequently, shady rating practices",1
"EA managed to screw this into such a cash grab.  Biggest disappointment in a long long time, it's not like gamers needed another reason to distrust EA and they gave us one anyways",1
This game forces you to review it 5 stars to play. It is plagued with pay to play walls to the point it is unplayable.,1
,1
Unable to generate a lot of resources needed for upgrades. Constantly need to upgrade heart for any progress which is very expensive on its own. Original PC game is better.,3
EA ruins another beloved IP by shoving it's money milking cow-clicker business model onto Dungeon Keeper.,1
,5
"As a lifelong fan of the incredible Dungeon Keeper series (all two of those marvellous games), I'm deeply upset by the stunningly EA-esque hijacking presented by the nature of the game. In the  tutorial we learn how to use real money to speed the game and enhance our gaming experience. The micro transactions have been made an integral part of the experience. They are not a pleasant option, they are a nauseating necessity.",2
EA ruined The Simpsons and now they've ruined DK.  IAP are the worst thing in all of gaming. Take a hint from Rockstar who know how to port games to mobile.,1
Under no circumstances is this dungeon keeper. This is Clash of Clans recolored. If you liked the real Dungeon Keeper games this will make you hate EA.,1
It would be cool to be able to test the dungeons in your guild,4
Really don't like games where you have to hand over money just for the privilege of not being attacked by people you'll never catch up to because they take all your stuff.,3
"After the tutorial, you get to press about two buttons every 24 hours. How is that fun? Oh, sure, you could spend your kids college fund to actually complete the first level before you retire to Florida. If you like throwing your money away. The original DK is STILL fun to play, why would you try to make a ""port"" that is zero fun. EA should have just made another fruit ninja or something instead of trying to lie and pass this off as a Dungeon Keeper game.",1
I haven't spent a dime and I'm enjoying the temporal diversion of creating a solid defense dungeon.  I don't undetstand why people download free to play apps then complain about microtransactions.  It'd be like downloading Xcom Enemy Unknown and complaing about how you hate turn based strategy games.  The game mechanics for DK on mobile are basically a clone of Clash. I like how the game seems more accessible since the userbase isn't awash with overpowered players so newbies can be competitive.,4
Not what I hoped for.  No way this is a four/five star app.,1
"I'd originally rated this highly, but that's before I read about EA pulling their usual BS. I've never played Clash of Clans, so didn't know this was a cheap clone. The tricks used to get a high rating are also about what I'd come to expect from this garbage company. This is just another example of this company turning my favorite franchises into a poorly made, cheaply-wrapped money-machine. No more chances, EA. I'm done with you.",1
This is a horrible revamp of a game I once loved. Shame on you EA.,1
"kinda lame,pay to play.typical turret.defense",2
"Like many others I'm a huge fan of the original games and thus when I saw this on the app store I just had to get it ASAP. But also like many others I'm simply disappointed and upset at how they mangled the game to maximize their profits without, it seems, care as to how it would effect the experience.  They changed very fundamental aspects of the game and injected the same old ""pay us to speed it up"" junk. So, ok, they want to make some money and that's fine, but they did it in area's that slowed the pace of the game down so much that it can't even be comparable to the original in anyway other than theme.  The pay to speed up type system can work with some games, but it just seriously slows this one down. Then add in all of the other changes they made to the game mechanics itself over the original... I just found it to be a lack luster trip down memory lane.  In the end I would have been very VERY happy to just pay $15 for an updated port of the game for my tablet instead of having them try and rip me off with in-app purchases that are WAY to expensive.",1
Make it so you can move minions around after placing the during a siege would make it so much better,3
"Mechanics work fine, good audio, and some nostalgia factor. However even compared to other free to play games, this game is obviously focused on your wallet first and entertainment second. A pity.",1
"So, I loved the original.    I installed this this morning.  I played for awhile.  It's setup to take *forever* to play out a dungeon; it's hard to get more than two imp workers, and cutting out a block of wall usually takes 10s... but can take upwards of 24h for the harder blocks.  24h.  For one thing to happen.  Ignoring that...  When you're waiting for stuff to happen, you shut off the app.  And it runs in the background.  No worries.  When something you did finishes, your phone dings, and the narrator speaks and tells you what happened.  This woke my wife, so I went to find out how to disable notifications.  And couldn't find it.  Anywhere.  I don't want notified that the game I put down hours ago ""wants my attention"".  The right price for a game that does that isn't free; you have to pay me for that one.    I'd pretty gladly pay $10-20 for a port of the original.  But trying to get me to play by nagging me when I'm doing something else?  That's awful.",2
"In yet another money grabbing attempt EA has mercilessly killed a great game.  You shell out a lot of money to have a semblance of normal gameplay. Or you can repeatedly click on resource chambers to get meager amounts of stone and gold. Any real actions and decisions will take hours or even days to complete.  EA's excuse: ""It is not pay to win. All content is available for free. You will just not get it until you turn 90""",1
"This is NOTHING like the original, and seeing what EA did to this once wonderful franchise is immoral and disgusting. Don't waste your money on this, or your time.",1
"Didn't think it would be as bad as everyone was saying, but yeah, it's bad.",1

"Reminds me off the old dungeon keeper game. Runs smooth. It  could be cheaper. As some others said, there is a lot of waiting. It's definitly not an action game. One of those games you just pop in on for a couple mins and collect your resources then go play something else.",4
"DK is expertly designed to give you as little game as possible in an attempt to part you from your real world currency.  I'd rather spend money up front on a game I can play as much as I want than have a ""free"" game beg me for money every time I want to do anything. Don't waste your time on this garbage.",1
The game is slowed to a crawl so you can pay outrageously to get anything done. You can not do much later in the game free unless you play 24/7 or pay. Sad joke to a great series. RIP,1
Don't support the mobile scamming industry,1
Doesn't do Bullfrog's game justice. Its alright minus the pay to play,2
"Not fun and the demon on the cover photo looks like someone chopped off the end of his chin, or he tripped fell and flattened it.  And why does he need a nose ring like a bull? So he can eat hot dogs easier?",1
"EA took what used to be a really cool game and screwed it all up. Guys, if this is the best you can do, maybe it's best if you just leave this venerable game alone. The game is slow moving, lacking the originality of the original, and is impossible to enjoy without sinking money into it. I would much rather just once up front and be able to enjoy the game than being coerced throughout the game to nickel and dime it. Uninstalled.",1
"This ""Game"" showcases all that is wrong with the gaming industry. Micro transactions, terrible DRM, and up to 24 wait times to complete actions, just awful.",1
A vile cancer designed by hacks who have no integrity.,1
This is only like DK and DK2 in name alone waste of storage space,1
Far slower and worse than other similar town or farm games. Greedy developers. Padded reviews. EA should be ashamed.,1
"Skip this ""game"" if you like to actually play games. The tutorial starts things off soft and then you hit 24+ hour wait times. Clash of Clans in a dungeon setting, terrible ""game""",1
A game that you can't play for 5 minutes consecutively barely qualifies as a game.,1
Yet another game from EA that comes to market that is full of IAP that ruins the game IMO.,1
Love Dungeon Keeper series. In app purchase of 'gems' necessary to play. I would have happily paid up front for full functionality. Especially for multipayer! Take a mulligan EA and release a real game not a coldly calculated cash cow. I see the 4.5 star rating is based on the reviews of beta testers two or more months before the February release. Bad form EA.,1
Not at all fun and expensive to play for a 'free' game,1
Predatory and obtrusive cash shop makes the game unplayable without waiting hours at a time or dropping ridiculous amounts of money to do anything.,1
,3
Get some class and make a game that plays well.,1
Me,5
A terrible cash cow clicker not worth your time. The originals are way WAY better than this garbage. EA... why? To think I paid some money for the gems. This is not a faithful recreation at all. DON'T FALL FOR THE PAY TO WIN TRAP!!,1
"First off, the microtransactions in this game are outrageous. Second I had to restart the game 3 times because my phone locks after a certain amount of down time, like all phones, and the game decided it didn't like that very much. Also note there is a ton of downtime in this game. A lot.",1
Why bother.,1
If you're a big fan of loading screens related to connection drops (over a stable wifi connection) and being kicked from a raid and losing all your hard earned resources and minions then this is the game for you.   The game is fun...if/when it works so I'll give it two stars but the persistent connection requirement means the slightest blip in your connection causes the game to reload...frustrating and time consuming. Makes me go days without even opening the app...I was looking for a Clash of Clans alternative...UNINSTALLED,2
Is it really a game if you can only check in every other day to click on a new timer?,1
Deceptive ratings manipulation and really badly implemented free to play. Can't do anything without microtransactions,1
This game is not worth spending so much money on.  Give it a base price and get rid of micro transactions.,1
Tutorial was okay. Touch interface was finicky. Gameplay seemed okay but without dropping a boatload of money on gems you cant accomplish anything in a reasonable time,1
"Maybe some people enjoy this kind of game, where the supposed fun is held for ransom behind timers or pay walls. But you know who doesn't?  Dungeon keeper fans.   EA needs to sell these old properties if they have no intention of making real games with them, because worst of all, this game is not even fun no matter how much money you are willing to throw away on it.",1
,1
This game is junk. You have to pay a bunch of money to play. I hate EA.,1

"So I thought it would be cool to just let it sit while you mine while I multitask and play on the pc but nope, this game has a feature that sleeps and you back out automatically and these other reviews are right you got to pay to really do anything with this game. Very sad because I been waiting for this port to come on the tablet. VERY BAD and a low blow to the dedicated fans",1
I've played pay-or-wait games that still managed to be fun. This is not one of them.,1
"I didn't think you could actually screw up such a simple, classic game, but EA found a way to do so. None of the mechanics are the same, you have to continually pay for speed ups and it takes days to build a dungeon. I was excited to relive an aspect of my childhood until I actually started playing this crap. I couldn't delete it fast enough.",1
"So happy they brought it back, but I would rather pay 10 or 15 bucks once instead of this crappy payment method.",3
"Insulting to fans of the series, there's barely even a game here.  And they know it's garbage, if you try to rate it anything but 5 stars within the app you're directed to mail your criticisms to them and it doesn't post your review.  If I could give it a 0 stars I would.",1
Another pay to play ripoff version of a good IP. How does this game average 4 1/2 stars? All I see are bad reviews.  What a joke.  Something shady going on.,1
It takes way to long to actually build anything of consequence. Purchesing more Imp is way too expensive. I would rather pay for the game than use micro transactions.,2
Plagued with constantly disconnecting.,1
Just after tutorial the wait time is ridiculous,1
"Amazing game but I keep receiving connection errors, so I havent been able to play as much",2
,1
Love the animation. Slow... Very slow to build or to mine or to do anything really with out paying. I have now been attacked twice while I am still building. The speed out weighs the great graphics. I have no choice to be delete the game. One star cuz you get to abuse the imps!,1
"Don't listen to these whinny ""gamers"". This new generation of kids are little brats who think they are entitled to everything. This game follows the same model as many other mobile games. If you need  time killer you can pick up and play for a few minutes at a time this game fills the void. I haven't paid a dime and I'm having fun with it. This isn't a dungeon keeper sequel its a  dungeon keeper game for mobile devices.",4
Everything is so overpriced and it's very buggy,1
"Very shady practices in this game, but I didn't expect much better from EA",1
Easily worst use of a franchise in recent memory. Also one of the worst micro transactiob schemes ever. Its pay to play let alone pay to win. Free download is a trick to get you to try the game and hook you. This is micro transactions at their worst!,1
The game is fun to play but it will not stop asking for my Google account information even after I told it no.  It actually stops gameplay to ask you then you have to wait about 2 minutes before it can log you back into your dungeon. I wouldn't mind so much if it only happened at the beginning each time I logged in but every 7 to 10 minutes it asks you again and kicks you out of your dungeon. If they're able to fix this that I would definitely give it 5 stars.,2
Do you like to pay to win (and sometimes just to progress)? If you answered yes to the previous question this game is for you!,2
Horrible.,1
,1
,3
I played DK & DK2 until they where no longer supposed  on the systems I was running. So I couldn't wait to try EAs version of DK but when I did I was sorely disappointed.  DK was nothing like this pay to play disaster. It takes over night to receive any reward for work  done forcing payment for anything you wish to do... This game is a fail.,1
Just another pay and wait game.,1
The only thing this game shares with the original is the graphics. Pay to play sucks.,1
Fun for two min not my type of game until I realized I was gonna need to spend money to keep going...,2
They butchered my favorite game.,1
Poo,1
We consumers are willing to pay a fair price for a full enjoyable game and not this crap. Even releasing a port of the older DK's could have been better than this.,1
"Drop internet connection, and it boots you out of the game, losing any progress on the current level. Shame because it seems like a fun game, but I refuse to support user-hostile devs and apps.",1
I can't express how disappointed I am in this game.,1
"Horribly crash prone, locks up and freezes, resource hogging, hunk of trash.. just to mention a few of my gripes.. apparently it is also an attempt to suck money from you in order to skip week long waits.. I wouldn't know first-hand because the game crashes too much to be even remotely playable for me :( ... but, it's EA... why did I expect any better?",1
Even with unlimited gems (in-game purchases) this is still a shell of a game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.,1
There is cool stuff please make updates:-),5
"This game is horrid and another example of the classic ""buy things to get tasks done faster and have actual fun"". A complete insult to the original game on PC, please do not support this trash.",1
"So, a blast from the past this was. But its so heavily dependant on micro transactions that only a person with ten minutes a day, or a person with a thousand dollars to spare can really play it.",3
Pure pay to win.. No real gameplay elements,1
"The free-to-play model can be done right (PvZ2), but the choices made here by the devs make the only sane way to advance either spending all of your money or all of your life.  The dishonest way they encourage you to rate 5 stars or instead provide them feedback is just the fly that breaks the camel's back.",1
"F2P at it's worst. Practically tries to beat you over the head to buy gems, which are necessary to accomplish anything of note. Only sends you to the review page if you click the ""5 Star Review button"". It sends you to an email page otherwise. It's a storefront that they forgot to attach a game to.  The originals were excellent games and I highly recommend them. This is garbage. Avoid.",1
"When your microtransactions get so bad that they've clearly ruined the fundamental fun of the game play of a classic franchise, it's probably time to stop.",1

"Now, if I can get that voice for my GPS directions...",4
This is clash of clans in a dungeon keeper theme.  Check out war for the overworld instead for a spiritual successor of dungeon keeper. Because this is only dungeon keeper in name only.,1
"Just did not like it, also I hate games that tries to get me play all the time by using phone alerts",2
This used to be a great game. How could anyone think this kind of scam is ok?,1
Remembered playing the pc version of this game and enjoying it. My only nitpick is the microtransactions which I avoid just to play. I'll keep playing the pc versions,1
I would buy a full pc version. Don't think I'd spend money on this tho. Just started but the prices seem a bit high...  Played a bit. Pay to wait confirmed. Shame DK has been brought to this.,2
,1
Crazy expensive. They stop the game and make it unplayable until you buy the IAPs,1
They have destroyed just another franchise. And look! I managed to not rate it 5 stars! They go lower and lower every day.,1
EA has once again figured out a way to screw people over on titles most would be willing to pay a one time fee over.  What a joke making it impossible to rate the game lower then 5 stars inside in the app.  Stay away!,1
Wow new low from the company that that I thought coukd fsll no further after Dead Space 3 and Mass Effect 3...,1
If I could rate this zero stars I would. Dont download this game unless you have tons of money.,1
"If you want to spend $20 to buy gems to buy 1 imp, and then watch that imp take 24 hours to break a wall (or you can spend $5 in gems to knock the wall down), then this is the game for you! An abortion of a classic franchise",1
All need to play,5

It sucks.,1
"It gets boring, feels bland and you will lose interest in minutes. Don't waste your time on this.",1
"Does the originals a great injustice. Pay to play, horrible wait/build times, random dungeon resets, always connected is a pain in poor reception areas and even disconnects randomly with WiFi. Just not worth the time, EA ruins yet another game.",1
"Soon (< 1 hour) after you start the game, you have to wait, and wait and wait. By the second day, it's so booring to play because of the waits. Also - EA is blocking all of the reviews less than 5 stars if you review the game during the game. That's outrageous.",1
Bad pay to play model with a rigged rating system that will take you to a survey if you try rate it less than 4 stars.,1
"Lol what a joke of a game. When the game asks you to give a rating, it asks you to rate it between 1-5. If you choose less than 5 it asks for a reason and doesn't let you go to the Google play store but if you give it a 5 it directs you directly to the play store lol.",1
Nothing like dungeon keeper stay away game sucks so bad pay too do any thing,1
,1
I'm so sick of mobile games that make every action take minutes or hours unless you use the special currency that can only consistently be replenished by spending real money. I'd rather spend a couple bucks one time and play a real game. Stop with the cheap free-to-play nickel and diming.,2
^,1
"I want to build a dungeon and play the game, not wait 4 hours or 24 hours to build a room unless I spend real money to speed things up.  Why can't I just play?",1
"Fun at first but quickly turns into a game of spending a lot of money to get gems or wait for hours, even days, to get anywhere.  Yawn...",2
"No thank you. And thanks for the stupid track that  downloaded its self in to my files, even after I clicked NO. Go away Electronic Arts, I don't like you anymore",1
"If you are looking to play straight through the campaign and level up your dungeon quickly it can be expensive, but for those like me that are interested in a more casual experience it is perfectly balanced. I have been playing for about a week now, and have not spent any actual money. Unlike so many other games that follow the ""free to play, in-app purchase"" model, you do not feel crippled by the slower advancement of completely free play. I think the starting gems are quite generous, but I would hold off on spending them to rush initial production until you have played for awhile and better understand where they should be spent. Overall an excellent experience.",4
The original was great.. however in this version you are the minion getting slapped by the ea dungeon keepers as they raid your wallet.  Save your time and money and just skip it.,1
Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
,1
,1
"But the money grab here is out of control.  This isn't pay to win, its pay to play.",1
Its crap. Even if it wasn't pay to win it would still be awful.,1
"EA strikes again! EA never fails to amaze with how easily they can destroy a beloved franchise. If you don't mind waiting hours for everything, or you have vast amounts of disposable income, you may enjoy this game. Otherwise, don't waste your bandwidth. To top it all off, the game tries to force you into rating a 5 just to stop the popups.",1
"Make sure your credit card is on file if you want to play this game; as it's the only way to advance. We all knew that this so called ""free-to-play"" model would eventually be abused to the point of full on wallet rape, and it's no surprise that EA was the first to get there. Way to ruin a classic game!",1
"The in-game voting function only allows 5 star rating or no rating. This is an unfair practice, and I suggest not only rating 1 star through Play store, but also not buying gems or resources with Real Cash until EA removes this 'vote rigging.'",1
,1
One of my favorite games of all time ruined by in app purchases.  I would have rather it be a one time buy than need to buy all these stupid gems. Go to hell EA,1
Ur the reason battlefield is trash and why I won't be buying titanfall.,1
Nothing happens unless you want to pay $100.  Just wait days and days to clear one row,1
"If you liked the original, don't get this. This is an example of everything that is wrong with mobile gaming today. The reviews are also rigged. Metacritic shows a user rating of 0.3.",1
App refuses to allow you to give any rating other than 5 stars.,1
In a new gaming low point EA is now filtering out bad ratings.   The high ratings are a sham.  This isnt even a game as much as a money grab.  You can not play it without spending tons of money.  Shame on you EA!,1
"I wasn't surprised to learn that the game was had micro transactions, but I have never played a game that was so aggressive about them.  I'm really disappointed.",1
"No really it just sucks, I could go into detail but there are plenty of people willing to give you their opinion on youtube.",1
This is not the game you think it is.,1
"The game has little to no game play unless you pay. Yes you can do things without paying but most of the time you just wait for resources. I don't like to be censored either. Only if you vote 5 stars it will appear here, unless you go to the play store directly.",1
Microtransaction hell.,1
This game is a scam.,1
"Takes to long to do anything.  Stopped playing a while ago and decided to give my thoughts on the play store in hopes to bring the rating dien enough to open EAs eyes.  If gladly rate this like the original if it were even emporium similar.  No free build mode long waits, in fact there are waits. ... There shouldn't be. As it stands a disgrace to the original.",1
Like the game but costly unless you have time to waste,1
"This game literally TRAINS you in the tutorial to spend gems to speed up everything (gems are what you spend real money on) , otherwise you often have to wait DAYS before a task can be completed. This is so blatant it almost makes me sick. Just give me one flat fee to pay and get a whole UNRESTRICTED experience. I'm absolutely sick of paywalls in games. Seriously. Sick and tired of abusive ""free""-to-play games.",1
"I loved the pc game and making an app for phones and tablets was a great idea but the entire part that made this game enjoyable was playing it and because of the green gems you don't really get to. I love that it was cartoonized for apps, I love the concept in all except the money. Give the option to purchase the full game without having gems to be used to advance.",3
"In order to do anything you have to shell out cash, which is the standard in most games, but EA to squeeze you for everything you want. Make the gems more abundant in the packs or just Nerf the price",1
This isn't a game its a scam. You have to pay crazy prices for everything. And what's this about them filtering out all the low ratings?,1
Seems promising at first. Game play quickly becomes annoying and tiresome. Nothing like its PC predecessors. Ran poorly on my devices with force closes occurring often.,1
Took 15 minutes to update and sign me into Google plus (not sure why that's necessary) before it would let me play. Uninstalled it before I even played the game.,1
I Guess free games now means pay 10x more than what you would normally pay to enjoy a game. Come on ea just rerelease a paid version for $6.99 without these micro transactions. You'll have better reviews,1
Good tribute to the old   dungeon keeper game,5
Its not a bad game... but the glaring pay 2 win holds it back combined with timer timer timer. If it wasn't a plant cash grab it could be a relatively good mobile game but sadly it's greed over gameplay,2
Ha ha,1
"I have turned all sounds down to zero, yet notifications continue to produce sounds. Don't give me the option if it does absolutely nothing.",1
,1
"In addition to this being the ""gold""-soaked (all-new in-game DK humor preview!) desecration of an IP belonging to one of the first to fall victim to EA's dev hitlist, the game practically holds a gun up to your head in order to get a 5-star review. The reason this has so many glowing ones is because a positive review nets you free gems, and anything less just redirects you to EA's trusted support service, the only way you review as usual is to come back to the Play page. Anyway, that's kinda waaaaaaaaaay against the TOS last time I checked, so, uh, I recommend doing something about it. Another alternative to spending real-word 3D money towards microtransactions is to grab the OG DK/DK2 off of GOG as a form of rebellion, or something, you'll stare in awe as the measurement for mining stone is measured in microseconds instead of days",1
"I can't even get passed the tutorial without it restarting, i play tons of games that require an active Internet connection so what's the problem with this game?",1
"This shoud show 1 star, if i shows any think uthere than 1 than something fishy is going on",1
Terrible Terrible game behind nothing but pay wall,1
"Unplayable without paying, and even if you were willing to pay, the prices are ridiculous",1
Always crashes when I get to the point where I'm asked to name the dungeon. (Nexus 5),1
EA sucks,1
Really is a shame this COULD have been a fantastic game,1
GUYS ONLY 5 STAR RATINGS COUNT GO TO YOUTUBE LOOK UP APLHAOMEGASIN AND WATCH HIS NEWIST VIDEO HE WILL TELL YOU EVERY THING SPREAD THE WORD,1
Consumed by greed EA has demolished a once beloved franchise.,1
"This is what EA was probably thinking: ""derp they have to pay us 100 dollars to actually progress derp derp derp.""",1
"EA ruined the DK license. This game is garbage, and the company is garbage.",1
Lower it and I well rate better,1
I had it for a day and a half and trashed it. Redownloaded it just to give it a 1 star after reading about the controversy. I really wonder who EA paid off to give the 'game' a 4.5 star average.,1
Another game you cant play for long,1
The games tutorial incessantly  pushes you to spend the real money currency as quickly as possible. If you don't it subjects you to brutal wait times. Plus it seams that you need a constant data connection to even play.,1
"This game is nothing but a money grab. If you like paying not to wait, then this is the game for you. It would have been fine if they had charged 5, or even 10  for the game and unlimited play. Instead they decided to try and drain as much money out of people as possible for a mobile game. I was unable to progress in the gameplay after just 5 minutes, and was forced to wait 4 - 24 hours per block, unless I paid. Utterly disappointing and a disgrace to gaming. Thanks EA.",1
God this free to play needs to be changed to free to take your money games!!!,1
Lol EA. Going through your app isn't the only way to rate this cash grab of a game.  Why make a free game that requires you to spend money on it and stop reviews below 5 stars from showing up?  Hopefully Google de-lists your joke of an app designed to only allow 5 star reviews and for lining your pockets. 24 hours to take an action or spend money? Are you kidding me? Speak with your wallets consumers! Do not spend a penny in game and report it to Google for trying to scam the Play Store rating system!,1
"Deceptive in game rating process, indicating anything less than five stars and it won't direct you to the play store",1
"Needs to be balanced more, certain minions are to overpowered and defense are very weak .",3
"I was excited to see DR in the app store, but was sorely disappointed by the game itself. If they had called it anything other than Dungeon Keeper, I would never have given it a second glance. Unfortunately, they took what could have been a great game and turned it into Farmville. After this and PvZ2, I will be having second thoughts about all other EA games. Please, just give us a normal game at a $5-$15 range. I would have paid $10 for a closer to the original complete game than this free crap",1
"The game functions. That's nice. It keeps on trying to link to my G+ account. I don't get why I have to cancel out every time. If I keep push notifications on, I get *constant* messages. I want them on since tasks can take hours and I don't want to wait in-game. If I decide I want to attack, I have to wait a while to summon things or pay $$. If I want to do part of the campaign, I want to do it NOW, not in 15+ min. It'll notify me when summoning is done. No thanks. Busy doing other stuff now. Uninstalled.",1
"Barely a game, the tutorial was drawn out, pushing to spend the premium currency at every turn.   The bad thing is that it takes what could have been a fun dungeon building game and slows it down to a major degree. 4 hours for digging out a wall bit with rock, and lord forbid you ever want a more complicated layout, as it'll take you days on the timer alone in digging.",1
"I had given this game 5 stars, then I played it more. It's very slow paced (something Dungeon Keeper should never be) and it lacks the thrill of gaining control of an underworld empire. The focus on micro transactions is vexing. And a real time strategy game was revived as a slow paced tower defence game. Not really worth spending money on.",1
Enough said,1
1 star due to EA and their 5 star ratings scam.  Go back to Flappy Bird until next months mobile fad trash arrives.,1
In-app purchase requirements make this game unplayable. Ill wait for a third party port of DK.,1
This is a disgrace to the originals,1
"Green is for money. This game has 4 resources. Gold, Stone, Mana, and of course - gems. Or a better way of saying it, your wallet. Prepare to wait weeks to get anywhere or pay out the wazoo to accomplish anything. EA ruins yet another great IP for a quick buck.",1
Have to be connected all he time to the internet. Link your Google account to there system. Not worth playing; especially if you don't plan to send at least 20 USD. You can get dungeon keeper 2 on GOG for 5 USD.,1
"Can't we go back to how PC games are? Not a give us your money or wait for eternity. But, pay a modest price this one time and you can play all you want. Micro transactions are needy and greedy. If you pay real hard earned cash on a game stamped ""free to play"" you are a sap. This is a message not to the money grubbing suits at EA headquarters. But to my fellow friends who enjoy gaming, and not having to empty their wallets all day for some ""in-game currency"" make an honest decision. Don't pay for junk.",1
"Being attacked 2-3 times every 24 hours is a huge turn iff to the game. Even if you spend some real money you wont get much for it.   If the point is to build you dungee, well it takes forever to get anywhere. I Eg. 2.4 million for my next hear upgrade and because of attacks I get an average of 100k a day. Thats over 20 days spending all my resources for something which makes a minimal difference.   Im soo done with dk.",1
What. Did they do. To dungeon keeper?   These are dark days friends.,1
Takes too long or costs too much to do anything...,1
This has gotten ridiculous. You can barely do anything without paying. Might as well have massed this a game you had to pay for instead of these abhorrent micro transactions. This have is definitely not free-to-play.,1

"Trying to trick people into giving your micro-transaction ridden mess of a game a perfect score by trying to silence those who would give it anything less than 5 stars. That's low...

Please stop ruining the video game industry,1
The fact that it takes 24 hours to clear some blocks without paying to speed it up is nonsense.  The original version of this game was infinitely better.  EA Has ruined this game,1
"Whenever I see a title that EA got a hold of, I keep my funeral clothes ready. This did not disappoint in that regard.

It's a cloaked figure badly imitating an old friend, beckoning you into a tar-black alley. Under the shroud is greed incarnate, grinning.""",1
$60 for to get rid of 50 blocks gg no re ea,1
"Lacking in multiple areas, needs improvement",1

"Recently ea's current console and pc releases have been rushed and horrible, bf4 perfect example. Anyways I'm boycotting ea games to prevent grief for future gamers.",1
I don't like that reviews from your app don't count unless they are five stars. Not a fan of f2p games where you do one thing and then have  to wait hours or days to do something. Shady practices and bad signs of what to expect from your future titles.,1
Screw u microtransactions,1
Nothing but a money pit.,1
"Eat me, phaggot.",1
can't do anything without paying money.  tries to trick you into giving it 5 stars.  don't believe the good reviews.,1
"Restarted app and phone, uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and tried wifi and 4g. My phone is a galacy s4. Nothing works.",1
Will update rating once it actually installs  Update:  finally installed. Fun game but requires patience.  Won't work on my nook color with cyanomod 10.2.1.,3
"This is just the same game format as all the other online microtransaction games (e.g. Evony, Command and Conquer Tiberium Alliances).  They just stick a different skin on it.",1
Stop with all the micro transactions.,1
Cool,5
,1
"Just trying to save your some time with this. Just don't download, just don't.",1
Spend a whole bunch time working on my world. The next time I loaded the game all of my work was deleted and I had to start from scratch.,1
The revitalization of a wonderful classic in free to play form isn't really that bad. What gets me is the blatant attempt at forcing us to spend money to try and enjoy this recreation in its entirety. Squandered by absurd wait times and even EA's sneaky attempts at funneling reviews just makes me sad to see a beauty like Dungeon Keeper be at the mercy of the beast that is Electronic Arts,1
classic dk,4
Not fun at all. Everything takes forever.,1
"If you haven't downloaded this game, don't. If you already have, stop playing. It's nigh impossible to rate this game below 5 stars and the amount of money you'll spend is absurd. EA is just begging to get overrun by Activision and Ubisoft with the litany of DLC and server issues they have. 0/10 would never play again.",1
"Just starting and finished the tutorial. Looked like it could be fun. Now, 4 hours to clear one square? That has to be a mistake... if not that's just terrible. EA, you're better than this.",1
"The troops build fast, so lots of raiding. But 4+ hours to dig a block is a game killer since it pauses the fun out of making a dungeon for months.",1
Gross abuse of the pay to play model.,1
The whole game is designed around the in-app purchases. It isn't even slightly fun or interesting. Do not waste you time and bandwidth on Dungeon Keeper.,1
Kool I love dragons,5
"Great concept, but goes bad fast with the micro transactions. Ruins the game. Shame.",1
Or wait a day to clear one  block. Screw this game.,1
To get anything done in this game costs a stupid amount of money. EA is doing everything they can to CENSOR negative reviews about this game by directing users who try to rate it anything under 5 stars to an internal response form. I wish I could give this game negative stars. I loved Dungeon Keeper 1 and Dungeon Keeper 2. EA has taken Bullfrog's masterpiece and replaced anything good with a big hole waiting to be filled by your wallet. The full original game is available for PC and Mac for $6 from Good Old Games. No micro-transactions needed.,1
This isn't a game it's just an excuse for EA to milk your money from you.,1
"Takes too long to do anything, ties up both of your starter minions and expects you to pay ridiculous amounts of gems to get anything done. (I especially like the 'pay 256 gems to get 10')",1
Game is mediocre and a blatantly wallet emptier that spends half the tutorial making you spend crystals. This being mostly par for the course I would usually rate at two or three stars. BUT YOU CAN'T rate it less than 5 stars through the game rate popup that keeps showing because selecting 1-4 stars doesn't link to play store but to direct feedback that is not reflected in play store. Because of this 2-3 stars becomes 1. But really what can you expect from EA.,1
,1
,1
For those to young or too dumb to know this game came out on PC a long time ago so it's not a clash of Clans copy it used to be one of my favorite games for PC glad to be able to play it again,5
"This is the worst implementation of the free to play model I've ever seen, and it's made worse by the fact that they delivered this game under the guise of a long revered franchise. Literally seconds after the tutorial ends you will find out it takes hours to carve a single block of gamespace, making it clear that paying exorbitant amounts for the in-game currency will be necessary to experience this ""game"" at any kind of reasonable pace.  Stay away from this one",1
In app purchase ridden game. Installed just to rate poorly.,1
This is a bad port to the mobile space. I highly recommend avoiding this game. The game play has been deliberately slowed down to allow for micro-transactions to make sense within the game. It just makes me sad that EA or the the developer decided to make these design decisions. As I said earlier avoid this game. Show EA that this game is terrible by not downloading it and not giving them your money.,1
Don't be fooled by high rating of this game - EA managed to hide most reviews that give this game below 5 starts. Leave it up EA to destroy yet another beloved franchise. This is nothing but a horrible timer-fest with real money transactions. Stay away from this crap.,1
,1
It was fun but very soon ended up the same way Clash of Clans did. Too long to upgrade anything. In less than a week I'm waiting for days on upgrades. Clash took much longer to start taking so long. Don't install unless you got patience for days,3
Unplayable without spending tons of cash.,1
Why do I always have to lose my deployed minions even though they didn't die and I won. Because EA is a bunch of greedy a-holes.,2
A great translation from the original PC version to a casual portable.  However the wait times and resources required to progress are absurd to the point you interact with the game MAYBE once a day after only a few days of playing.  Get real EA!,2
Pay to play,1
"As a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, I'm insulted by this ""game."" Disgusted by the whole free to play microtransaction pay model. Total rip off. Waiting hours to dig a block or pay real money. EA is fast on it's way to being voted the worst company in America for a 3rd year in a row. BS like this game is exactly why.",1
It will take less time to download than it will to knock down a wall in this game...,1
,1
A payalled insult to a great series.,1
"I didn't even make it past the tutorial when I realized if you don't pay money to play, you will be playing very little",1
Don't even bother downloading in its current state.  Unplayable without spending large amounts of money,1
"Underdeveloped, decent graphics but takes to long to do anything. Game still Too new to play. My advice just wait on it.",1
,1
"The game just constantly gives me error messages about being unable to connect.  A non-working game deserves 0 stars. Alas, I'm forced to give you one.",1
"Don't even bother.  Your choices are wait 4 hours to dig one square, or pay.  When rooms are 4x4 and you have 2 imps, wait a full day if you check in every four hours before you can build.  Oh and you can't queue up actions without an imp.  But luckily you can spend 7 dollars or so for one.",1
Doesn't even let you give it a low rating,1
,3
Very hard to do anything without paying for it.,1
Can't just buy the game. It has gems. Waste of time,1
Change me $5 to buy the game and take away the pay to get anything done,1
"The constant notifications are annoying, the game takes forever to do anything and they are trying to make money off of a good name.   Don't download this app.",1
,1
,1
,1
"I liked it at first but as I played more it started to bore me.  It's just another Clash of Clans.  Raid, get a new army, build something & wait, collect your supplies, build again wait LONGER.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Sure you can buy jewels to rush and I understand that's how the developers make their  money but that can get expensive and it's that or wait 24 hours to dig one square. I'll keep for now but it is getting dull fast.",3
Where are the 26000+ positive reviews that give this game a 4.3 out of 5? The reviews on gaming websites and here are overwhelmingly bad. This game is too expensive. Someone also needs to investigate the ratings for this title.,1
"Essentially a pay-to-play cash-in on a venerable series of strategy games, this is nothing but milking nearly two decades of good will for a shoddy product.  That EA makes it harder to rate it lower when the game begs you for a rating is despicable.  Skip this.",1
"Full of brick walls forcing you to either spend money or wait for ridiculous amounts of time, the original was great, this one not so much. Go look it up, I don't want to waste any more time with this game or EA.",1
Way to many in app purchases. Go buy dungeon keeper for PC on gog.,1
Way to much money on the add ons and takes for ever when you don't pay,1
Terrible game. Shallow and pay to win. If you want to play for free you will literally wait days or weeks to do anything. Nowhere near as good as the original.,1
"After a few days' play, I find this much like other players. It is a clone of Clash of Clans, or Castle Clash, or Dragons of Atlantis, but in no way comparable to its namesake. Though I admit it made me reinstall DKII for some real evil play...",3
And was appalled to find hire incredibly expensive everything was. What i find funny thigh is how there are 24000+ 5 star reviews for it but somehow all the reviews i read are how it sucks.,1
Ultimate example of everything wrong with the free to play model. Have fun forking over cash constantly to play at all.,1
We should not allow games that exploit excellent names thrive in this industry. EA has made a mockery of the Dungeon Keeper franchise and I'm not the only one who thinks that. The sheer requirement of microtransactions is sickening.,1
Time is too long to be able to play,1
I wish I could give this game zero stars.,1
,1
EA claims they built the game for mobile where you just play a little bit here and there and that is why everything moves in this game at a snails pace. I do not believe their argument holds any merit considering we all know how to pause games so the only obvious conclusion is they love their micro transactions which then would entail that future games will not be as fun. as their focus is less about game play and more about money. Other companies who make great games let their works sell themselves because they concentrated on game play and fun and the money followed. People love to say how much mobile games are reaching console like quality but this is a prime example of mobile games simply aren't developed in the same way and thus unless something changes then they will never truly compete with consoles.,1
Having to check in every hour to keep a steady supply of materials is a real pain. I want to play the game not be a slave to it. There are better drains of your time if you like the freemium model of games.,1
Join my clan right away -golden ares,5
"Abusive use of microtransactions. It's hardly F2P, but rather PayToPlay. Your time better spent elsewhere.",1
Anemic game design that makes fun of aggressive IAP even as it gleefully foists them upon you.,1
"Free to wait, expensive to play. Dont download, just amother pay to play clash of clans. Shame, looks like it could have been a good game",1
Ea always prioritizes money over gameplay. Takes forver to get anything done. Terrible game. Also underhanded that you cant rate them under 5 in game. If you try they redirect you to their website.,1
"Lol What a load of crap, Crashed 5 mins into game play, uninstalling. N5 4.4.2 non-rooted stock.",1
"I remember playing this game when I was younger, playing for hours on end. I played this reboot hoping for the same game or at least something halfway decent, sadly no. Instead what I experienced was a mutilated deformed version of a great game. Needless to say I deleted this ""game"" as quickly as I could tap my tablet.",1
"Stop listing this as ""Free"".",1
Sucks,1
All of these in-game purchases in games to do things u could in the original D.K. games is simply ridiculous. Spending nearly $70 bucks to mine 56 tough blocks is absolutely insane. I really hope this model fades out sooner rather than later. I'd gladly shell out $5 to play a mobile updated version of D.K 1 or 2. But not this... thing.,2
,1
"The sad thing about this game is that there is a really good core hiding behind miles of the worst ""time gated"" ""pay to not wait"" crud I've ever seen. It makes waiting in line at the DMV seem good by comparison.  I would have gladly paid $5 to $10 for it without the garbage and a bit more content. I would love to raid my friend's dungeons but there is no way I could recommend the pain in this app for the limited fun payback.",2
Very cool game... BUT...love the upgrading and graphics.  Update: this game is very invasive on privacy. It wants everything about you. Uninstalled.,1
"If you want to pop in once or twice a day, play for a minute or two, basically redeploying minions and collecting from your mines, this is a fantastic game. If you want to actually play, be prepared to pay, constantly....... Even a few gem purchases will not get you very far, and the further you do get, the higher the price gets. Not worth it in my opinion.",1
"It is amazing, just brilliantly gruesome.",5
,1
I would happily pay 2 dollars for this game with out it  any Microtransactions and no annoying waiting but unfortunately they ruin what was at one point a fantastic game,1
Displays EA logo and then goes black.,1
"I loved the original but they've crippled gameplay by sending half a dozen notifications power hour and slowing progress dramatically after about a day.  I'd happily pay $60 for a remake, but I'm not going to endure constant nagging and not-so-micro payments just so I can advance to a slower and more expensive part of this game!",1
"This isn't even a game. It's the ability to pay someone to waste your time with nearly nothing in return. I loved the originals, this trash is an insult to the people who created those games.",1
"Dk 1&2 such amazing games. What happened EA, u break my heart &lt;/3.",1
Waiting a lot.   Wants you to buy gems.   Original game is far better.   Waste of time,1
"I understand the free to play model, that's cool. Makes money, I get it. But not having an offline mode and constantly getting disconnected is almost a deal breaker.",3
"Also, pay to play.",1
"If you haven't played it yet, do your research. There's an in-game pop up requesting you to rate the game for Google Play. Only a five star rating will let you continue unhindered while a 1-4 requests additional feedback while not actually submitting your rating. The only way to submit a rating less than 5 is to do so here in Google Play. I find this tactic to be  incredibly deceptive. This game is also a huge time sink, forcing you to wait several hours unless you're willing to fork out some dough.",1
"They did a great job bringing DK to the tablet. The game is free, and well thought out. Those that complain about needing to pay to get to the end game as quick as possible, can be unhappy all they want. The games pay content is appropriately priced for those that have to have it. The game discourages you from paying. The game pits you against other players that are at your level, so there is no hurry to try to get a high level. Some of the upgrades can take hours to build, but that is to keep the game paced and not finish it within a day. For those that love DK, this is a great game, and very well thought out. A ton of fun!",5
"Loved DK 1&2... This looks like those, but with micro payment speed walls to prevent enjoyment.  I'd pay $5-10 for DK on mobile, but EA wants $100's",1
Asking for in app ratings where you hit 5 it takes you to play to rate you hit 1-4 it takes you to EA instead.  Poor Play EA.,1
,1
Free to download but not much else. EA likes to earn their WCIA awards.,1
"In app purchases are ruining gaming, EA is ruining gaming.",1
,1
thanls alot i want a refund on gems bought,1
pay to wait then pay some more.  I am not spending money on this.,1
Don't waste your time.,1
Seriously? EA... Again?,1
"Great game, if they let you do quests and such repeatedly.  But they're all one time only.  It would take years to finish without paying.",1
I've heard too much about how this took a great game and butchered it into a freemium nightmare. The scheme to prevent people from giving less than five star ratings without going to the app store convinced me to do exactly that. I pity anyone who spends a penny on this.,1
What was once a great game has been ruined by IAP.,1
This isn't a reboot of dk... its not even the same genre,1
Finally available for the Galaxy Tab 3!,4
Best game on android hands down,5
Not so functional on moto x,1
"This annoyingly terrible remake is a painful reminder of how awful modern companies have become trying to scrape every last dollar from you they can.    See, this game isn't Dungeon Keeper, a remake of the classic PC game of yesteryear. This game is Dungeon Keeper, the endurance test.  Can you endure waiting five minutes for a room to build, or will you just pay the 1 gem fee to get it done in a reasonable amount of time?  Can you endure waiting a day for an imp to dig something or will you spend your precious gems to accelerate that?   Can you handle Horny egging you to spend all your gems to accelerate things and ignore him successfully or will you succumb and hand over your money to keep purchasing them from the in app store?   There was an interview where the developer claims you can get all the same features without having to purchase any gems, but what he doesn't say is that it will take the same amount of time to complete that way as Duke Nukem Forever took to come to fruition.    Thank xenu I still have the original.  I need to slap the s#!t out of some imps now to relieve my frustrations with this piece of crApp.",1
"While some of the things that originally made DK a great game and franchise are still in there, good luck ever getting to it without shelling out half your paycheck to avoid waiting hours on end of the EA wanting to stop you from playing the game. That is unless you give them an arm and a leg.",1
"Look down at the number of one star ratings for this game. You see that... it's a clue. Always pay more attention to the number of one star reviews. Those 5 star reviews are just clutter.  I loved the original dungeon keeper, I played it for many hours. I bought it and received the entire game.  I was happy and the developer was happy.  This could be an awesome game too if I would just be allowed to buy it. Instead I am forced to either pay outrageous fees to continue to play it, or play for about 60 seconds once each 4 hours.  Do the developers seriously think that I am going to pay $50 repeatedly for virtual coins to dump into this mobile game?  If they do they have no clue.  Also, if you install the app it has annoying audio push notifications that will make your phone announce things like ""KEEPER YOUR MINIONS ARE READY"" during business meetings and dates.  If Google Play allowed people to vote less than 1 star, most people would.",1
Takes one of the best games ever made and turns into a slog. Avoid at all costs.,1
,1
Nothing like the original.  Would of preferred a full priced game rather than waiting hours to do an action or having to pay for it.,1
,1
Unplayable game due to reward timing loop and pay to win structure.,1
Most annoying is the way it games feedback in order to trick people into only leaving 5-star reviews. AVOID!!!!,1
So sad EA.,1
This game is an insult not only to dungeon keeper but to the games industry.,1
Seriously guys.. Making me decide to rate it be for I've even tried it. Or having all these bad iap? If you would have charged $5 for the game I would have purchased it as it stands... This is just a greedy cash grab.,1
"Dungeon keeper is an apt name, as you systematically imprison any moment of fun by playing this game.",1
Read up on it online to see why. Don't get it.,1
I loved the old games. This is nothing like that. This is pay to play.,1
,1
"It's an ok game that is very much a watered down version of the original.  The other rather annoying ""feature"" is the overly dependent micro-transaction model that they chose to go with.  Sad to see this happen from a once great company (Mythic) and the way they trivialized the original IP",2
You have to wait literally days before you can actually do anything in this game. Pay to play,1
"Unfortunately, this great IP has been ruined with the IAP. I tried to play it a bit but couldn't enjoy the classic Dungeon Keeper experience.",1
Takes days weeks and hours to do anything unless you shell out cash for gems,2
I get that EA wants $$ but cant they just let me.pay for a full game instead of having absurd timers. Pay to play fail.,1
Game is cool but you won't get far without paying vast sums of money. Not worth the money either. Takes for ever to do anything. Want something built now? It will cost you $$$ or you can wait 4-24 hours and come back later.,2
"It's not actually playable without spending lots of real money in-game, unless you care to camp out on the app all day long.  Too bad, I had a fondness for the old dungeon keeper.  This game treats the player like an ATM with a tapping finger.  I uninstalled it.",1
"Total garbage, don't waste your time",1
Don't know what money grubbing pukes made this up but just highlights how sad mobile gaming has become,1
Randomly exited the game 3 times and my progress was lost even though I was logged in.  I'm deleting it.,1
"A greedy and uncaring Dev ruins this game, with tricks to get better reviews, and devious ways to get you to keep accepting email updates.",1
"Well, ok, it wants you to spend your gems to 'speed things up', letting you know they will give you more later...from everything I'd heard about this game, they'd said gems are only possible to get by either paying for them, or getting lucky in an event, so I didn't want to spend them.  One of my tasks gave me a wait time of a few minutes, so I set the phone down during the tutorial, got distracted...and was asked to re-connect.  No big deal, re-connected...and found out I'd just lost all my progress, because I waited too long.  If you can't even clear the tutorial without having to either constantly watch your phone, or spend your gems...Yeah, the game is being un-installed now!",1
"Great way to ruin a fun franchise by making you wait 1 day to dig dirt.  Imagine playing tick tac toe and being forced to wait 1 day to place an X.  Here's a suggestion, go to Good old games and buy the original.",1
"I would have rated it higher, but the inability to play the game (solo) without a wifi connection limits it to a ""3"" -1 after considering the paywall for a total of two  EA should consider a pay version that removes those restrictions, and lets us simple play a classic game.",2
Program will not advance beyond update check. Completely nonfunctional.,1
"As a free to play game, you really can't get build very fast without paying excessive micro transactions. I understand that developers want to make money off of their games, but this game charges way too much for their ""premium"" item, Gems.   One of the most important things you need to buy first are imps. Basically your servants that are required to build/dig in the game. You get two to start, and then find out the third imp is 800 gems. After finishing the tutorial you end up with just over 400 gems, so a quick trip to the store shows that it only costs $5 for another 500 gems to get a third worker. I don't even want to know that the fourth through sixth imps cost.  I am not against paying for the premium items in the games I really like. That said, they are asking WAY too much for their premium currency. If it was 1/10 the cost, I might even keep playing.  Save your money and go try another free to play game. This one will leave you eating Ramen noodles by the end of the week.",1
"This is a tragic abuse of the DM  franchise. Worst application of freemium yet. If you like playing for 1 mibute every hour, then by all mwans download this. I was so excited...",1
"Another classic IP butchered by EA into a pay to win mess. In game ratings force you into 5 star reviews as well, really sad",1
Too much reliance on micro transactions and very long delays between carving of stone - changed from 5 star to 3 star.  Could have been much more.,3
"I hate games that insist that I give you a review.  If you want my feedback, ask for it via email; don't harass me during the game itself.",1
This game is unplayable unless u pay money to get stuff done faster or forced to wait 4-5hrs to get stuff done,1
Garbage. Pay to pay to play.. Yet another piece of crap from EA.,1
F U EA! Why do you need to ruin every game you touch with your money grabbing microtransaction bullshit.,2
Terrible.,1
,1
Pay-to-win is ruining mobile games. EA is an awful company.,1
Pay to mine blocks or wait a ridiculously long time. Better idea is save your money and buy a non EA copy of DK. Nice job destroying a great legacy.,1
This game proves just how awful the freemium model is. It constantly bombards you with the need to spend money on resources and this essentially ruins and breaks the game. Do not support freemium sales models and do not support EA by spending money or even downloading this awful excuse for a game. I'd rate it less than one star if I could.,1
Terrible adaptation of the original unless you pay $$ for upgrades. EA blows another easy win.,1
,1
This game is utter garbage and exists only as a shameless cash grab using a beloved IP. Don't even waste your time. This is NOTHING like DK and DK2.,1
"This is not a game, this is a timer with a ui, that needs money to stop. In no way shape or form is this a game. Shame on you EA.",1
"Denegration of a venerable franchise, all in the name of making a quick buck.",1
Not very exciting. Like other EA games if you don't pay you have to wait hours to get anything meaningful done. Promptly deleted after 2 days of play. Kinda sad I was really looking forward to this old classic.,1
"This game embodies everything that is wrong with microtransactions. It barely qualifies as a game. Stay clear. Instead, try playing a game like Dungelot.",1
"Like others, I think this could be an enjoyable experience if I a) had the patience of a saint or b) had the money to move the game along at a reasonable pace. I would be willing to complete tasks for gems (required to get anywhere), but there is no way I'm paying between $5 and $99 to make headway in the game. Until EA comes to its senses, I'm out!",2
"Nothing new.   No challenge.  No decisions really matters as anything destroyed is automatically rebuilt. Storyline is nonexistent.  How many times are they going to create the same drivel, put a shiny new skin on it, and pass it off as a different game?",1
$50 to get anywhere on the game and that goes pretty quick before yoy need another $50.,1
Destroyed a classic :(,1
It was my accountant warning me I can't afford to play this game with its pay to play IAP model.,1
Once again EA ruins a classic series from their backlog in the name of quick cash. I hate pay to wait games.,1
"You can't do anything meaningful unless you spend a lot of money in gems, or wait years to be able to get the relevant items. Deleting it after playing for a few days...",1
"Overt money grab, no redeeming features that are not overshadowed by the in app purchases.",1
"Which is the reason why I haven't spent a cent on an EA game since The Old Republic. Please don't spend a dime on this game, it just helps EA justify their terrible business model that puts players last.",1
So here is a 1 star,1
,1
"At first I was super excited to play DK on my Android.  I had loads of fun with it years ago on PC.  After installing the game and walking through the tutorial my experience went from fun to frustrating.  You're given a ration of ""speed up' items to complete tasks faster in order to progress (option to buy more) and that was the end of it for me.  I'd have happily paid $5-10 for a properly executed version of DK or DKII, but this is a bunch of crap.  The main reason I don't game on my phone or tablet is all this junkware requiring payment for reasonable progress.",1
The sound and graphics are probably the only redeeming qualities to this title... Other than that it will waste your time and frustrate you trying to play the game using the freemium model (which requires deep pockets) to accomplish anything...  I look forward to a full paid version that does not insult my intelligence by forcing me to pay for things that were standard in the 20 year old PC version...,1
"Lots of fun, can't wait to spend more time with this game. Thanks!",5
"It would be a good game if it weren't for the free-to-play garbage. As it is, it's a joke. It takes a week or two to do what took 5 minutes in the original.",1
Actually now that I think about it trash can be more fun.,1
,1
"This game is as other people described it to be and they were right it's nothing but a cash grab filled with micro transaction using the Dungeon Keeper to get fan to pay. I get that free to play games need some way to make money but waiting 4 hours to a full day to dig, beep that. Imps after the 2nd cost a lot of gems. If your a fan of the older Dungeon Keeper games stay far away from this p2p cash grab and play an older version you will save money and have a lot of more fun.",1
"Have to wait hours for my minions to do things, unless I pay that is.",1
Would like to have an option to buy the game that would then open up everything you and not have to spend ridiculous amounts of money.  Tired of EA telling me how I should play a game.,2
EA YOUR GAME IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD! Thanks for ruining the memory of another classic game!,1
"Way to screw up a good game with pay to win style 's, sorry looks great but the factor of having to pay to do anything in any timely manner just puts me off. Instead of making garbage like this work on a real dungeon keeper 3",1
EA really has a zinger here. This could have been a good game if they did not exploit the in-app purchase element. Childhood dreams of a DK3 = destroyed.,1
This IS a fun game but the extra costs are not worth it. A 4x planetary game will simliar idea would be fun but if the costs are the same none would be worth it.,3
"Over the top IAPs: check. Tediously slow mechanics: check. Biased review pop-ups: check.  As with PvZ2, I'll keep an eye out for a paid version of this game.  For now, I think I'll skip the F2P.",1
"EA has severely messed up this great franchise by taking it from its puzzle-solving roots to a mindless, timer-based, cash grabbing Tiny Towers F2P clone. It also prohibits players from rating anything less than 5 stars from within the app. How this sort of tactic is allowed by Google, I can't fathom.",1
Visually great but honestly a massive  disappointment. Shameful in comparison to what was a great franchise.,2
"This game was fun for the first half hour. It really was neat. However without spending half of my phone bill for currency to ""speed"" up my farming, I won't be having another solid half hour of fun again until three days. That's being generous.",1
Let me just buy the game instead of unplayable without MTs.,2
very expensive for a 'free' game. Completely destroys the classic dungeon keeper franchise. Do not bother with this one.,1
"Game asks you to rate, and if you choose 1-4 stars, takes you to EA private feedback system.  Hiding negative reviews from Google Play is super shady, EA",1
"If this was a bent over greased toddler, the catholic church wouldn't touch it",1
"As usual, server issues make the game impossible to play, and when you aren't replying the first 5 minutes of the game repeatedly, you get to enjoy a Clash of Clans knock off. Thanks for taking my favorite childhood game and turning it into a cheap money grab. Fix the server issue and I may give you an additional star.",1
Game is near useless without paying money.,1

"Fun little game, but progress is too slow, and gem pricing is too high",3
Please insert 5 dollars to continue reading this review.,1
Could have been a great game. The original is still incredible and fortunately still available for like $5. In this version the game play is tedious and expensive. Free to play at it's worst. It has none of the charm of the original.  PS: lets not forget dumb moves like making it hard to rate the game anything but a 5 star. Which it most certainly is not.,1
Pay to play the amount of money it costs for the transactions is ridiculous worst game ive ever seen when it comes to transactions leave it up to ea to ruin everything,1
"EA is shooting for more ""Worst Company"" awards with this one. Microtransactions are all but forced upon the player as without them the game plays at an unbearably slow pace (DAYS to accomplish minor tasks). What's more, when asked by the game to rate the app, if you select anything other than 5 stars, you're sent to an EA feedback page rather than the app store review page. There's no doubt that a lot of low-star reviews are missing because of this disgusting deception. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME.",1
EA has eviscerated a classic this time. Don't listen to any of the good reviews. This is almost nothing like the classic. You could have had 20 imps by the time you can afford(in game gems) a third in this. Slow mining times render this game pointless unless you are ready to drop a boatload of cash(USD). You had a great opportunity here EA and you did exactly what anyone that is familiar with you knows you were going to do. Greed!,2
Free2Play is no way DK should be played,1
"I don't know what's worse: EA stacking the deck so only those who want to give this trash 5-stars can do so directly from the app (if you click ""Vote 1-4 stars"" you're brought to a private webpage outside of Google Play where your review will most likely never be read), or EA taking a beloved franchise like Dungeon Keeper and completely destroying the essence of what should be an incredibly fun experience.  Do not be fooled by the stacked 5-star rating this app has - google this game and read about just how bad this game really is.  EA, you should be ashamed for releasing such a terrible game - and once again giving F2P games another black mark.  And doubly ashamed for ruining the name of yet another old, legendary franchise.",1

Extremely Bad. Will never play an EA game again,1

"Why do I have to login to my google + account to play this game???????????  Nothing like the original, complete garbage, slow, poor play quality, overpriced and you really do have to spend money to get anywhere..  COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME",1
"The game has a similar model to other FTP strategy games. It is.micro transaction based, and everything is based off real time. The cost of the first additional builder is identical to clash ofclans (5$) as well as the second build (10$). It's based off the old dungeon keeper games but built with the mobile model in.mind. it  I enjoy it, and have played both of.the pc versions old.and new as well as this. It functions like a tower defense and a reverse tower defense depending if your attacking or defending.",5
Poop Poop,1
"Sad cash grab of a ""game"".",1
"Not only is the this game draining people of money for time, it also blocks negative feedback in app! You have to get on play just to leave bad feedback. When will EA learn? Don't be a sucker",1
I had a lot of fun playing this game but it keeps freezing on me and auto disconnects for some reason. Sometimes if I reopen it the game malfunctions and it makes me start back at the tutorial. Then I restart the game and it goes back to my current dungeon. THEN the process starts over again. Fix and I'll give 5 stars!!,3
To bad they're aren't others like it. !,5

"Seems to just be a way to squeeze out money from people.  That being said, if you are only looking to play a game for two minutes at a time this is your game I guess.",1
,1
Its bull your update made me lose alll!!!!!!! My krap,2
It doesn't play at all keeps crashing. It even crashed on my iPad,1
Just a clash of clans clone with the Dungeon Keeper IP.,1
Expect 4+ hour waits to dig one block unless you pay.  This is a clash of clans rip off with added EA greed.  You can't even rate it less than 5 stars from within the game.  Terrible game redesign to what could of been an amazing remake.,1
"Slow timing, not graphics performance.",1
Microtransactions galore.,1
,2
"But I absolutely won't spend it on this cash cow abomination.  24k+ five star ratings is a blatant lie and very obvious corporate manipulation.   It's like they took the corpse of a once fantastic hero (or keeper in this case) and reanimated it into a lifeless, souless monstrasity. Oh wait.... That's exactly what they did.",1
,1
"Thanks, EA, for taking a favorite game from my younger years and turning it into a cash cow.  You suck for this, and I'll remember it when considering EA games on ANY platform.  I would have paid as much as $30 for this game on Android, but you had to try to suck money out of everybody instead.  Not everything is going to work like Candy Crush, and I can't stand you for wrecking my memories for a quick buck!",1
On lip Lilli PNP,5
"Graphics are good but it's the same as many new Facebook and mobile games. This new concept involving wait to play just signals laziness on a previously great game. If you make a great game,  you don't need wait to play. Its like encouraging players to stop playing once out of level 5. Also, requires Internet to play, so good luck using it waiting for an appointment.",2
Too long to do anything and they want u to buy gems just to be able to make it reasonable,2
I really enjoyed this game at the beginning.   But after a couple days it becomes evident that you will not progress very far without laying down some cash.   A LOT of cash.  Would not recommend.,1
"It's a reskin of clash of clans. I would rather have an HD version of DK2. If anything, fix the issue where it says I have all my imps busy when it  clearly shows I have 1 out of 2 not busy.",3
Ruined the DK franchise with ridiculous micropayments to actually do anything. Stay away.,1
"Too many ""currencies"" (which can all be bought of course), the tutorial constantly encourages you to spend your limited gems to rush build times, and the costs and times to build are so inflated it's nearly impossible to play this game for more than 5 minutes without spending any cash once you've progressed beyond the early stages. Ridiculously blatant free - to - play junk, not sure how anyone rates this more than one star.",1
"How does it feel to play this? Imagine seeing your high-school crush years later panhandling. This ""game"" sucks so hard that light cannot escape.",1
Total disgrace of a game that tarnishes the memory of a classic.,1
The fact that EA thinks this is okay is just pathetic,1
"This is a bastardization of the classic. EA has sold the souls their company was built on to cash in on a once respected title. To do anything meaningful in this game requires the use of rush gems which cost real world $, enjoy paying your cash for faster completion of tasks and being hounded into paying again and again and again.",1
,1
This game is absolute trash and an insult to the original. An action that took 24 seconds in the original now takes 24 hours unless you spend a massively expensive ransom.,1
I understand the wait times as its a casual play a few times a day kind of game but the requirements to upgrade take enormous leaps and make it absurd to get anywhere without paying money.,1
"It's a bad tower defense clone that pretty much requires micro- trans to advance at all. I don't mind freemium games being slower for free players, that's expected. But this game makes it way too much of a grind for too small a sense of advancement. Plus, it lacks the charm and wit of the original.",1
I liked it untill it Started all over from the beginning!,1
"I used to play the PC version of this game years ago so when I saw this was an app I was extremely excited to try it out.  Gameplay is fun, graphics awesome and all the dark humor that made the original so fantastic is there as well. So why three stars? $#&@ pay to play! The balance is better than most games but they strategically made some things so out of reach that you'd have to buy gems to ever get anywhere. $99 for gems? Who pays that?! Go buy the pc version at any walmart for $5!!",3
"Represents perhaps the worst of the worst when it comes to exploiting the naive consumer, especially since in game ratings steer people towards a 5 star rating. Do yourself a favor, avoid this Skinner-box as cash grab.",1
Do not waste your time or phone memory on this utter utter tosh,1
,1
"Whenever I open the app it says it can not connect, then I hit the retry square, it goes to the connecting screen, but the connecting screen never changes.",2
Game would be great if you could actually play it without spending an arm and a leg to dig out some of the blocks.,1
This is a joke the IAP are way outta control. Use gems to get anything done . No auto harvest of resources while away. etc etc etc. If you want to play this for any amount of time be prepared to pay a lot!!!   Overall Just not fun.,1
"It's one thing if they just help, but they're pretty much required in this game. Surprise, EA did in the fun on an old game that was awesome before they turned it into a cash drain attempt.",1
,1
"Another pay or wait game by EA. Shell out money if you don't want to sit around and wait. Also EA won't let you rate it less than 5 stars in the app, you have to come directly to the play store to do it. EA seems to go out of their way to be the worst company year after year. Im sure they are laughing at us all the way to the bank.",1
You cant do anything on this game without buying gems. You can basically do one thing a day,1
This is not the dungeon keeper I remember.,1
The game moves at such a slow pace you can't truly get anything done without paying for gems. Users who have paid will be attacking you outright so you can't save your resources to upgrade. You are tricked into thinking you can make a stand against enemy players but that's a lie. I'm  alright with micro transactions but not when they are the core of the game play experience. Avoid this as your time would be better spent playing anything other than dungeon keeper.,1
,1
Back to the PC for me!,1
Wow this game is broken.  Unlike PvZ 2 or Plague Inc (where you can accelerate unlockables) this game is unlpayable if you don't buy the in game currency. Trust EA to go super corporate and tuin another IP.,1
"Yeah the app says its free, but if you want to get anywhere without wasting months to get there you have to buy the gems. I would rather pay one time instead of using micro transactions.",1
"I'm long since sick of this model that devs are using to scam a handful of fools out of hundreds instead of giving millions a solid title for $5. Typical EA. When will they realize no sane person is going to dump $100 on a tablet game when anything on a PC will crush it for $19.95? Are there really that many stupid people out there that makes this more profitable?   A prime example of why I've blackballed anything with an EA logo on it for almost a decade now. Just look at what they've done with the Sims franchise for a perfect definition of milking your customers.  The play store needs to add a category for apps titled ""IAP required"" so users can vote apps into it and get these money grabs off the ""top downloaded"" page which is the ONLY reason these are free to install.",1
My wife loves this game she just love too slap the miones around y'all,5
Just wanted the game I remembered and loved this is pretty dull and costly,1
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 24 hours or pay to dig a rock? Are you high?,1
Pay to play/wait. Disgraceful rape of what was one of the better games of yesteryear.,1
"If you enter a &lt;5 star review in app, it isn't posted here...",1
Too many micro transactions to get anything done most of the game is waiting unless you spend a ton of actual money on it to get done faster get the original dungeon keeper on PC easily better then this,1
Way to expensive and way to much down time.  It really hurts seeing this kind of stuff done to a great game franchise that I used to really love playing.,1
Pay to play.  Also not a true  Dungeon Keeper experience.,1
Game is Poop don't waste your time,1
They ruin the game.,1
"Way to screw a classic, I see EA are still putting profits before product again, obviously learnt nothing from BF4.",2
One star for you!,1
This game doesn't always work and when it doesn't it resets your dungeon.,1
"As a long time fan of the DK series, I was thrilled to see a new game finally came out after Bullfrog went under years ago before DK3 made it's release. That is, until I actually got into the game. This vaguely resembles previous titles, recycling old concepts and putting a modern ""pay-to-play"" emphasis on it. EA, you destroyed a great series. If you really want to make money, make DK3 a reality and cash in on it's former glory.",1
,1
Longer wait times than even clash of clans.,1
This game is a disgrace to the original dungeon keeper. Oh and EA tried to deceive me into giving this crap 5 stars... every time I tried to rate it less than 5 stars in game they tried to make me fill out a feedback report to them rather than be able to report it in the app store. I had to say I was rating it 5 stars and then I just didn't ... can you get any shadier EA?,1
I was hoping for a game much like the pc version but it's not. This game is very much like other popular games out there. It's expensive to get anywhere at a decent speed. I would pay dearly to have my beloved DK for my phone. ;-) It's really too bad the EA didn't put more thought into what fans of the original game would expect. Greed took over once again I guess.,1
There should be an option to buy outright for $9.99 or so and get unlimited gems. The micro transaction model for this game is extreme in cost.,1
Horrible game that destroys a classic.  Filled with pitiful begging to buy and spend gems this game its just sad.  Only download if you want to play for seconds at a time or have lots of money lying around that you have no better use for than burning.,1
"The amount of actions you can do in one sitting is terrible!! It takes forever to do more Than one or two actions.  Also, the area is to small for the buildings being so big and you cannot move the ""dungeon heart"" which if that dies, you lose",2
So.glad to.see this game return,2
Micro transactions. Micro transactions everywhere. Wait 2 days for things to finish or give them money..,1
This game is everything wrong with mobile gaming and the free to play fad.,1
"Just like they did with PvZ 2, EA ruins another great IP with shady pay or wait mechanics. And that's on top of fixing up the ratings of this crap game by not letting you rate anything but 5 stars from inside the app. EA sucks and thinks we are stupid. And you if you thow money at this game. This abuse from EA needs to stop.",1
"EA has, in all, taken one of the most played PC games into a ""free"" game that is so riddled with in app purchases that the game is near unplayable. Actions that took a matter of seconds in the original game are now set to take hours and hours. Not to mention that EA has set up the in game review links to, rather than send all players to the Google play store page, anyone that wants to rate the game below a 5 is asked to send an email to EA. Do not believe the high ratings. This game is pay to play.",1
Love the original so I was excited about this game. 10 minutes in you finish the tutorial and after a couple of quick actions you get stuck waiting tons of time. Google the game for more nasty stuff about the game.,1
Stay away this is terrible,1
,2
They tried to force me to give the game five stars.,1
Play for 15 minutes wait 4 hours. Sucks when takes more time to wait than to play.,2
"The game is what I call crippleware.  It gives you a taste, then you have to either wait days for your imps to do anything, or pay out the wazoo to get things moving, just for a little while.  It's the worst kind of ""micro-transactions"" possible, since it's continuous, to unlock the ability to make the game work properly,, rather than one time unlockables.  It's horrible.  I was looking for a worthy successor to Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2, but this, well, it's steaming.  Thanks EA.",1
Pay 2 win,2
"Fantastic execution of a terrible, terrible collection of business decisions.  One big problem with the execution: sound is chopped to death on my nexus4, making it unplayable and ruining all the really good voice acting.  But really, who cares. The paywalls make this game unplayable and then some, anyways.",1
"In 10 minutes it has restarted a bunch of times, every time it asks me to share everything with everyone on the web. Game seems to be unlike the old dungeon keeper it alludes to be. Game is pay or wait. There are simply better games to spend your time on.",2
I played the original Dungeon Keeper back when it came out.   This is a crappy money grabbing clone.  It was turned into one of those do something then wait several hours to do something else.   By the time my last action finishes I have forgotten what I was going to do next!  It would take me 2 weeks to do what I could do in 30 minutes with the old game.  Sure I can use gems to speed things up...  But when I run out I have to pay cash to get more.  To top it off the game is soo scammy that it has a regular popup asking you to give it 5 stars.  Apps shout not be allowed to set the number of stars for you.  They should only be allowed to give you the review dialog from the Play Store and have NO star rank filled in.   Just avoid this game and play anything else.,1
"Can't even call these ""micro"" transactions. It's a travesty to call this a game and worse to name it after one of the greatest games ever made. Anyone who gives this PoS more than one star is a fool.",1
Simply cannot get past the tutorial,1
Shameful money grabbing by this company hinders the quality of this old time classic,1
"I personally despise what EA has done to a classic game. The pay wall is not at all what people want, not to mention shady practices that seem to be occurring outside regarding reviews. Here I had hopes that EA would fix their problems and be a good company again but I'm back to being very skeptical.",1
"It was cheaper to buy the entire game a couple decades ago! EA is going too far with their in game purchases. The game won't even let you give it a low ranking, you have to close it and rank the game right in google play itself.",1
Costs too much. And takes forever to get anything done.,2
Paywalls and crappyness all the way! Cheers EA for taking a beloved IP and sucking all of the heart out of it. I hope you make many dollars and it is all totally worth it because you have lost a customer right here.,1
And requires an internet connection to play,1
"I would rather pay money for a port of the old game than put up with the ""pay us or wait 24 hours"" model that mobile ""games"" use now. I cant blame them though everyone else is doing it too",2

Please change this game back to the way it was on the P.C. you guys really messed up a classic. People if you think this game is fun then you should find it for your computer. The old school game it will blow your mind. Let me know when you change it back. Bad move guys. Sometimes things are better the way they were.,1
The on app rating system does not let you give it less than five starts. Bad EA.,1
"Congratulations EA, you've successfully killed another thing I loved.  I hope you all burn for this.",1
Cheap knock off and too expensive,1
Wow EA thanks for ruining an otherwise great game.,1
"This is a shameful cash-in that soils the original IP. The pay walls in this ""game"" are ridiculous. It plays like a browser game unless you pour ridiculous amounts of cash into it. I wonder who the audience for this trash is? If you consider yourself a gamer and you are paying for this garbage: you are the problem.",1
.. You know they will eventually fail! Another garbage product showing what corporations will do if left to their own processes,1
Original much better.,1
From five star rating to one star. It made me start my whole game over from the beginning. Thank you ea for a disappointing experience. If I can get my prior game state back it may return to a five star. Thanks but no thanks. Just glad I didn't put money into this game yet.,1
"Game shows promise, but too many downsides make it unfun.",2
"I loved Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 for the PC. Absolutely loved em. Hell I'll still install them every once in a while, and while this game on first glance looks like them all shined up and HD, it is nowhere near the playing experience. Uninstalled after less than an hour of play. Nice try EA. Stick to the Sims and mass produced sports games.",1
I am a dungeon keeper fan. I played Bullfogs Dungeon Keeper 2 Today. This is a slap in the face to everyone who loved and wanted a real dungeon keeper type game. INSTEAD. You gave us poorly repackaged Clash of clans.   I am uninstalling. And if there ever is a release for the PC. This game has given me pause for even giving that a shot.  Shame on you for milking a good game and executing the interface  with stale ideas.,1
"I was inclined to give this game five stars just from nostalgia but... unless you spend big bucks on ""gems"" you are limited to five minutes of an upkeep style of play every day. If there is going to be that much emphasis on using ""gems"" (how am I going to get 800 gems for another imp?!)there should be larger rewards while playing. I am basing my eating on the pay to play aspect. I might have spent three bucks on this game if it meant I didn't have to use effing gems.",2
I love the first two dungeon keeper games. I don't like a game where you wait 24 hours to spawn a minion.,1
EA is literally Hitler,1
Don't even bother playing this game unless you have either a very high tolerance for waiting around doing nothing or making a crazy amount of IAP to get anything to happen in this eon.,1
Huge fan of the original DK games and was very excited to see this. Keyword=was. EA raped this awesome game and are trying to sell the leftovers. You can't even dig a tunnel in this game without waiting for two weeks or paying 100 bucks. Free in name only. EA I would gladly pay for this game if you put a price on it and cut the bs in game monetization and make it actually playable.,1
,1
"I can wait 24 hours to mine a block. Or I can pay to mine it wayyy faster. This is an abysmal ""game"" which is just a terrible cash grab. Stay far far away.",1
"The tutorial begins by teaching the player how to spend gems, the IAP currency, on speeding things up. It emphasizes the point by not letting you back out of the prompt to spend gems until the build timer for tutorial builds naturally run out. The time it takes to upgrade or train ramps up significantly after a few levels. Resource costs are not an issue (for me yet) if you pvp and defend well.  The game asked me to give a five star review in game, anything lower led to a feedback sheet instead of Google Play. Only reason I did not give 1 star was because the pvp is fun and the tower defense aspect is interesting for dungeon design, especially if you do not spend money on the game and have to dig the 24 hour blocks one by one. The social aspect is interesting, but does not outshine the faults of the pay system. Huge waste of time and battery life.  The other DK games came out when I was younger and I enjoyed them immensely. I can appreciate this as its own game, but I would have liked to see a full priced game without these ridiculous pay gates. Instead of spending 50-60 dollars for a real game, you get nothing from me for this game.",2

"Was super happy to see this app in the store. Installed was having a good time until hit brick wall...that would take 24 hours per block to take down....and the prices on the amount of gems you can buy is absurd. Don't bother with this anything but ""free to play"". Should be made to take it out of f2p category.....",1
"I loved this game on pc.  The micro transactions in this version are beyond ridiculous.   Once again proving that EA is the Michael Eisner of video games.  My inner child is crying.   As long as corporations continue with flagrant corruptions like this, long live piracy.  I would have happily paid a one time fee for this app.",1
Disappointed that EA has resorted to 5 star vote funneling. Greedy corporations at their best.,1
"This game is nothing but a pay to play 'trial' game almost, using a very wanted IP name because if it didn't have the name nobody would even look twice. I played this for five minutes before I was asked to wait hours or shell out real money for this crap.  If I'm going to be forced into paying for a game just for basic features, I'll stick to my PC MMO games. Way to necro a very wanted yet dead franchise for more cheap cash, EA.",1
Another classic gameplay formula ruined by the freemium treatment.,1
"Hey EA you know what would have made a good game? An actual DK RTS, FFS. Enjoy Clash of Clans? Want to play a game where the biggest appeal is the thought of its 17 and 15 year old predessors? Willing to pay waayyy to much to enjoy a game when a single price to start would have been just fine?   Then THIS is the game for you!... I was so exited at first. 2 minutes in and it is just clash of clans wearing the hollowed out remains of Horney. Rest in peace Bullfrog.",3
Cool free game,4
"This game is an expensive scam.  The pay to play model of this game means I either have to wait a DAY between moves, or pay AE for the privilege of playing my game, on my hardware.  To top it off they are gaming the rating system by forcing people to jump through hoops to rate them anything other than 5 stars.  Avoid this at all costs. I wish there were a way to award it zero stars, because 1 is too many.",1
I loved the PC version but they made this version just sitting around and if you don't spend money on gems you won't get anywhere,1

"At least its got that part down. But then, it destroyed the IP I love... Worst company ever.  EA has become the serial killer of good video games.",1
The worst example of pay to play and micro transactions that I've seen in a long time. Nothing but a pure money grab attempt to cash in on a nostalgic brand by EA.,1

"If I wanted to be nickeled and dimed, I would have married a Kardashian.",1
This is a soulless cash in on a beloved game that captures none of the magic of the originals. Full of pay to play bullshit microtransactions.,1
As so many have pointed out if they simply released a pay up front game it would be great. But this micro transactions and wait to play system is beyond ridiculous.,1
Insane prices,1
"This is a deceptive ""game"" which won't post my review in goggle play unless I give it 5 stars.",1
57 seconds into the game I was asked to spend money. When asked for feedback if I gave anything less than 5 stars EA tried to hide my feedback by taking it privately. Give me a real dungeon keeper game. Not this watered down cash begging drivel.,1
Every time I go to load it I can never get past the connecting screen. Really big downer. I was a huge fan of dk and dk2 for the pc.,2
An opportunity to bring a great game to mobile devices squandered by corporate greed and disdain for the consumer.  What was once an enjoyable game is made unplayable by incessant and invasive in-app purchases required to progress.,1
I hate how it's the same old tired sleazeware game format.,1

Not worth anything,1
Designed only to bleed your wallet. 24 hours to clear 1 block when you only get 2 workers is disgusting,1

Not worth my time or money. Don't waste yours.,1
Pay to play fleecing. Avoid like the plague it is.,1
This is not a game this is a cow clicker it is a poor excuse for a money grab to milk the player of all their hard earned cash and it doesn't even do it didn't even the most remotely remote polite way it is here to take your money and put it in his pocket do not even look at it tonight even buy it it is a very very poor excuse for a game and I use the term game extremely loosely for this!!! I am highly disappointed in you Electronic Arts highly disappointed!!!,1
"Free to play is a joke. This game nickel and dimes you around every corner. Shame on EA, if you wanna enjoy the original buy it from good old games.",1
Only free if you don't want to get anywhere in the game. Scam!,1

Go listen to TotalBiscuits opinion of it.,1
The game here could be any of the 200 games on the play store. The only difference is it is skinned with images from the old Dungeon Keeper game. If you want to play another game which relies on in game purchases then download this game otherwise you should pass.,2
"Game devolves into a pay to play game... Unfortunate. It sort of baits you in, and then things start to cost a lot of time and money, but spend real dollars to speed it up.",1
Who else?,1
EA is funneling out bad reviews like the Nazis they are but anyways this game was only made to make money not give the gamer or anyone a good time. They lure you in and make the first hour or so fun then they drop the .99¬¢ bs. Terrible game would give it 0/5.,1

"Dk was great back in the day. Awesome to see a reboot on my phone! Theme hospital is amazing, do that next please!",5
Hey EAgames please make a command and conquer game for smartphones and tablets! After they canceled he pc game we need a game that can at least calm us down enjoy till there is a new game . It would be great thanks,5
"Like others have said, this game is play to start. EA should of released a demo and then had the full version available for $9.99.",2
"If they wanted you to spend money on the game, they should have made it a pay to play. Instead, they gate content behind HUGE pay-walls that you absolutely can't get around for free. EA is such a greedy company. Shame on you EA for not only allowing this practice, but for enforcing it on a beloved cult classic, remake like this. I hope you realize these practices will lose you business in the long run.",1
Forced decietful rating scam,1
Finally,5
"If you've ever played dungeon keeper before, this game really isn't anything like it. Not a realtime version anyway. But the quality put into the visuals and audio are great, and the game manages to be captivating in ways that other time consuming mobile tap games just fail at completely. HOWEVER, the f2p model in this game is broken beyond all belief, and if you don't want to invest time in this game, you will not enjoy it. I'd much rather see a new pc remake, but EA couldn't fix a lightbulb. This game isn't as bad as everyone is saying. It's not DK, but it's not worth bashing because of the name.",4
"Nothing like the original game.   Basically just a pay(a _lot_) to play.   I do not mind paying for a game, but this is way over the top.",1
"Not free to play, pay out the rear to play. This game had promise, but I'm not going to keep putting quarters into this money pit to use features that should just be ""part of the game"".",1
,1
I've been waiting for a dungeon keeper reboot for YEARS and I finally get THIS? Ugh. You've ruined it.,1
,1
"An absolute mockery of a beloved franchise game. The only thing that is ""dungeon keeper"" about this game is the name. Fans of dungeon keeper should avoid this like a plague.",1
"The amount of absurd pay gates on this game takes the term ""free to play"" and make it ""free to start"". Ridiculous that people accept these pricing schemes.",1
Greedy with micro transactions. Ruined this game's potential. Nice job EA.,1
Funny run the other than the way you you can you ‚ô¶‚Ü©‚Üï‚Üï‚Üï‚Üï.,5
"In app purchase are a blind money grab. Wish I could go lower. Also, EA blocks rating lower than a 4 in the game. Need to go to play store to leave a real review.  Do not download.",1
Can't do anything in the game without buying gems.,1
"Shameful copy, and not worthy of the Dungeon Keeper name.",1
"Bleed you dry with in-app purchases, and make it difficult to rate anything but 5 stars by redirecting you to something other than the play store if you want to give it any less.",1
"I would have bought it at a single price, but I won't go to micro transactions just for a playable game.",1
Get up to the part where I need to name the dungeon but no keyboard appears. So I am stuck no more than 5 minutes into the game,1
Suck a chode EA,1
Fun for the first little bit (likely where the 5 star votes come from).  Then turns into an agonizing experiment to extort big bucks and time from the simple minded.  Shame on you ea.  I'd rather pay for a decent game i can enjoy.,1
This has to be an extreme example of iap's ruining a game. Don't download. EA is just greedy.,1
"I want to like this take on the Clash of Clans genre. Unfortunately, I can't progress because I'm loathe to buy gems, which dramatically impedes my ability to progress - - I can't upgrade or build a single thing without days of resource gathering. Meanwhile, the players who do pay for gems can speed on up the ranks and quickly amass the best forces and defenses, further impeding my ability to progress.   I'll be keeping an eye on this game, hoping it becomes less of a pay-to-win affair.",2
Its basically a scam,1
"It's getting very redundant that these new games are set up to where you need to buy ""gems"" to advance or survive in the game.  I would rather pay a one time price, rather than having to buy currency",1
You could buy an entirely new game with this kind of money. What were they thinking? Is this a scam?,1
Too many iap,1
45m:n and still can get out the Gd tutorial......  way to ruin it.,1
"Seriously, even worse then the new star trek movies",1
"After 10 mins it became a disaster where ""free"" isn't really free and you just feel like playing this game is a cheap excuse to try and pry money out of you. No thanks. Will never pay money for blatant ""free"" cash-grab games. And the fact this is called ""Dungeon Keeper"" makes it even more insulting.",1
The amount of in app purchases required to play this game is ridiculous. I would rather just pay 10 dollars to play the original on my computer.,1
Pay to play and obscenely expensive at that. they could have released the original without updating the graphics and had 5 stars,1
The game is designed to squeeze as much out of you as possible. I have played this game for three days but did not get three days worth of content. The time it takes to mine out anything is ridiculous. Don't buy unless you want to get Nickle and dimed to bankruptcy.,1
EA I knew you were terrible but this is a new low,1
"Very little content.  Looks pretty for about 5 mins, then stops being a game and becomes a boring/frustrating job.",1
"Congratulations EA for destroying one of the best games ko ever. The classic Dungeon Keeper was one of a kind and EA could have made more money if they kept the original idea behind the game and actually made a Dungeon Keeper 3, but nope they had to destroy it completely by making it into ANOTHER time game. Any existing faith I had in EA is gone. You lazy f***s could easily made this a successful series and still could if you would only get your heads out of your a**es. Look at the reviews EA everybody wants the old one back, hopefully this is a wake up call and a revival of a legendary game.",1
It's sad to see that this is what has happened to Dungeon Keeper. The orginal was a revolutionary game that was that was actually fun to play. Not this pay to play crap. Instead of downloading this you should go to good old games and download DK 1 or 2. You will get more bang for your buck and you will actually enjoy yourself.,1
They made this game so you have to wait DAYS to progress unless you spend a LOT of money to buy jems costing up to $100!!! Yet another amazing game series ruined by EA,1
,1
"One of my faves.  Update 2/6/14: not having played this version before, I didn't know the controls or the difficulty in getting gems. Once the tutorial is over, you're on your own - I've been playing for... 3 days? I can't afford more imps to do my bidding because I spent my gems on things to see what they were & what they'd do. I'm sitting here looking at my imps dig.   And you can't reset or start a new game. Unless you start a new GOOGLE account. Or spend $$ to buy gems. Or  uninstall.  Pretty poopy, EA.",2
"This is a very crappy game, if you refuse to pay you,re  badly gimping yourself! Dont fall into that trap",1
Money mongols,1
This type of pay to play is a plague.,1
I am a long time game player... Played both Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2.  Waited 10 years for this piece of trash.  EA can really ruin a game legacy.,1
"Boycott EA! Vote with your dollars! EA has ruined or cancelled and run my favorite devs out of business, what they replace our beloved IPs with is GARBAGE!",1
Only downloaded to give it one star will be uninstalling immediately.,1
"The app has a screen (see Eurogamer's article) that invites you to rate it... but if you say anything other than 5/5 it takes you to a ""feedback"" screen rather than the Play page to rate it. So the scores are completely skewed in favor of people who said they'd rate it 5/5. By comparison the user review rating for this game on Metacritic is 0.2 out of 10. And for good reason, see some of the other reviews discussing the microtransaction greed that ruins this potentially good title.",1
"I was excited when I saw that DK would install and run on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It looked great, but nothing works.  It loads, but it just sits there while I go nuts trying to click on anything to make it work.  The only thing I have been able to get it to do is load and close.  Oh well, I can only hope it will do a clean uninstall.",1
Can't win unless you shell out a lot of cash.,1
This game is just a cash grab for EA.....,1
I would of love to pay for the core game upfront. Hell i might of paid 20 bucks. Then could've done expansion..,1
Looks great but game freezes and turns off my tablet cant even get past tutorial. Otherwise looks good.,2
,2
In-app purchases are extortion of the stupid.,1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Horrible microtransaction model.,1
Why would u remake a dos game. Then have it turn out to be crap.  the original DK and DK2 way better plus they are FREE!,1
"The in app rating forces 5 stars, you can't give it less than 5 stars unless you go to the play store to rate it. I installed it JUST to give it a 1 star to negate someones forced 5 star review.",1
Took a great game and trashed it,1
So bad I can actually smell poop.,1
Games like this ruin mobile gaming. Playing this free is like watching paint dry.,1
See the stories on the internet how they are hiding their poor ratings. The score here doesn't reflect the real feelings about the game.,1
I used to love this game. I would have gladly paid for an unlocked version of this game rather than play this free tap and wait crap.,1
"I would gladly pay $5 for an unbroken version of this game.  Unfortunately, ea wants ridiculous amounts of money to make the game playable.  No thanks.",1
It takes 1 day to dig 1 tile.  $8 for first imp and the cost goes up for each one.  Have fun waiting at least 5 minutes every time you summon units.  Just about everything has a pointlessly long timer attached to it.  Who would play this?  Why is it so hard for EA to understand that all we want is a proper Dungeon Keeper game?,1
this app forces you to pay for your spending several weeks to dig out a couple of blocks. Avoid this blasphemous tragedy at all costs.,1
,2
"Not unique anymore, just a copy of all the other phone castle builders.",1
"Original DK was a really fun game, this is a watered down, pay-to-win copy. Not worth it.",1
This game is an example of everything that is wrong with gaming these days. The whole micro transaction greed needs to stop. EA you are just alienating the people who made game series like dungeon keeper popular in the first place.,1
,1
I get through part of the tutorial and when i get to naming my dungeon my keys dont show up. This is nuts i remember playing this when i was young and now i cant even continue cuz i cant name my dungeon this is stupid!,1
"Basically one giant cashgrab, if the timers weren't so long and the upgrades didn't require eventual money purchases MAYBE it could be called free to play.  Also, it's now known that EA is funneling reviews that are less than 5 stars from in-app to an email address rather than including them in this score rating. That means the displayed 4.5 rating is SUPER bogus at this point. I'd estimate this app really comes in around 2-3 stars at MOST knowing the backlash it's facing from the general gaming community.",1
"Reminded me so much of the fun I had with the original game, but the ridiculous wait to accomplish anything along with the ""Pay us to finish at a reasonable speed"" was just too much.",1
This compete bs.,1
"What garbarge.  But it's EA, so that's to be expected.",1
The game won't let you continue playing unless you pay. This is a SCAM! EA has to stop this practice. They are literally stealing people's money. How can the game come to a complete halt unless I pay? This is bullsh*t.,1
"First, 1star because the game tries to trick you into rating no less than 5, which is why I suspect most others would rate lowly as well. The level of IAP in this is insane. If this was a $20 game without IAP b\s I'd buy it, but as usual greed has ruined another beloved franchise.",1
The only reason I downloaded this game was to rate it at 1 star because EA tries to trick people into rating it 5 stars. I may change my rating if it turns out to be a decent game.,1
"I really want to play this game and  would even have paid a couple dollars from the start.  The micro-transactions are so limiting and provide no benefit, except to EA.",1
So shady.,2
Its great,5
Free? Lolol,1
,1
Excellent entertainment.,3
"Free to play is a joke and cynical BS like this is ruining gaming everywhere lately. And the prompt to intercept less-than-5 star reviews and divert them away from Google Play is scummy, disingenuous, and should get this ""game"" booted from Google Play.",1
Not only has EA ruined a great franchise but they've done so by copying another game developer's title. Just go download Clash of Clans instead.,1
"It doesn't play like the originals and it has a terrible pay-wall. On top of that, they're trying to force people to give it a 5 star rating in-game while not allowing you to give it anything below in order to corrupt the play store ratings.",1
"Meh, old idea, New coat of paint, are you surprised with an EA game?  Cough cough Madden cough.",1
Don't even bother,1
EA clearly doesn't care nearly as much about making a playable game as they do about making money in microtransactions.,1
"This game is a total scam. In-app purchases are a rip-off. Gameplay is ridiculously slow if you don't spend money. Even when you spend money, it's slow.   EA has taken a great PC game (which you can purchase cheap and no problems with the gameplay) and monetized it.   They should be removed from the Play Store for gaming the reviews. You cannot do an in-game review for less than 5 stars. This is gaming the system.  Google - PULL THIS GAME FROM THE STORE.",1
Mining hard ore takes 24 hours,1
It's just like the one from my childhood... Oh wait that's what I wanted. I actually got a cheap crap pay to win game that only lets you do something every hour. Why do you need access to my circle again? Why does it always have to be connected?  Way to ruin another franchise EA. I'd rather pay a few bucks up front for a good game instead of trying rip me off with micro transactions.,1
"The game is great, I don't mind waiting for buildings to be completed but when you can't even connect to the servers to play, that's were I draw the line. Devs, if you fix anything please fix the connection issues. It really is a good game, all waiting and expensive gem purchases aside.",2
And it does a disservice to the original. :(,1
,1
And to make it worse they attempt to censor any rating below 5 starts. Not worth your time.,1
This is a remake of a great game this is pay to play garbage. The original was a game you could sit down and play now you just have to wait to play.,1
The pacing is terrible.  Put out the real game without micro transactions and multi-hour waiting periods (what were you thinking???) and you've got a sale for $10.  The way it is now?  Uninstalled.,1
That's all this game is. And the fact it tries to stop you from Giving it a poor rating is shady as hell. How the mighty have fallen...,1
I wanted to play dungeon keeper. Wow. The freemium content is completely over priced and totally wreck the feel of the game. Getting attacked offline and losing resources sucks. And it is for these reasons I uninstalled what would otherwise be a great game.,1
,1
Just another cheap ea gimmick cashing in on a beloved franchise.,1
No one should encourage this type of pay structure for entertainment. Don't help perpetuate a market where this kind of crap is acceptable.,1
This game is definitely a pay-and-wait game. Do NOT play this if you have any sense. A disgrace to the original franchise.,1
"Well, what should I have expected from an EA F2P game...",1
"Has potential, but requires you to spend money to get anything done. Barely playable without forking over cash. Disappointing.",1
"Its sad to see this cash grab from EA, attempting to garner money from people a few dollars at a time for gems. I would have paid $2-5 for a full version of this game instead of a pay-to-win / free-to-wait model that is well known in Zynga games. I would expect this in a Facebook game.  Actions (which should be instant) take days. Purposefully increased to make you have to purchase gems with real money in order to make any real progress.  Make a $5 version of this game with unlimited gems. The problem with that? Everything is instant and you can destroy every enemy on screen with the press of a button. It removes all elements of difficulty from the game. When this happens, when your gems are too powerful and your game progress too slow, you have a pay-to-win model for your games.  Do not download this and waste your time.",1
Very bad lame knock off. Way to not be creative and have an imagination.,1
Either this is a blatant way to take advantage of original DK enthusiasm or someone royally screwed up some basic algorithms. Free to play games are generally still fun while progressing is still possible... microtransactions are in place to enrich the experience...  BUT THIS GAME IS OPPOSITE OF THAT. without some very expensive microtransactions it's nearly impossible  to advance. Even digging out your own dungeon is ridiculously slow...  Unless you want to pay of course.,2
"EA trying to scam users out of money with ""free-to-play"" garbage. Do not install.",1
"No support for S-Pen stylus. Lost all progress by checking notifications. Silly, greedy, outdated $ model where you take a game, decent or otherwise, and slow it down beyond tolerance unless the -idiot- customer pays real money. Please address the above, this game has potential.",2
"Building a dungeon is fun. placement of traps, hallways and rooms allows for a variety of strategic options. No real pressure to spend money. Fun way to pass time.",5
Ok,5
Makes flappy bird look like a 10/10 GOTY,1
,1
So typical of EA. It's quite obvious that they loathe their customers.,1
,1
"The wait walls and need to CONSTANTLY give this game money to play are the worst I have ever seen.  The reward system is so broken, that raiding without paying for the weekly +40% buff is a break-even or money loosing proposition most of the time.  24 hours to break one tile? Seriously?  Upgrading a single room takes... 3 days?!  Fing Joke.  I would have gladly paid $50 for a Dungeon Keeper that was playable.  Mythic as a huge fan of the original DAoC, it breaks my heart to see what EA has turned you into.  You screwed up Warhammer to the point that Games Workshop yanked your license.. and now... you have taken a giant dump on another one of gaming's classic.  If I could rate this trash less than 1 star I would.",1
I had great memories growing up playing DK now they want me to throw all my money into an app that took all the cool things from DK away and added some crappy ones :( sad....,1
Thank you for running another game just like plants vs zombies. Are you afraid of the other dungeon keeper game coming out this year. Dungeon keeper 3 we were promised. I miss bullfrog glad the is a company that will make dungeon keeper right.,1
"The ""Pay2Dig"" way Dungeon Keeper is set up shows how out of touch EA is with the gaming community. What a way to throw a beloved franchise in the mud and stomp on it for your own corporate interests.  Disgusting. Worst company in America.",1
Clash of Clans 2.0! Only 4x the price and half the fun. What a waste. Can't wait til they release the dlc.,1
Take a brilliant God game and convert it into a replica of FarmVille?  Mission  accomplished!,1
Shame on EA. This game is a joke and the manipulative marketing should get this booted from the play store,1
,1
Game requires purchases to play near rate of original (90s) game.,1
"The amount of greed blatantly on display in this game is appalling. Riding the coattails of nostalgia and a once well-deserved popular game, it's cringe-inducing just to look at it. Hopefully the poor programmers that designed it didn't cry too hard at night.",1
"Sadly this game is a bastardization of  DK franchise. Not only can you not hold down your units like in the original, but also they give you timers on buildings blocks, and guess what?. It takes one hour to destroy gold walls. When in DK it took only 1 to 5 mins. This truly is the worst of the worst EA has done. It's like they didn't even try making a Dungeon Keeper game.",1
"The blatant pay-to-play model utilized here is disgusting.  If this game instead was a one time payment up front this seems like it might work, but with the severe payments that are essentially required to progress it's not worth the time.  Uninstalling.  In addition the manipulative way the game tries to deter you from leaving anything less than a five star review is incredibly shady.  EA should be ashamed of themselves.",1
Do not play this if you dont want to spend upwards of a 100 dollars for couple of hours of terrible gameplay,1
Its all about micro transactions.,1
,1
"The game is fun up until you get your dungeon to level four or so, but it becomes impossible to stock pile without constant raids unless you buy gems which of course cost money. So free is misleading and I'd rather see an ad supported version than the ridiculous gems. Don't get involved! UPDATE: 400 of my gems magically disappeared within 12 hours after this review was posted. Uninstalled!",1
I was excited when I first saw a mobile dungeon keeper game as I played the PC version quite a bit. It didn't take long before I realized EA replaced the fun with their endless greed. Not possible to do anything beyond starting the game without sinking more money than any reasonable person would spend on any mobile platform. After what they did to this beloved game I'll probably never download another EA game again.,1
"I have a Huawei Assend and the game won't even start, right when it gets started out crashes fix and I will play and rate 5",1
,1
"This isn't even a game. It's a poor excuse for anything and really shows the true, ugly colors of EA.",1
This game takes this amazing IP into the dumpster.,1
not a fan of the 'pay to expedite',1
Pay to play is an abomination and this game takes the cake.  Terrible money boundaries where it is impossible to move on at any fun pace with out paying huge amounts of money.  Why have companies begun to do this?   Do they not care enough about their reputation?   All that matters is the extra dollars.  I would've glady paid up front for this game with no pay per play features.   Then at least it might have been fun.,1
"It's like EL got jealous of clash of clans and wanted to get in on that piggy bank. That would be all fine and dandy I'd they actually attempted to make it BETTER, instead of worse and more expensive to keep up.",1
suck game. Se frisa mucho,1
"It's so disheartening seeing one of my childhood favorites ruined in this way.  The original was such a breakthrough game, to see it reduced to this pay to win, money sucking business model is a huge let-down. I installed it just to leave a review.  Will uninstall immediately, I can't bear to experience this disappointment.",1
"The F2P model has ruined this game.  They also employ shadow patterns to subvert less than 5-star reviews away from Google Play, instead redirecting you to a form to submit to EA.  That alone deserves a 1-Star review, making the rating of this game overall suspect.",1
"Welcome home keeper. It's been awhile, and we really let the place go to hell. Real-time gameplay may be fun, but it's not profitable enough for our current business model. Instead, we've set up a slot where you can insert a dollar every time you want to play for a few minutes. I know it's horrible, but this looks much better in our books, and isn't that what making games is all about?",1
"I'm sure there's a lot of fun to be had but after ""playing"" for seven hours as my imps slowly whittled away at the six hour to break gold blocks then started two gem blocks, I just couldn't justify a game that I would assign two blocks to be broken then wait for a day.",1
This game is an expensive poorly made game. I have restarted the game 3 times after playing for awhile the game crashes or looses its connection and nothing saves. The game itself is a cheap sellout. To do anything fast you gotta shell out cash! Even to buy more than 1 imp!! I LOVED this game as a kid WHAT HAVE YOU DONE EA??!!??!!?!,1
I was a huge fan of the original DK & DK2 and really wanted to love this game but as usual EA found a way to ruin things. The play mechanism is terrible and centered on spending money to succeed. Even the raid system makes no sense and is geared towards losing resources so you hopefully buy more.,1
Buggy and a poor money grab.,1
The micro transactions really take away from the game. I would much rather just pay $5 or $10 to have the entire game unlocked without the ridicules wait 9 hours to complete farmville crap.,1
Hey Ea instead charging an arm and leg remake the original for the puter and you will probably make more money!,4
Micro transactions everywhere...  Avoid this game at all costs.,1
"Worst excuse to scam people for money I have ever seen in a game-like package. There is no fun, no excitement, nothing from the original awesome PC title... Just usual EA garbage that even cheats in disallowing you from rating the game a 0 stars it surely deserves.",1
"I haven't seen anything like this in my life. EA is making a game where you have to pay to win, and on top of that they are forcing you to rate 5 stars if you use the in game popup",1
I would have loved to have paid 5$ for a great game instead of getting a game loaded with microtransactions I will never pay for. EA I joke you're happy from today on I will never download a game from you if it has microtransactions in it.,1
I believe I've said enough.,1
,4
"Free to play, seemingly pay to win. It has a fun concept and interesting characters but... it would take the two starter minions about eight days to dig out all the mines. And while you dig you can't do any building. Unless you buy who knows how many gems that cost real money to dig/(insert time delayed action here) almost instantly.",2
Thanks for ruining another franchise for us. RIP Bullfrog.,1
Super fun and addicting game! Great job EA!!!!!!,5
,3
"They're worst company that  has ever existed. Google the scandal that is brewing regarding this app's rating system. It's atrocious. Google should remove this app from the store, and all EA apps from the App Store.",1
,5
"The only way to advance in the game is through money...there is absolutely no skill or thought involved.  Also, I dont see many 5 star votes in the reviews...not sure where the total review numbers are coming from?",1
Horrible aberration of the Dungeon Keeper IP. Not a game - you are treated like a money pinata.,1
This game was great when it was first released. Then EA adds in their micro transactions at every turn to make a cheap buck and it ruins it. Worst of all they are sidestepping poor reviews through the app. Shady business EA. What happened to just making quality products for your customers in order to provide something great that we want to come back to? Instead you're nickel and diming us every chance you get.,1
I own the original Dungeon Keeper games and this is just a shame either outright charge for the game for people to play. Or be up front about the fact its a pay as you go game. Oh the fact you have hidden how you can submit a review in app is priceless EA.,1
This game could be so much fun if EA wasn't trying to bend me over and butt rape me and take all my money. Let's face it... If you don't spend the money it would take forever to het anywhere. Shame on you EA!,2
With harder tiles taking up to 24 hours to break what is the point... I was hoping for better with this game shame on you EA... Like you don't make enough money... Guess it is time to go back to my computer and play DRM free version from GOG,1
"Don't be fooled by the 5-star reviews. EA is giving away game money for reviews.   Everything you do requires you to upgrade which takes time. You can save time by spending currency which you can get in game. When you run out and you will quickly, you can buy now, but it is very expensive.  The game play is not very exciting either. It looks really nice and it's very polished, but ultimately it's just a bad game.",1
,1
What a pile.,1
"Unless you want to dump a bunch of money into this 'free' game, don't waste your time.",1
"This game could be really good but, no exaggeration, you would have to spend $50 or more on in app purchases to make it playable, huge rip-off, greedy pigs",1
"ugh, i just don't even know where to start with this.   i loved the fact that it was a dungeon keeper game. i thought i could play something akin to what i used to play on the PC. and free? i'll take it!  but it's one of those awful free to play style games where you're really penalized unless you shell out cash. and then i found out EA was involved and i made so many eyerolls i could have opened a bakery. and then that interview where the developers were talking out the sides of their mouths and talking about how good the reviews are? please, the whole system is set up so you can only give it 5 stars within the app. i had to come directly to the play page, reinstall the app on my Mac (it was initially on my phone) just to actually give it a poor review. talk about deception. there's something really wrong here.   i'm sure there's a demographic that loves this kind of game, mainly children and teenagers, or people that fall for ""Nigerian Prince"" emails. i'm also sure that investors and people who believe what disinformation big companies like EA shell out, and in those cases, i feel sorry for their lots and hope they figure out how babby is formed.",1
Took a wonderful old game and turned it into nothing but an ATM machine. You're microed to death. Good luck playing with out paying.,1
Cynical and exploitative payment system. Terrible treatment of a gaming classic.,1
,1
EA ruins another series. GG EA.,1
Money hungry EA at it again.,1
"So, let me walk you through the first few minutes of this game. You get asked to do something and then told to spend gems to make it go fast. That is repeated throughout the entire tutorial.  ""do this thing, and use your gems liberally."" Of course, what they are really training you to do is spend gems, which cost real money. So no EA. No.  Just do yourself a favor and read the reviews an note how 90% of the reviews that actually talk about the game are one or two stars.",1
"Terrible game. The original was fun, clever and cheeky, this is a sad, bald grab for money. Shame on you, EA",1
I would much rather buy an unlocked game.,1
I was a big fan of the PC version so I gave this a try. Game wants you to buy currency in order to get anywhere... Total waste of time.,1
It's something very different from those games,1
,1
,1
Basically IAPs with DRM.,1
bad,1
Super fun to play!,5
MICRO TRANSACTIONS EVERYWHERE. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL DUNGEON KEEPER. ITS ALL PAY TO WIN. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.,1
"Wait times are too long everything steers you in the direction of failure if you can't cough up ""too much"" coin I understand free to play ethics but it seems like ea is more concerned with making d fast cash instead of making a good enjoyable game a slap in the face to the gaming community",1
"With the time management fail ""feature"" to slowly gather materials over a period of hours(or possibly longer if you can't access the game every 5 min) this game does not do the past PC versions any justice. Combined with no option to opt out of the multiplayer, I can not suggest anyone waste their time with this game.",1
Nothing new here. Same as several games i have already played. I didnt care for the ui and the traps are small and dont feel like traps when placed,1
"i'd give this a 2.5 stars if i could. it's DUNGEON KEEPER. I've been waiting months for this game to be released for andriod. original dungeon keeper and the sequel came out YEARS ago before mobile games were a thing, for people calling this a clash of clans clone.   I was hoping they were going to charge 5~15 dollars for a full game and not as a free to play microtransaction. I've been playing Dungeon Overlord to get my dungeon keeper fix and its a game that takes weeks to make progress in. I throw up Dungeon Keeper 2 i bought at good old games while i'm waiting for Overlord.  TL;DR I'm happy a new Dungeon Keeper has been released after 15 years since the last one, but sad it's a wait or play game.",3
"Surprisingly addictive, considering there really isn't that much to do. A good time filler, not a great strategy title like its forebears.",3
Clone of so many other games. Pay tons of money to do nothing. Makes EA look worse than they already do.,1
Two minutes game play a day. Don't make me laugh ea. Enjoy your third year as worst company.,1
This game is one of the worst F2P titles I've seen. Just more proof that EA cares more about profits than players.,1
They don't let you give below 5 stars when the popup shows up.,1
The game asks you to review it but sends low score to a private webpage.,1
"Unless you feel like shelling out cash all day to do anything worthwhile, avoid this pile of garbage.",1
"Keeps me busy during class and when I have down town, very macro heavy I thoroughly enjoy this game 10/10 would recommend to a friend",5
"This is a clash of clan competitor plain and simple. Knowing that, DK does do a lot of things well and has a lot of charm and personality. Not bug free though. One in particular that is really annoying is that sometimes you will 100% beat an enemy dungeon or campaign level but only be awarded 99% and thus 2 out of three star rating.Good game if you have a ton of patience or money to spend.",3
A poor use of the IP that is riddled with microtransactions that slow the game down artificially and frustrate the player.,1
Most of the 5 stars are from deceptive rating gathering present in the app.,1
"Having to wait 24 hours, or pay a fee is not an acceptable gameplay strategy.",1
"Ruins a wonderful IP. I had such high hopes, I've often wished for them to revisit this franchise and they finally do only for it to be worse than anything Zynga ever did.  FOR SHAME EA.",1
"I still have my cd-roms for the real games. I actually have 2 installed on a computer that easily runs any modern game. You know what? I'd rather play low resolution on a desktop than be harrassed to keep buying game items. I was giving it due trial period, but when I levelled up my dungeon heart and they tried to sell me ""premium""? Well, I'm done now. Uninstalling.",1
"No semblance of the original remains. Replaced with money grubbing free-to-play garbage. Even discourages negative reviews from making it to the store, allowing only 5 star through the app.",1
In order to accomplish nearly anything it takes either a very long time or lots of $$.,1
Took too long to load and then threw pay to pay aspects in my face,1
,1
Too many microtransactions to adequately enjoy the game.,1
,1
Screw this game. You can't play without paying a ton and they cheat the play store review system by directing reviews from the game itself. Install and down rate this garbage.,1
"Immediately you're hit with paying to advance. Game does look like the old dungeon keeper games, but is nothing but a money sink. This is barely a game.",1
,5
Great game ruined by greedy. You suck EA for your terrible tactics to squeeze money out of folks.,1
Fyi...this was before clash of clans this was a pc game 12 years ago.,3
You can only play this game with the microtransactions and they are ludicrously pricey,1
Why did you have to ruin a classic with this pay to play bs... Why is this game type such a hit? God I hate my generation...,1
,1
I would only recommend this game to people who enjoy playing (and losing at) slot machines.,1
Free to play? Try pay to play. Bull crap.,1
1-4 reviews takes you to a fake site? 5 stars here? EA are a bunch of scam-artists.,1
,1
Do not waste your time or money with this game. EA has done so much wrong by the dungeon keeper name,1
,1
"Between always on DRM, a misleading request for reviews (the in game request only lets you review if you say you'll give five stars), and poor responses to criticism,  Dungeon Keeper didn't seem promising.  Getting into the game only makes it worse. Poor interface,  poor tutorial, and bad, boring jokes.  Poor showing overall.",1
"Fun for about a day, or until you realize that your house has been mortgaged in order to pay for your awesome dungeon that countless gems have built.  UNINSTALLED  .",1
Can't believe this pay to play garbage.,1
"The tutorial was interesting and held my interest for the first ten minutes, but once I started working on my own dungeon, imps started requiring *four hours* to excavate a single block. Excavation is the most basic element of Dungeon Keeper and they want you to pay excavate each block. Uninstalled.  TL;DR: Don't waste time and bandwidth on this version of Dungeon Keeper. Another developer will create a better version of this game that captures the spirit of the original game soon.",1
"Crappy crappy crappy, you have to wait 24 hours for a lot blocks to unlock themselves?!?!?!   Talk about greedy, and a complete insult on the IP.",1
"Awful remake of a treasured classic, EA should be ashamed of putting this out.",1
"I don't mind paying $1-$2 bucks to support a good game, but $10-$100 is a joke. It was interesting at first because building didn't take that long. The time curve on upgrades becomes very steep, forcing one to put the game down & come back later. Makes the game become unplayable quickly.",1
Not interested in spending that much money to play a game.,1
Dk2 was amazing....wish these guys didn't use pay to wait system...would have been amazing.,1
"Forces you to play online. Almost mandatory to sign in to social networking... bugs you for sign-in every time and the game is designed for tamagotchi style maintenance, so really annoying. I finally relented and it wiped my saved data. Now I'm back in the tutorial but its bugged and won't let me proceed. No option to reset. If you like waiting in line, wasting time on hold, or pouring money down the drain, this game is for you! I assume most 5 star ratings are from the prompt before you hit the gem wall.",2
Completely strips everything you loved about the original Dungeon Keeper then mounts pay to play on it. This reminds me of the South Park episode where G. Lucas is raping Indiana Jones. Except it's EA executives and Horny.,1
,1
"This game pretty much will not do anything without constantly dumping money in it.  The reviews here are manipulated, it will not forward you to the play store if you want to give it less than five stars.  I would have bought this if you could get a real game for a one-time fee but it is asking for far too much for far too little.",1
Simply terrible. Does not need to exist as a game as it is just Clash of the IAP Clans with a Dungeon Keeper skin. Sad to see this disgusting piece of software be labelled as Dungeon Keeper.,1
The game needs to be always have online and when it does connect you loose all our progress on a campaign.,1
Beast,3
Way to take an amazing game and ruin it! Too much pay to win!,1
"In the end, you have to pay.",1
"No respect.  Take your 1 star, you earned it.",1
"I cannot believe they go to these lengths to ruin the game play, what the hell.",1
makes you pay to play more than 5 minutes a day and tries to trick people into giving 5 star ratings,1
,1
EA has turned a classic game into a game where it requires significant amount of money to advance anywhere efficiently.,1
"Just like clash of clans. Either you pay or take day waiting for the simplest task. If you have played the original don't play this. It is something that ruins the name. On the good side good graphics, smooth gameplay, and battles are kinda fun.",2
"Game seems cool, but it turns into a joke when progress stops until you start paying EA a never ending stream of money.  I have no idea how they got so many 5 star ratings.   I wouldn't be surprised if the game eventually offers bunch of gems if you lie and give the game a great review.",1
This is just another terrible pay to wait game.,1
Could be fun. But it would cost too much money.,1
There really is no point in playing this unless you like waiting or paying a crap ton of real money just to continue. The game is set up where it is frustratingly hard unless you give in and pay. This is a horrible game model,1
"After realizing this isn't going to be a fun little ""while on the train to work"" and rather more of a pay for fun model, I uninstalled. Nothing like the wonderful original, I'd pay money for that.",1
The game brings back memories but its not the same as the original Dungeon Keeper by Bullfrog. If my CD ROM still worked for my computer have definitely reinstall it.,1
24 hour wait on a move if I don't buy gems is absurd.,1
IAP ruin this game.  Why do people continue to accept mobile cash grabs.,1
Your progression is managed so tightly it feels like you are on rails playing this game. Everything has been optimized to force the player to spend money. Fun is secondary.,1
Not sure how destroying people's childhoods with IAP crap is supposed to help EA live down back to back worst company in america awards but best of luck to them.,1
"How date this be considered a game. Way to ruin a great game series, death of Dungeon Keeper right here... If I could I'd give it zero stars.",1
"Takes to long to do anything.  Not about to be IAP into the poorhouse either.  I would gladly have bought a full version, this is unacceptable.",2
It's a blatant cash in on a beloved series devoid of any real gameplay. They also employ a terrible trick in the ratings screen to trick people into not rating the app if it's less than 5 stars.,1
Disgrace to the original games....,1
I'm sad for those who have rated 5 star this game.. gaming is supposed to be fun but all those micro transaction s OMG,1
"I decided not to read the comments until I played the game. At the end, I think this is boring. Just follow the instructions and you can quickly proceed thru the game. Did not see anything exciting. Of course pay to pay is only good when then game is good. In this case, i would not spent 1c on it.",1
nt,1
Why do we have to pay for more minions?,1
Would have given negative stars if possible. Just downloaded w/ update and it won't let me name my dungeon or go past that part of into.,1
This game is a revolting abomination and blatant bunging up of a wonderful original title and classic game. Pay to play is absolutely disgusting in this cheap tower defense knockoff. Stay clear.,1
I would pay a fixed $5 for a mobile game that is similar to the pc version of dungeon keeper but this game is loaded with micro transactions.  Can't do anything without paying out the nose.  Horrible! Don't be tricked.,1
"If this is any indication of where the video game industry is heading with F2P, then our future is looking grim.",1
This is another in a long line of ruined games.,1
The cancer of pay-to-play has also spread to this classic. Uninstalled in the first give minutes.,1
This game is crap. The dungeon isn't big enough and you have to spend too much real money to do anything. Do not buy. Get something else.,1
Make a better app please.,1
DISAPPOINTED.,1
$99 to play for a week?,1
"Just a rip off of so many other waste of time and money games. Its dungeon keeper in name only, very disappointing.",1
This game is just terrible.  No surprise it's a EA game.,1
Rather spend 20 bucks and buy the full version on steam.,2
This game sucks.  What a scam ea is.,1
Boooo,1
EA should be embarassed. Uninstalling after leaving review,1
This isn't a game so much as a begging machine designed to also rape my nostalgia of a beloved franchise. Couldn't give this fewer stars.,1
"Should be called pay to play, not free to play",1
"It looks like it might be fun but the always on requirement for the network means that it uses expensive data and doesn't actually play where you want to play. I cannot, for instance, play the game while on the train or in the car because even switching from 4G to WiFi causes the game to kick the player out to the menu. Additionally losing signal entirely means that the game stops responding (except to exit) with no indication that network connectivity is the problem.",1
It won't start up,1
"This game brought back fine memories of playing the original game from the nineties. Unfortunately, microtransactions are necessary to get anything done practically. Actions that used to take seconds in thr old game instead take hours, unless you pay with gems bought with real money. This game broke my heart.",1
EA has taken great IP and ruined it. Very disappointed in this game. You have to pay to do everything. This game will cost you lots of money.,1
The mico-transaction is deep. Like 1$ to get rid of dirt or wait 4 hours. Bu t thats EA. If your very active its no big as you can get 30 min boost free at any time. Not a bad game but  if you're prone to spend $$$ on F2P. I say pick other game it very steep here.,3
"To all who may call this a clone, dungeon keeper Do your research game has been around since the 90s",4
Im still waiting for C&C mobile.,4
Were is the live wallpaper I got the ringtone but not the live wallpaper???,4
,1
"Wow, EA, way to take a fantastic game and turn it into pay-to-win garbage. Also, deceptive begging for stars in-game keeps the rating artificially high.",1
"This is not a game, this is not dungeon keeper, this is free to wait pay to play garbage,this is a pile of excrement that the developers dropped in your hands and expect you to pay for because they said so. This is an insult to customers and games everywhere. Don't waste a cent on this abomination don't even download it for the false promise of a dungeon keeper game like I did. Save yourselves now leave this page and never return.",1
,1
I haven't been able to play this game one. Due to the need to be connected to the internet that is not fire walled. In one word useless.,1
"Microtransactions are rarely good, but at least the ones in Clash of Clans are low cost, this is just a bad, more expensive clone. Doesn't help that EA is blocking undesirable ratings to inflate the score",1
First couple of levels are fun.  After that. In app purchases cripple the game.,1
Bombarded with microtransactions. Everything in the game quickly progresses to taking hours to complete tasks ... gets very boring very quick when you can't do anything until your upgrades complete and they take 4+ hours.,1
It's almost impossible to do anything without spending money,1
this game is impossible without spending money.  DO NOT download this until they fix the economic mechanics of the game.,1
EA sucks dics,1
,1
"""Freemium"" type games are the worst.",1
This game is either boring or expensive. Take your pick.,1
Not free to play like they claim,1
,1
"Love the old DK, this isn't it.",1
"Very lack luster game for all these micro transactions. Foul play by ea in only directing you to the google review section if you say you're giving 5 stars, otherwise they have you do an inside ea review.",1
Dk used to be good. Ea ruined with this dud.,1
"so to start for free to play game to have always on Drm is absurd, this needs to go. second the pay well here is really high it is hard to advance in the game without shelling out money.",1
,1
Bad.,1
"EA once again takes something people held in high regards, and finds a way to handicap it with micro-transactions. This isn't   ""free-to-play"", this is a ""pay-to-have-fun"" bastardization of a great game someone else once created. Thanks for nothing EA....",1
"EA continues its disgusting trends for pay-to-play free-to-play games. It is a shameless ripoff of other games but with predatory gameplay that aims to have people put a money fire out with more of their money. Video game hell is a real thing and these developer monsters will be caged in the worst part of it. Don't support this garbage, it makes video games bad and encourages EA to walk the path of evil further and further",1
Absolute garbage,1
,1
You either pay or wait ridiculous amount of time,1
"Thanks for ruining a great game from my childhood.  This is a stone cold murder of dungeon keeper, mobile gaming, and the entire free to play genre.",1
"I could never play the game. Always checking for updates but nothing downloads. Tried on wifi and cell network, same thing. Left it for about 20 minutes checking for updates... Still no updates but keeps checking.",1
Awful,1
I love dungeon keeper. This isn't really dungeon keeper more of a dungeon keeper themed clash of the clans but I still love it.,5
"Let me pay once, I don't want to wait while playing.",1
"Really great IP, very poor design. Insane pay walls to do any thing fun. Nothing rewarding or interesting about this game. I tried it for a day and uninstalled it the next day. Don't encourage this type of design and play something else.",1
"If you ever played the original dungeon keeper, do not download this. Avoid the heartbreak. This is a terribly watered down pay to play nightmare. It looks like they know the sounds and characters but never got the point. Even worse, we all know EA doesn't care.",1
"In game transaction hell.   You are forced to use in game currency during the tutorial, WTF!??@?",1
"EA has perfected the money-making scheme. I'm never buying an EA game again because their stuff is depressingly bad. Save yourself of the despair and never get this ""game"" or anything EA produces again. You'd be better off with polio.",1
game has blocks thst take over 24 hours to dig out... such a massive waste of time not worth playing at all,1
Funnels all 1-4 star reviews away from Google play?,1
"If you really want to try this game, do yourself a favor and buy 25$ in ""gems"" to unlock extra workers from the beginning. Earning them in game is weeks of grinding.  95% of this is a very slow base-building game, shamelessly powered by microtransactions. The attack and defense sections are better, but you are still at the mercy of players willing to pay more to win. Worst of all, the pay to play model only gets more expensive as you level up.",1
"Definitely reminded me of the original DK, but EA ruined it with micro transactions.",1
Terrible.,1
"they took the dungeon keeper name, threw it onto moblie platforms, and added in all the worst free to play gimmicks.",1
EA took an amazing IP and turned it into a pile of garbage.  How are people giving this trash 5 stars. I can't stand mobile games because people find it acceptable to spend hundreds of dollars on such a broken p2w game.,1
The game had so much potential coming from such a great IP but the fact that EA decided it would be a good idea to charge you money if you intend to play the game for more than 5min at a time is truly depressing.   horrible game practice by EA ruined a great game,1
This business model is obnoxious and they ruined a perfectly good franchise by using it . I hope people stop supporting this nonsense.,1
,1
Click to click later,1
Free to wait. Free to look. Dump excessive amounts of cash to win. Any of the aforementioned will describe this game. EA shamelessly abuses the IAP model and designed it to encourage you to funnel your cash into it. It seems gone are the days of paying a lump sum to enjoy a game.,1
I'd gladly pay a few dollars to play this classic but the pay to play model just ruins it.,1
It's a terrible shame that EA has ruined this classic game. I wish I could give this zero stars.,1
This game is so greedy,1
So many micro transactions,1
Updated and now it don't work good job screwing up a good game douches,1
"As a long time Bullfrog fan, this is an abomination. Decent mechanics and visuals marred by a brutal pay-to-wait system that forces you to pour coins into the slot just to dig out rooms. This isn't the first time they've done it, but it's the most egregious example. Vote with your wallet and avoid anything EA.",1
Clone of clash of clans. High pay to play walls.,1
I A P up the @$tr!ck mark! Sorry but Madden was ok. It didn't FORCE IAPs on me... inhibit gameplay... This is ridiculous.,1
:(,1
Any rating under 5 stars that you do in game goes to a issue request instead of submitting it.,1
"You have to pay out of your wallet for it to be playable. And even then, it's not really enjoyable.",1
"Ruined by the same ""wait or pay"" model you'll find in candy crush and other games by greedy developers.  Go enjoy the original Dungeon Keeper for PC and pretend this new awful mobile version never existed.",1
"Pay to wait if you're down for it. I'm not so here's my one star. Its just a clash of clans, with incentives to buy. EA sure ran out of ideas.",1
This is not free to play at all.,1
"This game is not really Dungeon Keeper.  DK is a series where you are the bad / evil keeper luring in good people and heroes to fight.  All you ever fight here is other supposed evil keepers who have your same ""bad guy"" units, at most that would make you neutral.  Even some poor DK clones I've played online still had you angering the people and heroes of the land so they would come in to attack you.  This is more like DK sparring school, you just go against other keepers back and forth over and over.  It totally loses the entire feel of the real DK games.  Even worse is the attempt of the company to manipulate the ratings.  When you play the game asks if you think the game is a 5* game or a 1-4* game.  If you pick 5 it brings you here and asks you to leave a review.  If you pick 1-4 it asks you to send them feedback and does not bring you here to the review page.  Really cheesy way to try to manipulate the ratings guys.  I don't care for Clash of Clans type games and that's what this boils down to, the spirit of DK was lost on whoever made this.  The only thing that sinister here is the way EA tries to manipulate the game's ratings.",2
Ha ha I win.,1
Ive done the tutorial about five times.... Sick of it never saves my game..... game sucks,1
,1
EA never fails to impress with their garbage games. Outrageous payment policy in the game.,1
Micro transactions suck,1
The computer games were awesome. This version sucks a$$! I hate how long it takes to get anything done and how much everything is and how hard it is to dig through the putter crusts of the game. 4hr wait times to dig one piece out??? Wtf are you the dev's thinking? Wrecked it completely for me. Uninstalling it right now. Just sad.  :-(,1
Not allowing people to give the game less than 5 stars from the in-game prompt? Luckily they can't use their sneaky tricks directly in Google Play.,1
"Besides the fact that upgrade requirements keep changing, you need to pay more than a decent console game for what a casual game has in order to just play. Shame on you EA, make DK3 instead of garbage like this! Oh, and they took out that phrase ""no pay to win in this game "" in their description, and if that doesn't raise any alarms for you newbies...",1
"I'll start off with why it gets 1 star.   Always on DRM Pay to Win Rating manipulation Taking a loved franchise and turning it into a casual game  I've loved Dungeon Keeper franchise since the first one came out.  I saw this app and said to myself ""Finally, a new Dungeon Keeper.""  Instead I find a casual game that is only Dungeon Keeper in minor ways.  Then I see it's pay to win which aggravates me even further.  Finally, I try to play when I don't have a net connection and find out that I won't be playing it without one.    It's a fun little app that, in passing, resembles Dungeon Keeper of old.  If you're looking for a casual Dungeon Keeper and have some money to waste on in app purchases, this is the game for you.",1
"Cannot make reasonable progress without sinking a lot of cash into the game.  Also, EA is attempting to manipulate the ratings by only sending users here in game if they say they are going to give it five stars.",1
"How this is considered a game is beyond me. It is just a money trap.  Impire did this better on Steam and even it isn't as good as original DK. Regardless, this is pay to pay garbage.",1
A great lp ruined so EA could pull in money. Unless you're willing to shove out real money to spawn monsters that die near immediately you will have no fun with this. An overly casual micro transation based game thats only called Dungeon Keeper to con people into buying it. Should have been a different game.  Its sad to see EA being rewarded for this poorly made pay to win cash out.,1
"If you play once a day you will prob love this charming game, otherwise the 24 hour timers to do anything will quickly get annoying.",1
This game is a sad attempt to milk the nostalgia of the original game from Bullfrog. You can't really play it unless you constantly pay money with in-game transactions.,1
"For only $99, DK unlocks the next pay tier. Whittle away at your savings for fake in-game gems and creatures!",1
"There's actually a good game hidden inside here, but it's ruined by endless wallet-grabbing. The moment you start to have fun, the game forces you to wait through arbitrary timers (hours). You're encouraged to pay money to keep having fun (shorten the timer), but games are supposed to be fun. That's their fundamental purpose. I would rather give money up front and just play the game as the designers would have it played. Instead, the game is constantly hitting me up for more money like a drug-addicted relative.  So EA, I will give you money--lots of it--after you get out of in-app-purchase rehab. What I won't do is give you money right now because you're just going to blow it on more games like this and you'll be right back with your hand out. You're better than that. I still believe in the ""arts"" part of Electronic Arts and, deep down inside, I know you do too. I love you, but you need to start loving yourself.",1
Disgusting remake of a great game! Really looked forward to starting this game only to be completely and utterly disappointed. Just don't bother with these games. And rate it accordingly.,1
I'm waiting for diabolo games to do this to,5
,1
Pay to play sucks EA has ruined one of my all time favorite franchises.,1
"This game is very racist, sexist, and called me fat.",1
"And ruined another game as expected, the sheer repetitiveness is horrible",1
Ridden with in app purchases. Kills the game,1
Don't waste your time & money with this unless you have too much and feel like donating out to someone who is trying to trick you out of it.  The makers should be ashamed of this game.,1
Absolutely ridiculous pricing model kills the game.,1
The constant need to pay them money to play the game is ridiculous,1
Hate free to play.. this game could have been awesome,3
"I really wanted to love this game like the original and it has the potential. But the fact that it takes a day to mine some of the gem pieces and gives very little in return is frustrating. Sure you can use gems to speed up the process, but it costs about 250 gems to do so. That wouldn't be so bad if the gems themselves were cheaper but as it is right now 4.99 barely gives over 250 gems. Fix the broken microtransaction system and dig times and ill change the rating.",1
,1
How in the world did this get so many 5 star ratings!? I'm not cheap and I do in fact make in app purchases from time to time but how this game implements it is ridiculous. On one hand I can play the game without any in app purchases but the amount of waiting is so bad I get bored and move on to another game. I am not about to make IAP in order to speed up game play. I refuse to do it. I know a good value when I see it... and this is not it. I would gladly pay 9 - 15 dollars for  game of this caliber sans the IAP.,1
Once again EA rises to the occasion and burns down another beloved game title. I was so excited to see this remake only to realize that the only true happiness I would get out of this game would cost me.  Such a let down.  The game hinders progression of anything in a timely manner (unless you pay)  and the companies shady rating system (had to bypass the rating system in-game altogether)  makes this game a pass.,1
"Supposed to be a spiritual successor, but what it is really is taking an old game they knew people would want to play, add microtransactions, and use it as a cash grab. I hope nobody buys into this.",1
I will never buy another ea game,1
,1
EA takes a dump on a classic franchise.,1
,1
"Micro transactions, always online, reconfigured gameplay to milk users instead of just paying for a game upfront. Fail.",1
"The game crashes when the phone goes to sleep  The game tries to interface with you g+ acct every time you start, asking for permission to make posts etc.  I didnt even get to the microtransaction part.  This game is a poorly executed attempt to cash in on peoples fond memories of dk",1
I feel like I would love this game if it just wasn't for the terrible way the game is designed between the unnecessary wait times and limiting resources.,1
More like pay to play its not even good Don't be fooled by the 5 stars . EA representative you are a scum for forcing people to put a 5 star rating,1
,1
"Don't try to cheat the system EA. Ratings are for legitimate feedback, not things to be bought for publicity.",1
More like PAY TO PLAY.  GO TO HELL EA,1
"Barely free to play. It's basically pay2play later on. Not fun, bad ui, and money hungry EA ruining another franchise",1
This is as pay2win as it gets. Also ea is deleting non 5 star reviews.,1
Shame on EA for creating this microtransaction laden fetid corpse of a once great game and shame on those who support it,1
"The microtransactions turns a wonderful remake of a classic, into a horrible pile of steaming crap.",1
IAP. Waiting an absurd amount of time to actually get anything built without paying. Tries to prevent players from giving it a rating of anything less than 5 stars. This is not Dungeon Keeper.,1
"Not worth your time, unless you're into games dependant on in gamr purchases. Maybe try Tapped Out. Way better game",1
There is nothing redeeming about this gaming model.,1
Paying money doesn't even make things move faster! Its a disgusting money grab and a true embodiment of the industry ruining qualities of EA,1
"This app continually asks for you to spend money. Pretty much everything you do is met with some sort of ""Hey, pay so you don't have to wait!"" message.  When is EA going to realize that if you make a quality product, people are willing to spend upwards of $15 - $20 for it. There wouldn't be any need for you to ask people for micro transactions in a game every five seconds to earn a profit.  Hell, Kerbal Space Program wasn't even made by a game company, and now the creator is sitting on a cool $1million+. What's your excuse EA?",1
Stay away unless you want to pay and pay.,1
What a joke. I've never seen micro transactions shoved down my throat so heavily. Either pay or make one move per day,1
Garbage app. EA is known for being a bad company with every game costing mire money to play.   This game is nothing new.,1
,1
Title says it all,1
Pay to play,1
,1
Microtransactions suck. Down with EA!,1
"Yes. It's a mobile game. Pay to win sucks. Just slowly grind through it and it's a great game. Im just happy to see the series revived, it's my favorite of ALL time and this is fantastic. I may not love EA, but I LOVE Dungeon Keeper.",5
Whenever I play it will crash and I have to start everything all over again,1
They have to filter out the bad ratings to make this game look good,1
This amount of price gouging is unacceptable and EA should be ashamed of trying to sucker people into 5 star ratings!,1
"The game forces you to sit around and wait for longer than is reasonable, even in a free game, and asks far too much money to be able to even actually play. But the worst thing about this game, for me, is that it manipulates the Review scores! They only bring people to give a Google Play Review if they promise to give a 5 star review in the in-app form! Anybody who rates it a 4 or lower in the app are brought to a ""feedback form"" instead.",1
I installed hoping for the glories of Bullfrog past. But the incessant NEED for gems is ridiculous. This game is unplayable without paying... and paying a lot!,1
"Rigged voting made me come online to vote, played for less than a day and I've hit the pay wall. Ruined another great IP",1
It's just an excuse to spend money on a timer.,1
A disgusting cash grab ruining a classic ip.,1
"What's the point, won't let me play it anyway. Have to pay to do everything.",1
Nearly unplayable due to having to wait so long for tasks. 4hrs to clear a block? Pass.,1
"Literally the only way to play this game is by throwing money at it, and I'm talking Lincoln's and Jacksons.",1
Wow they should call this game Gem keeper. .. EA I will vote for you as worst company again.,1
"This should be ""pay to play"".  Technically it can be played for free, but you'll have to wait an entire day to perform the most basic of tasks. This game has taken the time penalties for free players to absurd heights. In order to buy in your faster gameplay you really need to pay about $50 in order to make this game enjoyable, no thanks.",1
"If you restart your device you MUST download all the updates again (41.41mb for me), so it's eating up all the data in my plan",3
"Update: latest patch added an unmutable voice prompt. Terrible decision, EA.  Older than review still stands: ""... geared to suck your wallet dry.""",1
This game is essentially a massive money pit and a scam.  Times are inflated for the sake of forcing money to be sent.,1
Boring,1
Awful,1
"One of the great games of the 90's absolutely ruined by EA's usual greed above all design.  I would have happily paid $10+ for a decent port of the classic but instead they've turned it into yet another ""pay us more or wait forever"" game.  Shameful.",1
Unplayable without paying.,1
Just like everything else ea puts put. They use these apps to fuel the larger games.,1
Don't spend a cent on this ruined game just spend your money on the original.,1
This isn't even a game. It's just a means for EA to take your money while they try the worst implementation of microtransactions I have ever witnessed in a video game. I'm done with giving this company my time and my money,1
It's a shameful attempt to tug at the heartstrings of people who remember the incredible Dungeon Keeper games.  I was disgusted with the cute art style and and complete departure from the classic game play.,1
"Your entire executive team that think people want in app purchases. Needs to get fired,  or better yet... killed so they don't take their retarded thought process to another game developer. EA sucks.",1
"Game is designed around monetization and disrespecting the player's time. Next time, focus on making a fun engaging game on its own merits the priority.",1
"This game app is an awful cash grab that only links to review if you want to rate it 5 stars. If you download and do NOT like it, please find it on googleplay and review accordingly",1
This nickel-and-dime model of gaming has to die. It is complete garbage to have to pay a few bucks every time you want to do anything. Complete trash.,1
,1
"EA has ruined yet another great game.  I would of rather paid outright for this game, than be ripped off by yet another microtransaction type game.  I gave the game plenty of time to win me over, but this whole free to play genre just needs to go away already and quit ripping people off.",1
This game uses some of the sketchiest ways I've seen in the history of mobile games to incentivize micro transactions. Is rather pay $15-20 for a quality game up front then support this game model. Can the real publishers please stand up and show us some options worth supporting?,1
"...ruins what could have been a fantastic game. The sense of humor and innovative gameplay are there...a little bit. The blatant, aggressive pay-to-play monetization makes this a non starter.   I'm sad.",1
"This game isn't very fun. There's not much skill involved, unless you count ""patience"" as a skill. You just tap to update stuff, tap to summon dudes, tap to collect your items. And then you wait.  Unless you decide not to wait, then you can pay real money for gems, and hurry things along. Yay? So you go and attack another dungeon, but there's not much you can do in terms of strategy, brute force works just fine.  Someone attacks you, and... who cares? You get a notice saying your dungeon was attacked and then one tap makes everything all better. Maybe you lost a bit of your resources... but that's okay, more are just a few dollars away.  Even if I had endless money to spend on the gems, I can't see this being a fun game. Just a time and money sink.",1
Graphics and controls are horrible.,1
Don't download this scam.,1
So boring can play and just clone other games.,1
What game? This is awful,1
The original version of this game was amazing... I wish this did it justice :-(,1
This free to start playing model is getting old.  I'd much rather have more full content games that I need to pay up front for.,1
"I grew up with the Dungeon Keeper games and loved them. Such a great and entertaining IP, but knew it was doomed when EA bought Bullfrog. Wish they had just left it dead an buried instead of reducing it to this pay to wait garbage.",1
,1
Any progress you want to make you will have to pay for it. The alternate is to wait weeks or months to build up enough in game currency to progress.,1
Ridiculous amount of time needed and you can't do anything with that time. Asking for money immediately. Really disappointing,1
"This game epitomizes badness. There is really no game here, just a series of in-app purchases. The game also prompts you to rate it. Then, if you give it less than 5 stars, it takes you to a support page so you dont go through with the rating. If you give it 5 stars it takes you to the Google play store to leave your rating. Coercive, sneaky, bad.",1
The microtransactions are ridiculous,1
24 hours to remove a piece of stone?  Insane.,1
"Stupid app tried tricking me into linking my G+ and wouldn't let me leave a rating properly.   Way too expensive, ruins this franchise.  Pay to play is a plague amongst games.  Stop exploiting us.",1
Don't buy this trash.  Forced to buy items using real money.  Completely terrible.,1
Do not play this is the worst IAP game ever.,1
This has to be one of the worst free to play implementations I have ever seen. Incredibly disappointing unless you enjoy sending EA cash. It also had an obnoxious audio notification that plays even with the application closed.,1
"They have DESTROYED a beloved game. PAYWALLS! seriously EA, I hate you own the rights to this game. 3.5 hours to dig a block! So sad that they killed this IP. This is why EA has won worst company in the world 2 years in a row on consumerist. The only people giving this app 5 stars have never played the original two games.",1
Just too many micro transactions to make it fun.,1
"Cons: Awful, awful F2P execution. Pros: Consistency - one can always count on EA to disappoint.",1
"It's ok. Way too expensive and time comsuming. No crap it's a ea game. It gets boring when you can't do anything for hours at a time. Your more or less forced to spend money to get anywhere. Also, there is no s-pen support which is a pain as well. Another money grabbing ea title. This would be a amazing game if time was cut in half. 4 hours to mine a wall? Get real. Your going to lose customers on a would be great game. I suppose I'll uninstall.",2
"Playing this game brings back memories of the old dungeon keeper, but between the long wait time to get stuff done and the insane increase in upgrade costs, it requires real money to get anything done. The other annoying thing is it decided to delete my game progress, and had to start over after a large amount of progress. I decided not to risk it being deleted again, and uninstalled the app.",2
Avoid,1
"Good idea, graphics, and voice over (+5). Shelled out $42 to beef up defenses. Had Ft. Knox until I watched an attackers wizards walk right through Reinforced Walls if they are diagonally adjacent to a room. Bug just put game on scheiBe list (-2). Also with recent patch, cancelling builds now returns only half resources. So if you fat-fingered on a touch device, you're punished (-1). Finally, patch also took away trap swapping. So instead of a single, easy Grab & Drag on a touch device, it now requires at least 3 G&D's. Annoying (-1). I'll keep playing to see how bad/good it gets and hopefully see my $$ invested in improvements.",1
EA is just after your money they don't care if you like the game or not they just want you to pay in order to pay the game.,1
Pay to play everything. This is not dungeon keeper. Get the original not this garbage. You'd have to be a true sucker to spend money on this,1
"There's a difference between (completely reasonably) needing to make a profit, and a compete shakedown. Learn how to make fun games that don't make the majority of casuals resent you and your label.",1
"This port is a cash grab and nothing more.  Pay money to avoid waiting, telling me the best value is to buy $100 worth of gems, having to wait 24 hours to mine out one square?  No thank you.",1
"Huge fan of the old series and this is a shameless pay to play rip.  Uninstalled and removed it as soon as I was able.  I am sorely, sorely disappointed.",1
No wow,2
It's just a clone of your typical mobile free to play city builder with a ton of microtransactions thrown in.   There's nothing here to keep you coming back,1
"I felt like every movement of this game was encouraging use of the gem system, and we must as I tried to ignore it and enjoy myself, I could not. Simply predatory.",1
This is not even close to the original Dungeon Keeper games.  It's designed to annoy the user in to paying as much as possible.  Truly a disgrace to the franchise.,1
The game has been so heavily burdened with in app micro-transactions that the free price point should be investigated as criminal false advisement .   They have also edited the game to make it very difficult to give lower than a 5 star rating on Google Play.   Shady business practices has ruined a great old game.,1
"You would expect a huge company like EA would put some effort into a game, but you would also expect consumers to stop giving them money. Very deceptive practices still going on. Pay to play is not what your consumers want. Listen, for once, and you won't be voted worse company for another year.",1
"Man is this just an all around horrible experience. Don't waste your time, and definitely not your money.",1
,1
No fun at all Really.,1
Any charm this title might have had is immediately buried under hundreds of hours of waiting unless you decide to spend absurd amounts of money on the in game currency. Almost four hours to clear a single block right out of the tutorial? Pass.,1
Dungeon Keeper pits you as the bad guy managing a dungeon.  On iOS and Android Electronic Arts has milked the games name for exactly  what they're known for. Everything it's worth.  24 hours to break a block of dirt/rock? Oh get real. Save yourself a lot of time and money and go on Good Old Games (GOG) and buy Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 for $10.  The fact that they won't let you vote anything less then a 5 in game (It asks you to email their automated system to tell them how the game can 'earn a 5' is absolutely sickening.,1
Asking for money at every turn. Slow gameplay,1
,1
Atrocious and heavy handed scam to milk your pockets,1
You hit a pay wall well within 10 minutes of starting the game. This is nothing like the old Dungeon Keeper. People looking for the old Dungeon Keeper experience should pass on this game and look for war for the underworld on PC. It is obvious that EA has no idea how to handle this IP. I would rate 0 out  of 5 if I could.,1
"Short lived game. Bullied by inapp purchases. A shame for the old DK, really.  They just can't stop jacking gem prices for supp. minions and other upgrades, seems to me like they're milking this for the most money possible.. There's some good idea here and there but in the end it's just another pay to win. Greedy EA and their ""vision"" of DK really ruined it IMO.",2
Bleh,1
This is not the DK we all loved from the 90's. It's a micro transaction nightmare! Its a real shame to...there is a great game buried in gouging scheme.,1
"Hey look you jerks, here's the one star you deserve. Quit allowing crappy games and this could change",1
this app is an insult to what was a great game. Excessive abuse of microtransactoions and unrealistic delays on almost every action.,1
"......That sucks. This game is a destruction of a wonderful IP. If you download this and pay for the gems, you're basically asking EA to continue to ruin any franchise they get their hands on. This isn't a game. It's a put money into EA's pockets program.",1
Games like this are ruining the mobile gaming market. EA is a scumbag company and destroyed the Dungeon Keeper franchise.,1
Not only can you not rate this less than 5 stars from the app but the grossly priced gems in game plus the need to buy them very quickly destroys this games potential.,1
,1
Game would be fun but you have to pay to progress in the game. I would so pay 5 bucks for it and probly play it for as long as I could but microtrans. Suck balls everything is so expensive I want to meet the dumb person who pays 99 bucks for a few gems in a mobile game.....in short if u want to spend months just to build oneroom then this is the game for u but not me ..uninstalled.,1
Worst micro transaction based game ever.  You have to throw tons of money at the game to even play more than a couple hours...,1
"EA poops all over another classic.  Don't believe the 5 star ratings - EA has rigged the review process.  Pay to wait, poorly implemented, poor design, tarnishing a classic.  Developers should kill themselves.",1
Ruined a classic.,1
"If you are expecting an experience like the Dungeon Keeper of old, look elsewhere.  Everything is geared toward pushing micropayments.  Terrible.",1
"Dungeon Keeper for PC us one of my all time favorite games. I cannot express the disappointment this game caused me. It's not that they changed the way the game is played, that is perfectly understandable given the mobile medium, but the way the iap is Integrated into the game saps all the enjoyment out of it. What is even more frustrating is the game doesn't have to be this way, all it would take is tweaking the game so as not to be skewed so heavily towards wait timers.",1
"Is absolutely FULL of micro transactions that the game is designed to force down your throat if you don't want to wait 10,000 hours for your stuff to complete. Also forces five star reviews from users to make it seems like the  game is NOT actually unplayable when it really is.",1
"The game can be fun, the voice and sound work is really nice, and the Dungeon Raids can get interesting. The constant push to use gems though to avoid long delays is an obvious ploy to generate revenue and detracts from what could have been a 5 star game.",3
Worth less than a star. Might have given 2 if EA hadn't made me jump through hoops to give 2 stars.,1
"Disgrace to the Dungeon Keeper name and legacy, I feel sorry for the guys and gals at EA mythic that had to make this game, I know doing this kind of work is not what they always dreamed of doing. That being said, the game itself is actually very good, but all of the shady bs to try and get my rating and money heavily outweighs anything else.",1
"If you ever played the real Dungeon Keeper(s), you would know how bad of a rip off this is. This game is the definition of monetary greed, and worse! The creator said in an interview that the dev team wanted to stay true to the original game. Then they made this Clash of Clans reskin.",1
The pay to play model is payware. Let me pay once for the full game. Uninstalled.,1
"Yet another IP ruined by EA.  They took a wonderful game,  remade it,  slapped on a ton of micro payments, added waiting periods to do anything,  added more required payments,  etc.  This is the most expensive stop watch app on the play store.  Avoid this game and this company!!",1
the absolute worst in-app purchases game out there. if you have 2 years to play once a day this might be free for you. if you have a few thousand dollars to blow you should go to Vegas or just give it to anyone on the street and they can do more with it than the enjoyment of this game.,1
Everything requires micro transactions. The game tries to stop you from giving ratings under five stars.    The takeaway is to not get any games from EA until they massively change their ways.,1
Don't bother. Pay to play.,1
Money grubbers,1
...,1
This game is unplayable with out paying obscene accounts if money.,1
"Takes days for anything to upgrade. Unless you pay, of course. C'mon EA",1
"This game was a let down. WA's really looking forward to it. money grab to do anything. Also, It didn't let me rate the app in game. It would take me to an email instead. This is not how you treat gamers EA.",1
"Played dungeon keeper on PC, this is not the same game.  Also keeps prompting me to log in or sign in every time I start the game. Does not save progress.",1
RIP in Peace Dungeon Keeper of my childhood.,1
"Terrible. Pay to play, despite being free.",1
"Paywall, payscheme, pay day for EA. Its a terrible scam, and a perfect example of what is wrong with mobile gaming. Don't support these guys.",1
"Just as I'm trying to decide if the game will be worth paying for the micro transactions,  it prompts me for a rating.  This is okay until I realize it's trying to filter away anyone who wants to rate the app 4 stars or less.   Combine that with the high price of gems and I have to give this one a complete pass.",1
"Awful. Micro transactions.  And EA is funneling this so only 5 star ratings get through. It has 4.5 stars but if you look at the reviews, you'll see everyone hates it. THIS IS WHY EA SUCKS.",1
"Get rid of micro transactions, make me pay for the game outright.   But the developers already know micro transactions suck.",1
"to express my disappointment in this sham of a game. i played it for about 15 mins. and it was just slow, boring, ended up hitting a paywall to advance after ""tutorial"" .  the star is only cause i was forced to rate it, and would give the game no stars if i could",1
"I reported to EA that the game would not sign in.  The response was a link to their help page.  When I tried to use the help page, it demanded an Origin sign-in.  Sorry, EA, I'm not going to make an Origin account on the off chance that you can make an Android app work.",1
Slapping well-loved IP on a clone defender game does not translate into a good game.  Pay to play and deceptive rating screen redirect.   EA once again demonstrates their contempt for their customers.,1
"""Pay to play"" issue aside, I was enjoying this game until the third defense mission. I noticed my defenders were just letting mobs run right past them or standing in a hall as a single skeleton took out my heart from 75%. Also, random rooms would explode into spawn points even though nothing was attacking.  Please fix for better re iew.",1
Needs the clan system improved.,5
,1
Stop with all this crap.... make a game that is actually worth playing,1
Don't trust the high ratings. The in-app rating makes it hard to leave anything but a 5 star rating,5
This game starts off ok and quickly degrades into a question of how much money would you like to spend? Very not free.,1
This is the worst game I've ever seen. There is a reason why ea won worst company in America three times in a row.,1
"If you loved the original DK game, stay far, far away from this game. It's got a blatant pay-to-win system, is barely playable for people who want to play it for free, etc. It's one of the worst offenders in the free-to-play realm, and unless you love being frustrated, don't bother wasting space on your device with this game.",1
"If you want to ""play"" a game where you pay so that you can pay some more without ever having to do real gameplay, then this is the perfect game for you!",1
"The controls are pretty terribly laid out and the basic mechanics are rigged for in-app purchases. Aside from that, this game just doesn't have the class and humor of the classic Dungeon Keeper titles.",1
,1
Ruined a classic.,1
EA asks users for ratings and links 5 star ratings to the play store. Anything less links to a support form. This ruins the integrity of the rating system. Avoid this app.,1
Dont bother.,1
"I enjoy the game play.  However, the wait times are ridiculous.  4 hours to dig out a gem wall?  Also, it'd be nice to have a few more ways to defend yourself from pvp raids.",3
,1
"It's not bad but it doesn't really have the feel of the old DK games. The pay-to-play aspect is not that great either, but I will do what I always do with those games, just not pay for anything.",2
,1
Nice game nice graphics. You can only play it so far before digging in your pocket for real money to continue. Once I got my game going and started to build  up a supply of gold and stone I was attacked several times in the day as many as 4 or 5 times in a day so there went all the cold and stone I collected to get my heart up to level 4. It seems the game does everything to keep you from getting there with out paying for it in real money. Oh and getting a third imp to work for you yeah right it will take you weeks to get up to 800 gems unless of course you pay real money to get there. Hey Charged me $9.99 for the game and keep the micro trans actions off the table you really know how to make a great game SUCK/,1
Too many micro transactions that aren't even worth purchasing.,1
,1
"Sad, even the game itself admits that people hate the free to play model, but runs with it anyway.",1
"This game is nothing more than microtransactions and pay walls. Don't waste your time downloading it, let alone 'playing' it. Unless you enjoy paying money to speed up a count down timer.   Shame on you EA.",1
"This isn't a free game. You can play it, but it forces/asks you to buy things every few minutes. Total waste of time.",1
"Ridiculous wait times for building single units? I'll pass. Pay-to-Win games will be the death of the mobile games industry, and this is no exception.",1
"If you liked the original series, don't play this and keep your fond memories. Butchered beyond belief.",1
It's not free-to-play. It's not even pay-to-play. This is nothing more than a pay-to-pay scheme. You're paying real money in order to progress to an even more expensive level. Not a real game.,1
Not only did it slow down my phone i still have a lag after I deleted it beware before you download this trash,1
This used to be a fun game by a good company. EA takes over and ruins the company. Years later they ruin a game and make a bad rating system.,1
More like free to download then pay if you want to play.,1
Takes 32 hours to just excavate  a 3x3 area and I don't even know how long to build anything.,1
I'm so glad I still have the original pc game. And still play it . I wished my people wouldn't dissappear after battles if they lived thru it. 5 star if i could keep my remaining army after battles,4
This is not a game don't waste your time with this trash,1
This isn't a game more than it is a clock simulator. The Dungeon Keeper series has been ruined. EA's shady business practices are at it again with the doctoring of the rating system. Sigh.,1
There is a reason this game had so many 0/10 and 1/10 at review sites. Nintendo said it best this game is only 'free to start',1
They just throw stuff at you without explaining anything. I play for maybe 2 minutes before changing to Tentacle Wars. Also their shady methods of getting only 5 star rating is despicable.,1
The free to play era will be remembered as a weird smelly time in gaming.  Thankfully there are others that don't follow the model.  It can't end soon enough for me.,1
This game is pretty much exactly how you'd imagine a modern remake of a classic game would be if done on mobile: grindy and with a pay to win scheme!,1
"This retains a 3-Star rating; out of respect from the child I was and forever am.  Jumped into this when a friend mentioned it awhile ago; loved the first few hours, couple days and the two weeks through. It does bring back the PC feel into a Tablet environment which is so bonus. I would've payed a $4.99 one-time to get the full build altogether, as I would any other childhood memory-bridged game - BUT instead, Gamer beware.   Game Hurts So Good. Love hurts. Join Forces - There's power in numbers. Numbers don't lie; Its economics. Digged. Devised. Nefarious. Indeed.",3
All bad business practices in one. No respect for the player at all.,1
,1
Horrendous microtransaction system and deceptive as well as manipulative ratings that actually completely break Google's terms of service. Honestly why is this app still here?,1
A very clear pay to win by the Voldemort of gaming...EA.,1
,1
I wouldn't even call this a game. The wait times on things is ridiculous but oh you can speed it up with real money if you want.,2
"In order to play the game to its full potential, you must invest over $100 in micro transactions.",1
Best ive played in a while. Keep  up the amazingness,5
,1
Greed &gt; Gaming... EA would rather flog the micro  transactions than release a refined version of the great original. Deleted after three minutes.,1
Pay to play is becoming typical of EA.,1
"A boring, terrible, MONEY GRUBBING waste of a good franchise that treats you like a wallet who needs to be milked periodically. This is not Dungeon Keeper.",1
Only way to play this game effectively is through micro transactions. Makes the game very dumb as well as the constant reminders every 15 mins. Don't waste your time.,1
Got bored as soon I hit heart level 3. Way better free to play games out there.,1
Its another EA game that has micro transactions and it takes 24 hours to clear 1 block and this game is gonna get EA the worst company in the world award 3 years in a row. ALL EA WANTS IS MONEY FROM PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT HAVE THE MONEY THEN THEY DONT GIVE A S*#T ABOUT YOU. step your game up EA!!!,1
The most debilitating micro transactions I've ever seen. A compete and utter scam.,1
Yea so game won't even load awesome,1
An interesting and delightful response to the increasingly popular Clash of Clans game.,5
Pay to win has become pay to play. Just charge money from the start instead of making people think this is a free game.,1
Stop using the micro transaction model and you'll get a better rating,2
No thanks. Always in data connection is a terrible idea.,1
"I gave this a solid chance. But after a few hours, nope, it's just another cow clicker. Very very greedy FTP.",1
"Uninstalled immediately when I notices what a giant rip-off this game is. These micro-transactions are overpriced, ruin the game and display the pure greed of EA. They are screwing their customers.  DON'T INSTALL, and make some noise. This is not OK.",1
,1
Free to play? More like pay to play. You're better off developing a cocaine habit then to start playing this crap.,1
"This game would be fun, if it weren't pay to win. Good job ruining a franchise.... again.",1
"The in app purchases are out of control. I don't have a problem with micro-transactions, but the model EA uses here is disastrous for developing any flow in the game. They fundamentally broke the game play, and their pricing for restoring it is absurdly high. It's really a shame. If you're feeling nostalgic, find an old copy of Dungeon Keeper 2.",1
"If you like 30 seconds of doing something followed by 24 hours of waiting then this game is for you. Otherwise avoid like the plague. Horrible pacing, not fun at all.",1
,1
I'm not sure what EA did to this game but its BAD! And something is up with its rating... It could never get that many stars!,1
Please do not download this game if you can even call it that. EA are pushing gaming into a norm that is not healthy and is ruining the way games are meant to be played an enjoyed.,1
purely awful. a true showing of everything wrong with mobile gaming,1
Not free to play.,1
"It is so bad with that nonsense that it seems almost like its trying to be a parody of the mobile gaming genre. It may be free to download, but unless you're willing to give them your entire paycheck, don't expect to play more than a few minutes every other day.",1
The best,5
,1
"Almost unplayable without a continual influx of real money.  I played for 3 hours before I discovered this trap.  Fortunately, the game just isn't very exciting.  So it was easy to delete and not get sucked into paying.",1
I like it,4
Garbage game that nags you to review it as 5 stars,1
And now to learn they are changing results to get mostly 5 star ratings. For shame EA,1
ITs a goodie,5
EA ruined this game.,1
Been playing this game for a morning and now I have to wait 4 hrs or pay to keep the game moving forward.  Not liking this design.  I'd rather pay $4 and have easy access to the gameplay.,1
Way to many microtransactions. Tutorial is wayyyy too long. Time limits everywhere.,1
"The game incessantly attempts to get me to share my Google+ information with others. Even after clicking no, it will continue popping up randomly before I can even view my dungeon. Why isn't there an option to disable Google play integration? Secondly, this game uses the same exact resource system (with different names) as Clash of Clans. For such a prestigious IP, this is a disgrace...",3
Great remake of the original.  Much like many of the other build empire games just with a bit more wicked theme which is fun. Bonus ringtone comes with it which is pretty cool. Maybe just my Note 2 but it seems to take forever to load. Tip-Push updates while I'm sleeping instead of checking for every time I load the game.,3
Overstuffed nothing with micro transactions.,1
The waits for mining doesnt just slow the gameplay it STOPS the game play forcing you to spend a ridicoulous amount of money for not much gain.,1
"It starts off simple, and quite fun, but as soon as you start picking up the pace the game shoves advertisements to buy gems from it to ""speed""  up your building process. Simply put, unless you want to wait a whole week to build something, you have to BUY some gems to instantly build it.   The fact that the game isn't even subtle about shoving paid transactions down your throat is violating. It takes away from the experience and it makes me sad to see a classic franchise get turned into a cash grab.",1
Stops working after first run of app. Times out on update at startup.,1
Download it!,5
"Thanks for ruining a perfectly good classic, EA.",1
The game requests too much privacy control.  I have no faith that EA is a company that can be trusted with such information and control.,1
"Also, being asked to rate the game and not being directed to the App store rating *UNLESS* you tell the game you're going to give it 5 stars is unethical.",1
with a sneaky rating system that directs you to a feedback form if you try to rate it under 5stars.,1
"It has it's fun moments but it's hard to wash down the ""pay to play"" feeling when you play. Hard to get resources as it but I don't need constant reminders about how I can buy a boost or resources in the shop. Other than the shop the game is fun, though I'd have preferred a single purchase version.",3
"Thanks for destroying a bit of my nostalgia, EA.  I'd have paid good money up front to revisit dungeon keeper, but not like this, and not that much.  You can't have my money now.",1
"Designed to wring microtransactions out of as many people as possible, not designed to be a fun game. Don't waste your time.",1
They are fishing for 5 star rating,1

"Too much wait time right at the start of the game. At least give players time to learn before imposing 4 hour wait times. Gems also seem absurdly overpriced. The cheapest option is 5 dollars which is barely enough gems for one in game purchase, although it is enough to speed through a few wait times.",2
"Every app that has a pay to continue playing function (ala gems to rush production in this case) are horrid time sinks that just try to squeeze a ridiculous amount of money out of you. There needs to be an ""unlock everything"" option for a reasonable price (like $10 for a feature rich game like this could be).",1
I can't believe EA is shoveling this pay to play app down people's throats.  Look up gameplay from the original Dungeon Keeper games and see how EA has ruined the name with this app.  Shame on you EA.,1
J,5
To build all the things... But that's all I do,1
,1
"Top that off, everything is too expensive!",1
Nothing but another EA money grab app. Pay to pay more business model,1
"An example of a ridiculous business model taken to an asinine conclusion.  Want to do something?  Hope you can wait for a few hours or have a couple bucks to spend.  And what's worse - lets say you actually pay them, what then?  Well if you want to do something pay them or wait.    EA's bean counters ruining what should have been a nostalgia inducing classic.  What else is new?",1
"Hope you love spending money, there is very little except hidden fees waiting for you here.",1
,1
This is the nail in the coffin for the DK series. Honestly shameful they did this to the series. I would rather pay $10-20 up front and maybe get a good game than get walletraped with iap like this game is trying.,1
"If you're going make a clash clone, don't do.it.on a great I.P. make a new one. This game would have been great at a premium without the ""cash for time"" roadblocks.",1
,1
Too many overpriced microtransactions. I'd rather pay a flat fee for the game and enjoy the game rather than constantly having to pay.,1
I love do it is awsome,5
Full of micro transaction and not game play. Toxic,1
"Basically one giant money machine, barely a game at all.",1
"Outrageously expensive to play. The only way to accomplish anything is to shell out cash, otherwise you're waiting a week to do anything and that's not a game, that's a bore.",1
"This is not Dungeon Keeper.   I would give a gameplay review, but its not worth my time. Which its also apparent it wasn't worth their time either.   EA = Money Money Money nom nom nom... What's a gamer?",1

"I really think this is a fun game and I quickly got addicted to it. The only thing that would give my rating the fifth star is if the gems were easier to come by for players like me who do not pay for free-to-play games. If it's free-to-play, I'm playing for free. I think the in-game achievements should be worth more gems. I've been playing for a week now and am still not close to getting my third imp because it costs too much.",4
"Terrible game. Great concept that was completely destroyed by the ""free to play"" model implemented. This game Is basically tiny tower with a dungeon keeper skin. Be warned that every action, beyond the first 15-20 minutes, takes hours or even days unless you spend money.   I would enjoy this game if I was able to purchase it in full and not be time limited.",1
Everything that's bad about the monetization of free games is present here. The game doesn't respect the player's money or time. Don't waste either on this one.,1
This game is completely unplayable without having to pay. This model of mobile games needs to stop.,1
It wants permission to attach itself to g+ and it costs money at every single turn. Very disappointing.,1
Doesn't capture the feel of playing DK. Just lightly covers the mechanics and piles on lots of wait-to-play. UI reeks of nagging to use gems and buy boosts. Only takes you to gplay review if you say you'll give it 5 stars. It made me go buy War for the Overworld on PC.,1
Sweet goodness things take forever to do unless you spend a ton of money. Just let me buy the game and play like normal.,1
I love the dungeon keeper ip. Its a good time killer.,5
Please stop with the pay to play games. Especially when they are destroying quality franchises like Dungeon Keeper.,1
forces you to rate 5,1
Can I do less than one star?,1
"Seriously, nothing like the actual Dungeon Keeper.  Slow and boring.",1
Everytime I close the app I must start over from the begining. Being a fan of the original game I wanted to try this and am massively disappointed that a company like EA can't make this work properly. Galaxy S3,1
"Games like this did not use to concern me at all. Now cash shops and extra features are leaking into retail games on consoles and PC. Games that you pay $60 for are asking for more money to get the full potential of the product. It's a ridiculous direction for the gaming industry to take.   I've played video games since the SuperNES came out, and I will continue to. However, I will.not give one cent more to companies for a game I already paid for. Do not encourage this strategy. One star this POS.",1
Garbage,1
Forces players to rate it 5/5. Do not play this. Terrible game designed around wasting your time to force you to buy gems.,1
Horrible fee-to-pay game,1
In app purchases are shoved down your throat as soon as your start the tutorial. Can only scratch the surface of the game without spending tons on Gems,1
"The idea is good, but quickly takes too long to build anything without spending money. Up to 1 day to mine one block of dirt? No thanks...",1
,1
Nice graphics. Takes me back to the old days of the original game.,5
Evil and legal :),5
"For what it is and what it's suppose to be, it is perfect. It's a really good port of DK. Albeit played in short bursts.",5
The in app purchase model they use is very oppressive and borders on pay to win. The app also makes it hard for you to give an honest review from inside the game. From inside the app if you choose to rate 5 stars you will be taken to the Play store to give your review. If you rate it anything below 5 stars you will be taken to an EA ran site to give feedback. Pretty shameful imo.,1
Was a great game for the PC but this version is just unplayable without paying.,1
Don't bother with this poor excuse for a game.  You can't play it unless you pay. Just took a well known name and added micro transactions out the wasoo.,1
"It's fun either way. People complaining don't have to pay, just be patient.",5
Its cheaper to hire a company to make you this game to play for free then to play this one,1
"EA is attempting to manipulate scores here. Awful, just awful. Add in pay to play and this game is a great example of what not to do.",1
Game lags so much on my s3 that it is near unplayable. Also game keeps going black screen when I temporary lose connection which forces restart.,1
Ok,5
,5
,5
"Full of in app purchases and tries to manipulate ratings. the high rating is a lie, Don't waste your time on this garbage.",1
"It is a blast, especially if you are a fan of the original.",5
"EA should be ashamed. Expensive micro transactions just to be able to slowly progress. Not to mention EA's deceptive way of only letting people who rate it 5 stars actually review it. Terrible practices, terrible game.",1
,1
,5
All was going well until I started needing money to play...,1
Brings back old school,5
Children might grow up one day to believe this is how video games truly are. Pay to play disgrace of a game that has further tarnished EA's brand.,1
The worst type of freium game. Avoid this cash grab by EA. It just a clone of Clash of Clans.,1
So much pay wall...,1
"Most games that are pay-to-wait at least let you make some decent progress before you start to hit the super long wait times, if you're looking to truly play for free. Not this one. Within a few minutes out of the tutorial two taps had me waiting for my imps to dig a single block...for 24 hours. There was no option to cancel, just spend the premium currency. You can do tasks will occasionally give you the currency, but your rewards are usually 10 or less, and the costs to speed up processes hundreds. Skip.",2
,1
"This WAS an awesome game before EA got their bumbling hands on it. Pay-to-play, not Free-to-play.  Plus, you have a scummy pop-up in the game that makes you think you're going to rate the game , but if you rate less than 5 stars you just get to send an email to EA instead of being brought to the Google Play Store.  That's the only reason this game is rated as highly as the Play Store makes it seem, because the majority of the bad reviews aren't getting through.    Strike 3, EA.  I'm done with you.    SimCity + Battlefield 4 + Dungeon Keeper = I'll never spend a single dime on an EA product",1
,1
"Dont bother with this stinker. If you want to just play a game, this is not the one. Every action has a real money speed up action that makes the game playable, but expensive. Skip this one.",1
This is nothing like the old games. The in app purchases ruin any chance of having fun. Really lame of you EA.,1
This is obviously a money grab and a bastardization of the original.,1
"24h to dig a block? Insanity. This isn't a game, it's extortion.",1
Keeps you on your feet a kills a lot of time and you'll have fun too,5
Don't waste your time.,1
Love it.,5
Loved the old game. Put many hours and even bought some gems into this game. It is to the point where it exists for the sole purpose to drain your wallet. It had the potential to be something great but it has fallen very short.,1
"Free to play.. what a joke! The game seemed fun at first (I always wanted to play the original DK), but it started to spoil very fast, as the Devil thingy started pressuring me into using more and more crystals to speed things up... I uninstalled the game 10 minutes later, when I had a choice between waiting 4 hours or 24 hours to wait for my goblins-gremlins to finish breaking those blocks... WHAT A JOKE!",1
A once wonderful IP destroyed by paid to play.  Download Dungeon Keeper one or two for your PC and understand why this game is a horrible insult.,1
This is a poor attempt to cash in on a great IP. The system is straight up pay to play and so not worth the money. And it's always online.,1
,1
"Graphics and sound were amazing. however, the game is blatantly pay to win and they bait 5 star reviews through the game itself. Also the notifications were extremely annoying and no way to turn then off without silencing your phone.",1
"This game takes paywalls to a new level. The rewards you get don't come close to what rooms and upgrades cost. Also persistent DRM and annoying social media integrations.  Also, the in-game rating system doesn't save your review if it's less than 5 stars. It takes you to a feedback page instead.",1
,1
"old classic, new feel",5
"Get ready to pay money or wait interminably long periods for advancement in game! Free to start, but certainly not free to play.  Combine that with the game asking me to rate, then trying to direct me to their feedback page instead of the Play Store when I wanted to rate less than 5 stars. Uninstalled.",1
It's constantly is asking for money. This game is a waste of your time. Look elsewhere.,1
Ruined a once great franchise.,1
Clash of clans is already a mess and this is another poor version of that. Don't bother.,1
Its really fun And really cool stuff,5
,1
"After several attempts at playing, it's HORRIBLE. I had high hopes considering I liked DK2 & I like casual games.  Timers are too long, too expensive if you want to play longer than 5 minutes once every couple hours. AN INSULT TO DUNGEON KEEPER GAMES.",1
"If it didn't check for updates every time I try to load it,  then freeze or take forever it would be much more enjoyable",1
Love it,5
Ludacris in app purchase  prices. No thanks,1
"Way to ruin a good thing, EA. I look forward to the day that EA is universally recognized as the joke they are.",1
This abomination spits in the face of The original Dungeon Keepers. EA is cancer,1
"This game isn't at all free to play. It's pay to play. If you try to give it a bad review in game it takes you away from the Google Play store but it takes you right to the play store if you're giving it five stars. This is a shady game by a shady developer and it's boring, unoriginal, and pretty worthless. Play the original or Clash of Clans.",1
Leave it to EA to turn a classic game into a lame money-wall microtransaction crapfest. It's just another game that is completely unplayable unless you start shoveling money at it. Avoid this greedy cashtrap.,1
"This is a shameless Pay-to-Play game.  If you like having to wait for days to make progress in a game, or you want to throw your money away, this is the game for you; personally, I don't have the stomach for it.",1
Pay to win glitches won't use  the 2nd imp sometimes if the other one is on a job great sound gum graphics Ai needs help and would rather a 8$ charge for a full game instead of the grind fest that exists,1
The biggest pay 2 play scheme ever devised by EA. What a scumbag company.,1
Don't play this game.,1
For some reason I lost all progress and my file is back in tutorial mode. Uninstalling.,1
"The game nags you to pay far too often and without paying you really can't get anything done, even in small doses. Pay to play. 0/5",1
,5
You pay more to play than buying a real game. Should be called pay to play or pay to win. Good job EA. Weren't greedy enough?,1
"This goes against the Dungeon Keeper name, and frankly isn't fun.",1
I played the original on PC and sadly this is but a poor update to the game built around micro transactions.    I would not recommend to anyone looking to re live the old original title.,1
,5
Stupid pay to win bullshit.,1
We used to play this on the computer years ago...lol hours wasted and still loving it.,5
Dd,5
"Pay to win bs, dont bother and save yourself some time.",1
Not so much free to play. This is more of a demo unless you start dumping in cash.,1
This isn't a game. Its the exact definition of cash cow. Thanks for ruining yet another good game EA. YOU SUCK!,1
"The gameplay is fine, but the blatant attempt to siphon money out of users is pretty ridiculous. The pace of the game has been reduced down to fractions of turtle speed, unless of course you pay to speed it up. 24 hour wait times for one block, that's a joke. EA is always consistent about one thing, devising great ways to rip you off. Uninstalled way to quickly, really was looking forward to this game.",1
DRM and pay to win game only don't give them money for this garbage.,1
Incredible game!!!!!!!,5
"The game is garbage.  If you like ""waiting"", then this is yet another awesome ""waiting"" simulation.  If you  like ""paying"" games, then this is also yet another awesome ""paying"" simulator.  If you want to actually ""play"" something?  Then I suggest you try something else.",1
"Look, if this game asked me to buy it up front or through an upgrade to ""Pro"" I'd love it and drain my battery daily playing it, but instead you'll need to continuously feed it to keep moving. Fail to feed it and the game slows to a relative crawl. Ultimately the publisher has a really good game here, but it's buried under (imho) excessive monetization.  That's my opinion at least, maybe you'll enjoy it better than I did.",1
Well thanks EA for destroying a great game from the 90s. This game you have made is trash and have to pay to play why not just make it like it once was and sell it not reboot it and have it turn in to this garbage you have presented.,1
I want this on record. Stop making games that are focused on in app purchases. I want to play a game. Not some animated store where the prices roll forward. I would gladly pay you money if you actually made a game. This thing we have here is an abomination and an insult to actual games made elsewhere.,1
"Have to pay to play nearly any amount, game actually will not let you rate below 5 stars using the in game rater, which is why the rating is so high.  Game feeds on nostalgia and weak willed people. Find the original online",1
This is a cheap clone that abuses a well known name and asks for cash at every corner.,1
A total rip off.,1
"Its like the CPU version, but made to make money, so if you want ""The real dungeon keeper"" then buy it off ebay. I fell in love with it. If you could make it easier to change accounts,  it'd be nice. Seeing that after signing out, I am either forced to start another game, until I get ""free roam"" of my dungeon.  Or after log out, I need to restart the game.",5
Its EA.... Period,1
"Do not be fooled -- it's Dungeon Keeper in only the most superficial of ways. This game is a sad attempt to cash-in on people's nostalgia, and will waste no time in luring you into paying by making the game unbearably tedious.",1
Awsome game,4
Great time passer,5
Good game,5
Steer clear. Just a Clash of Clans clone.,1
,4
Cool,5
Pretty cool,5
,1
Not pay to win like other games. Pay to play.,1
Would be nice if this title was just a paid game. Probably give out at least $3 for it. Can't see my self playing more than the few minutes after seeing the in app purchases.,1
"The jury is still out for me. I loved this franchise on the pc. It's pretty well polished. I do need to see how far I can go before I HAVE to buy gems to advance. Tying up your imps for a day to mine gems seems pretty ludicrous.  Update - 2 days later: the model for this game is definitely not fun. I woke up to find my dungeon ravaged and stripped of resources by another player while I was offline. Given that it takes a freaking ETERNITY to do anything without buying gems (900 gems is $8.00, which will buy you a third imp and little else), I'm done. The Program Managers for this game failed in a big way. Not only am I not spending any of MY money here, I'll do what I can to help other players not waste their time here.",2
The worst excuse for a game I have ever seen.,1
It's all rating boosting. EA is getting people to put good reviews for gems/whatever is used to reduce game timers.,1
"There is no gameplay here at all, it's nothing but a UI for giving EA your money.",1
,5
Takes forever to do anything.,1
"Everything is way to much. And if u dont pay well. U really dont play. In tutorial. I think it said money is power why not spend it or somethin like that. EA i hope u read this and see that ur products belong in ur corporate a55. Along with ur greedy CEO he doesnt need anymore money. Atleast put in the description that "" at ea. We take money from the public. Dont download unless ur willing to spend $100+"" uninstalled",1
The most obscene implementation of the pay to play model I've ever seen. Everything is focused on getting you to spend money as quickly as possible. How is this fun?,1
The microtransactions are ridiculous. You could either wait 24 hours for a single tile to be cleared or spend a couple of dollars to get it cleared instantly. This inhibits gameplay horribly. It'd be much worthier of your time to simply find a game that you pay five bucks for once rather than a hundred dollars for over the course of a few weeks.,1
"I played it on my pc, and now for my phone. &lt;3",5
You can't do anything after the tutorial without paying or waiting for 4 hours. Absolutely ridiculous.,2
I hate games entirely based around buying Gems to play the game. Why they are popular is beyond me. I loved Dark Age of Camelot and Mythic should be ashamed of what they have become.,1
It takes forever to do anything unless you're willing to fork over ridiculous amounts of money. the pacing ruins anything that could make this fun.,1
pay Wall is too blatant.,1
This game is pay to play regardless of what the developer says. Don't waste your time. Stick to the PC version,1
"Remember Dungeon Keeper on the computer? This isnt anything like that.  Horrible slow action, terrible time delays between actions and extremely limited gameplay.  Dont waste your time.",1
"A fun game, but ruined by the free to pay model.  In would rather just pay for the game outright.",1
Most games like this at least let you get somewhere without paying.  This game basically forces you to pay to build a tiny square.  Whatever.  I'll go load up the original on my PC and have more fun.,1
Really neat game. Very fun so far.,5
"I would like to play, but I cant get past the checking for updates.",1
"""Free 2 play"" if you don't mind waiting a day for the the simplest tasks",1
Not as good as original but ok all the same,5
Constantly errors out.  Very slow going,2
Great!,5
Ruined a classic franchise. Buy more gems!,1
Payware,1
Avoid!,1
"While it is certainly a graphical upgrade of the original, the microtransactions are pushed so heavily that this game is entirely unplayable without forking over way too much cash. Honestly, this game is sad.",1
A blast,5
Blatant pay-to-win system AND deceptively manipulates user ratings.,1
They ruined this game making by making it a cow clicker. Just make an actual game and flipping sell it!  Stop whoring yourselves out for IAP's.,1
EA ruins yet another game series by making a lackluster game with a pay to win model.,1
Funny and super fun and addicting,5
Pay to play killed this game,1
Not fun at all.,1
This game sucks!,1
"This is EA absolutely at their worst: taking a retro game and rebooting it in the modern era with an absurd pay-to-play scheme. Not only that, they are filtering out poor reviews of the game by asking users in-game what they want to rate the game, then forwarding to a feedback form and not the Play Store review page if you select anything other than five stars. It discourages honest reviews and instead inflates the score. Don't support this kind of behavior!",1
"Too many glitches atm. My game reset itself, so I had to start from scratch. Then in the middle of my new game, my old save was restored... Just nevermind it, uninstalled. =/",1
I love this game very fun,5
This game is pay-to-play or free-to-wait. 24 hours to dig out a single tile? Really? This is nothing like the Dungeon Keeper game I played in the 90's.  The worst part is all of those 5-star reviews are because the game will not let you rate it anything less from the app. All 4 star and lower reviews go to some support site to fill out a support ticket.  Totally outrageous.,1
"This game requires you pay vast amounts of money to make a decent amount of progress compared to other F2P games. Avoid at all costs, reviewing in-game does not submit to the Play Store unless you select 5 stars. Shady shady!",1
,1
The game pathetically attempts to force you to rate it 5 stars. This sort of vote rigging should not be allowed.,1
"The greed of EA never ceases to amaze me. Their lack of hiding it, however, does.  After one gets the hang of it, the player ends up with a 3 minute gaming session every few hours unless one wishes to spend real life money for some unsustainable pleasure.  Nobody judges companies for charging for a game. Programmers have to get paid. A $10 dollar charge for a derivative tower defense game is not too much to ask for one so filled with nostalgia. But no, let's veil our greed under the guise of a ""free"" game.",1
"Holds really close to the original, just tweaked for micro transactions and phone play.",5
,1
,5
"This is a log in every day, click twice and move on with the rest of your day.  No actual game play and extremely heavy handed attempts to get users to spend an obscene amount of money to be able to speed up waiting to do anything.",1
Buy the originals from GOG.,1
Stop ruining our games EA!,1

This game slows down to the point of being unplayable unless you pay outrageous fees.,1
1st time I use it and it doesn't work.,2
,5
Was always a fan of the original. This is a great reworking of a classic.,5
Awesome game I love how it works,5
The game plays very slowly and has too many pay walls.,1
This game tries to force you to buy gems by making basic tasks take very long without them.  Internet connection always required. Avoid at all costs.,1
Bring back some old souvenir !!!,5
,5
"The graphics are good, but I've noticed a lot of issues. You can't answer a text without needing to restart the game, it draws a lot of power, and it doesn't save your progress when still in the tutorial to name a few. Just needs more work.",4
Good Good Budderj J,5
This is all about how much can you pay to play a game. So disappointing. Should just hack the apk and remove the time limits. How fun it would be then.,1
,5
Not pay to play or free to play. You pretty much are playing just to give them money. Great game turned into garbage by microtransactions,1
Good portable rendition of the original dungeon keeper.,5
"A game that refuses to let you play it unless you fork over a lot of money. Never played the original, but 24 hours to make one move is ludicrous.",1
It's fun to play but nothing too new compared to all your other games.,4
Just like the pc one just more mobile,5
I wish I could just buy the game and play it like the original. Add the new multiplayer as new features in the game. Also crashes often and unplayable if internet drops out.,1
What a disgrace to Bullfrog's IP. Please take note that EA is gaming the ratings: attempting to give any rating other than 5 from within the app redirects to a feedback form and doesn't submit the rating to Google play.,1
Very fun I just started and im all ready addicted,5
Fun,5
Fun and time occupying game highly recommend,5
AWESOME,5
"You wont do too well in this game unless you spend money. Game itself is awesome, but definitely set up to be a money vacuum",3
Well done lots of fun and very addicting,5
Not even pay-to-play. You pay so you can have different pay options which cost more.This is scientology of mobile gaming. Stay away.,1
Brilliant,5
After completing the tutorial 3 full times I put a whole day into this game and it still sent me back to the tutorial the next day. Glad this ones free to play. 1 Star,1
Fun,5
I love this and it reminds me of the original,5
give this less than 1 star. pay to even start is what this is. 23k+ people are stupid and should be sterilized for giving this game 5 stars. EA should have gone out of business a long time ago. ruin great games and ruin the idea of free to play.,1
"Game is fun but: crashes my phone, data doesnt save and since it doesn't save I cant get past tutorial mode after it crashes please fix for future players in order to save my phone I had to uninstall not really a game I recomend",2
,5
A new low for EA. Its not a game its a psychological assault on your wallet.  This should be illegal,1
"P2p will always be apparent nowadays. Similar to clash of clans and jungle heat although the digging dirt option and building parameters along with the spawn system during raids are interesting and add to the complexity. If you get mad at slow building and P2p then no game is for you -.- but yeah, core game is still free so have fun!",5
"Yet another game ruined  by EA and the greed of pay to play, no wounder EA was voted worse company. Keep it up maybe you can hold on to your title another year.",1
"EA was voted worst company two years in a row, this is the reason why!! Making us pay for ""Free Games"". This game bleeds wallets  dry of income.  Dungeon Keeper 1 is one of my favorite games of all time, & I'm not going to let your bad decisions ruin a great game. That's how I got past the Mass Effect Saga, that is how I will get past this. EA, I hope you get another Worst Company Award, you deserve it!! I'm not playing this sad pathetic pile of HORSE DROPPINGS!!",1
,5
,3
You want to chop down that square of dirt? That's gonna take four hours. Or you can pay them. No thanks! Just give me a Dungeon Keeper port!,1
So good,5
Great,5
I can't stop playing and I don't think I want to.  Two days no sleep.,5
Unless you're willing to shell out hundreds of dollars a week stay away.,1
"At no point in this bullshit did I ever wish to continue playing. The design is the pinnacle of anti-consumer free to play drudgery. If you want to be annoyed into spending real money on something wholly unfulfilling, unfun, unskillful, and underutilizing of the name Dungeon Keeper, look here! If you stripped out the mechanisms that are designed solely to keep you paying or waiting, there wouldn't be anything left other than the decent artistry of the assets. EA, THIS IS THE SCUMMIEST THING YOU'VE DONE YET!",1
Brings a smile to my face.,5
Demonic,5
Exact same concept as clash of clans. Boring. Sad because DK and DK2 were two of my favorite games ever. Exactly zero of the reasons that the first two were awesome exist in this game.,1
"First, we need to remember what a garbage company EA is and what damage they do to gaming industry and development teams they buy out.. When I saw dungeon keeper game in play store I was initially excited. But then I saw EA logo in the corner and my grin turned to frown.. And after trying it out my fears were confirmed. This is not a game but a way to get people to spend money on nothing. Actions take days and later in the game weeks and months most likely. I suggest playing the original dk2 on GoG...",1
The massive amount of time spent waiting for the smallest task to be completed kills any sense of enjoyment this game could of had.,1
Hellva game play,5
Boring and slow paced. Pay to win nonsense.,1
"It's disgusting to see an old IP turned into this. I was looking forward to this game, but after a few minutes of my time, I'm disappointed.",1
A sad end for a once great game.,1
Why bother? Complete ripoff. No innovation.,2
"Straight off the bat everything feels like Clash of Clans, everything. Its EA's attempt to get in on a multimillion dollar game genre ( though not sure what genre that is). I can see the execs scrambling to find an IP they own they could use to counter Clash of Clans. Well they found one and shat all over it. The pay walls are tooooo high. The time is too long. 12 hrs to dig in some dirt? Come on. I'll probably forget about this game in a week or so. We shall see.",2
,1
I played all of the originals. Graphics back then were terrible. But the game was original in thought and play. Sometimes it's good to be bad...,5
Awesome game,5
"Another series ruined by a ridiculous payment system. You're punished if you don't drop tons of money into this. I would rather pay for the game up front and have no micro transactions than become a cash cow for EA so I can fuel my nostalgic desire to play Dungeon Keeper.  If you're ready to spend $50 on this game then you might get some enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, in the eyes of the developers, you are scum in need of punishment.",1
"Critical bugs in the app. Not only is it a blatant cash-grab, but I lost my entire save after a week. Will not play again.",1
Love the game,5
This is a great game,5
While it has great graphics and a good theme it is the same old build and attack game you can get anywhere else.,3

Not the real Dungeon Keeper,1
,5
Fun game,4
Good game,5
A fun game to kill time throughout the day,5
"Still in the early stages, still interested to see what comes next. Became a little glitchy with the latest update, but patience prevailed.",5
Takes me back when it came out for pc,5
"This nostalgic title suffers from too many micro transactions and the game basically plays itself. It's more like an interactive money grabber than a game, since your actions are very limited.",1
So far,5

Good game,5

Awesome,5
DOWNLOAD,5
"Who would have guessed? The game itself could have been fun. I emphasize COULD HAVE BEEN. Reason being that DK has a fun premise which is ruined by having to wait, let's say an entire day for something to happen. Alternately, you could give EA what it craves (cash) to hasten the process. In short, I hate that EA had to ruin such promise with such bad business.",1
This is a. Cool game,5
Good game to kill time.,5
Very entertaining!,5
"Designed to push the user towards paying for gems. Even the tutorial forces you to use gems. No banking, and accidental misclicks will cost you. Dissatisfied.",1
Awesome,5
"Great game... just crazy prices. If your going to have ppl pay, you have to be reasonable and think im playing games on my phone because im not buying big toys prices, $150 could last a week or less",1
These guys need to learn how to make ftp games or just stick to making games for purchase,1
So far soild game,5
Nice overall.  Good game ea.,5
Its like a big dose of nostalgia but then the pay to win issues customary to EA games get in the way of the fun,1
Fun,5
Good play,5
After update,2
Seems like a pretty good game so far. No complaints.,5

"One of the worst, most unashamedly money-grubbing examples of ""free-to-play"" I've ever run into. Have your wallet ready if you really want to play - and be prepared to dig deep.",1
Keeps crashing on my tablet.,1
Used to play the original bullfrog games on my pc back in the day. That being said this is nothing but a horrible piece of garbage that has been labeled dungeon keeper. Thanks for ruining my childhood ea.,1
What a terrible game. No progression unless you shell out all your money buying gems.,1
Shame on you EA for doing this to such a venerable and classic game franchise. The game itself barely functions and they even have the balls to nickel and dime us to death on the dumbest and most mundane things! DIAF EA.,1
"Other than following the constant theme of trying to sucker you into paying real money for gems to make progress tolerable, it's very well made and entertaining.",5
I used to play this game on pc many years ago. Brings back great memories and i love that im now able to play it on the go,5
"This ""updated""  version of my beloved game has ruined the fondest years of my life by wearing down my patience and my wallet. Whoever thought up this little scheme to rob people's dreams and their hard earned cash is working for Red himself!!  Game play is incredibly slow and drawn out mainly due to the server reconnecting every 5 seconds. The fact that progression through the game in one life time is wholly reliant on the ridiculously priced in app purchases just seals the deal for me... Uninstall <SLAP> back to work!",1
Clash of clans dungeon keeper style,5
,5
"This game is the worst of gaming, creating $100 microtransactions. This is not ok.",1
Have to pay money to play at normal speed. Sucks.,1
So fun!!,5
I have to pay for literally everything,3
,5
5 star for the free update stuff,5
,5
4 hours to dig one square?!?! ( and that's the quickest square next to the 1 day square)  Get it together EA. This game is boring and arduous as hell. Watching grass grow is more productive and fun.,1
It is poop,1
love it,5
Alas dungeon keeper lives again in a new way,5
"You have to wait for everything, unless you want to shell out money. Horrible. Not like the original at all.",1
,4
"Basically you are expected to pay to play this game in real time. and then pay to upgrade anything. They took the worst parts of Clash of Clans and threw them together with Dungeon Keeper, thus ruining the classic. Total waste of the IP",1
,5
"It is just another money/time-wasting game. I miss the original Bullfrog's ""Dungeon Keeper"". This game has no Bullfrog's innovation spirit at all. It does not even deserve the title.

Love it honestly can say,5
Reminds me of the bad ol'days..,5
Its like a slower paced clash of clans im not addicted like i am to it but its fun and stragetic,5
"There is no game here, unless you consider waiting hours to press a button, or pay money frequently for the privilege of pressing that button sooner, any fun. EA is the destroyer of fun.  Seriously, EA game developers, why do you choose to work for such a horrible company? Do you have any morals?",1
Good game,5
"Seemed like it was going to be a fun game at first, but then the tutorial was over. Everything takes time, which means you're not so much playing as checking in from to time - unless you're forking over real money, of course. But what else does one expect from EA these days?",2
Fun,5
"Upon entry to the game I felt pretty welcome, but as I progressed through the game I realized it was a pay to play game. This game is not friendly to those who do not put some form of currency into it. Not only that, but the game crashes quite often. It's a lousy rip off if the original. Hopes for this game are low.",1
"Great game and time burner. You are the dungeon keeper this time, not the hero. MAIM!",5
"For a freemium game there's a lot of enjoyment to be had. The production value for this game is top notch and even though I would have preferred to have just paid for it once and been done, the free play model isn't bad either.",4
I like it,5
Loved the original too!,5
Seems like a great game until you realize after the tutorial the game relays heavily on in-game purchase. You can reasonably enjoy this game without spending a lot.,1
To get anywhere in the game fast you have to pay so say ya wanna mine your dungeon out in less than a week? then you'll have to pay ea quite the sum to do so. Do you want an extra imp to work for you ?  Unless ya wanna wait a couple weeks to earn the amount of gems to pay for one  you'll again have to pay. Unless you feel like spending heaps of money to succeed fast this game isn't for you.,1
"Downloaded remembering and reliving memories of the PC version, but on my tablet, but was sadly, SADLY mistaken.",1
"I would have been willing to pay a reasonable price for an actual Dungeon Keeper port. Unfortunately, this is just another piece of pay-wall crap.",1
,5
To bring back a classic and force in app purchases for any sort of progress!,1
This game is the best,5
"Fun game, loved the original computer versions as well",5
Almost as good as the original dungeon keeper for the pc. Even with the micro transaction gems.,5
AND Then some,5
,5
"This game is the worst kind of freemium game there is. The gems you need to get for speeding up builds or buying perks are overpriced for how many gems it takes to do anything, speaking of, gem costs keep going up. The build times are ludicrous, just to get you to use gems. And, they keep changing the game to make it even harder to play without gems. If they don't start actually listening to the players (instead of doing the opposite of what they're asking for) this game is going to die quickly.",1
"This game is very straightforward and has a great intuitive control setup. It is really a more refined and better developed version of clash of clans. Yes, it is made by EA and their coffers are quite full right now. So, it wasn't out of reach for them to make a better game. To anyone that enjoys playing older PC games; I would highly recommend playing the old dungeon keeper games.  This game is a great time killer and you'll have fun in the process.",5
Great game,5
,1
"Have to pay real cash to do anything was alot fun until my gems ran out then its like give us 20 bucks, or a hundred if your really a sucker , then give us more. Boooooo one star clowns",1
Fun and GREAT!,5
Good game,5
,5
Nice twist to base building fun concept and unique point if view.,5
I like that is has like a clash of clans feel to it,5
In-game good,5
Not worth bothering with,1
,5
Brings Back Memories Of Keeping my Dungeons as a young demon!!!,5
The devil curses,5
"This game puts a new twist on the real time strategy genre: you're not the good guy, you don't control your own units, and your base fights as much as your units. Great port of a classic game!",5
I have been waiting for years! Prices are high but it's awesome.,5
IT WOULD LOAD THEN CRASH WTF !!!!!,1
This game is an embarrassment,1
,1
Pay to play...I should have known better.,1
Lololol,5
Terrible game.,1
It seems alright.  It's not the original but it holds its own.,5
"If you've played the DK series for PC at all, avoid this like the plague. Horrible excuse for DK series game, but I should've seen it coming with the EA branding. I took a chance despite reviews and to my disappointment,  they were accurate. This game screams microtransactions.  STEER CLEAR!",1
Sweeteners,5
,5
Nice game,5
Nostalgia,5

Very fun,5
The game is ruined. Having to wait DAYS to make a bit of progress is horrible. Good job EA.,1
,5
No complaints,5
Km Km,5
"OK... I understand this game has a pedigree, and I also see that it has a 4.5 rating even with complaints, but , here you go, another complaint, the game gave me code 7 which I see other people have that problem... So how is this game highly rated then? I have to give rating one because I havent been able to even play it yet!",1
"This game has gone beyond ""pay-to-have-an-edge"" to ""pay-to-do-anything"". This game is constructed in such a way that you need to spend an insane amount of cash to do anything. Don't even bother installing.",1
This game is fun and addicting much like clash of clans except darker love it.,5
I like this game,5
So far a great fun/funny game the characters are memorable its easy to get the hang of,5
"Great game that has pvp, campaigns and planning all in one game.",5
Not even going to try and play this when It will take most of a decade to play.,1
"Loved the original games, so was excited to try this. Very sad when it turns out to be ANOTHER simple empire building game that takes forever to do anything, costs a small fortune to play, dressed up in DK nostalgia. Sorry, but mobile games are something to do on my commute, and not to throw endless cash at. Uninstall.",1
Good,5
,5
"This is a joke, not a game!",1
,5
I love playing it,5
This game is just a rip off of an old PC game the only differences are the in app purchases and multiplayer action lame I've beat this game like ten years ago,2
,5
I can't support this game has to many microtransactions,1
Fun game!!!,5
,1
Interesting i can't wait to see what happens next,5
"I loved the original version of this game when it was pc based. This is a close facimille, but is largely missing the finess of its predecessor. I realize that this is an app game, but this makes me long for the pc version instead of cheering on this new format. It's slow progress unless you are willing to invest real money (which I'm not).",3
,5
Great,5
Aww,5
I love this game,5
it was quite fun,4
"First, the concept and ideal of making money on ones intellectual property is not in any way foreign or offensive to me.  That being said, this is an incredibly flawed freemium model.  EA has taken a fantastic jaunt down memory lane and turned it into a cheep, soul devouring pyramid scheme, who's fun is relentlessly withheld without it's pound of flesh.  There are good and profitable pay 2 play models on the market; do some research.  You can make money while paying homage to a beloved franchise, I promise.",1
Quit desecrating franchises for a quick Buck,1
Fun,5
Pay to play garbage.,1
"This is a slap to the face of the original games. IaP at its ugliest.  Great potential, but as it stands now, an abomination to a classic.",2

Pretty good tutorial and graphics. Pretty fun all around n smooth performance on my s4,5

Great game.,3
Being bad... Can feel good,5
Horrible,1
Starting to get use to the game. Very good concept.,5
,5
Nothing like the original,1
Coolio,5
Used to be a great game for pc. Now on mobile and I can't get passed the tutorial.... error code 7... fix please!!!,1
"But this is not it. Plus can't store more than 40,000 gold because of the constant raids. Pay to play at it's worst!",1
Fun and engaging,5
"I played the original game and excited for this game. After playing this I enjoy it, however unplayable for me at this time. The major negative is micro transactions (MT). First I don't mind MT as I already happly play Real Racing 3 and Hobbit KoM and enjoy them and spend $. The thing is those 2 games allow you to play 15 to 40 minutes before to hit the wall for MT, this game sadly gameplay time is 5 to 10 mins before you have to wait 4+ hrs or MT$. If balanced would play, spend $ and rate higher",1
"This is a very clever psychological user exploiter, but not an app, and certainly not a game.",1
Really awesome !! Nothing else to say but that!,5
Its all right,5
the original game. Thoroughly worth playing.,5
"The updated version won't allow me to stop at middle of construction, or I will have to lose gold or rocks. And it was 5mins per gem on construction, guess what now? One gem can only speed up 3 mins! None of the change is benefit users but EA himself. Glad to see rate drops, gg",1
Very addicting,5
I love it,5
,5
Stunning graphics and awesome gameplay,5
"Could be decent, but has constant connection problems, and game shuts down with out live connection. EA seemingly requires constant connections for all games now. Probably be one of the last EA games I'll ever try because of it.",2
Unle,3
Its ok cool but i wish it was like the pc version,5
Been waiting along time for this game on a phone or tablet,5
A few buggs I start I and it erases my file kinda weird,3
"I expected some microtransactions,  but really EA, REALLY? If you want to have 'fun' on this app have fun spending $100 at least. I played the original DK 1&2 and they are way better, and DK 2 only costs $5 for 10000% improvement on gameplay. If you rate this more than one star you are an idiot who supports filthy microtransactions.",1
Goood game,5
"I am ashamed to be a gamer in this new generation of ""Gaming"". Please just give us a game that i can pay for in full i could care less if it was $30, at least it is a full game. When i am on the go or at work  and have a spare 2 or 8 hours to spend gaming, i would rather not have small disappointing spurts of gameplay. If Pay to Play is our future of gaming, i would rather be taken out back behind the barn and shot in the back of the head with a dual barrel shotgun by farmer John.",1
Unless you'd like a third imp.  That'll be $8 please.,1
No,1
Ok,4
Great app on my new tablet,5
,5
Game to play in your downtime.,5
Awesome game! Brings back memories!,5
Very interesting need to play more,5
,5
Not too far in but the game play and theme is causing a lot of nostalgia for the original.,5
Only game I can really get into and not delete in a week.,5
Years waiting for a new version and you blew it.,1
So far,5
Great game.,5
,1
I have yet to even play this game because of all the errors I've received and have even had to restart my rooted Nook a few times while trying to load this game. I'm so disappointed because this was my favorite computer game when I was a teen. : (,1
,5
"I get that they want money but looking at the game itself, it is a fun spin off the old one.",5
"I enjoyed my first session, exited properly, came back a few hours later and learned it is timed-based instead of turn-based, so my dungeon had been raided while I was not logged in. Apparently EA prefers customers who have no life or job, which makes one wonder how they expect people to pay for the PayToPlay content. Uninstalling.",2
,5
Give it a try,5
"I tried playing this...really tried.  In order to make any progress in the game you have to dump a *bunch* of money into it.  It's rather ridiculous that it takes 24hrs to mine one wall block an 800 gems to obtain only the third Imp that can do work for you.  I tried to play this for the past five days or so but I just don't think it's worth neither my storage space, nor time - I've uninstalled it...",1
I'm not about to spend a small fortune on this game. I'd gladly pay $5 for this game outright but the pay to win system sucks.,1
F2P model makes the game worthless. Its hard to imagine 20k + 5 star reviews for this game.,1
,5
Its definitely a fun game and extremely satisfying as you get farther in to it.,5
"Fun for a few minutes then quickly turns to a ""Wait to Play"" instead of free to play  some stones take a day to clear.  An actual day  then 9 days later after you clear room, you get to wait again to build the structure.  I don't recommend unless your patience is godlike",1
Good,5
A good revival of the classic. But there's a lot of micro transactions.,4
This game is pretty fun...download it. You won't regret it.,5
Unplayable in a Galaxy S4. After claiming the dungeon I can't click anything.,1
"EA just wants you to pay for everything, don't play if you don't want to waste money",1
"EA seems intent on not merely beating a long-dead horse, but raising it to an unholy mockery of life and raping to ashes in front of it's own family. Read a non-paid review of this game.",1
"Really rich visually and fairly fun to play, but the progress is seriously hampered by the micro transactions. I wish the pace was a little more like the original PC version, not so limited. Without paying for virtual goods I'm only able to play for 5 mins at a time at 4 or 5 hour intervals. Notifications are a little annoying.",3
"Less a dungeon management game than a tower defense game with elements of the classic DK2. Prompts for money (gems, which cost money) or you have to wait for hours or even a day to mine a few measly gems. EA has flushed this franchise down the toilet. A 5 buck scaled down remake of DK2's play style would make me willing to give them my money, but not this travesty.",1
,4
,5
Exeunt,5
Really enjoying it,5
Very immersive gameplay. Community driven and intuitive.,5
,5
New style,5
"Game will not load without data connection. Aggresively advertises ringtones and upgrades. Wish it was less intrusive upsell like ""Injustice Gods among us"". But i guess for EA, the worst company in america, this is pretty good. I like games to be games first, profit engines second.",1
Great game but the prices need to be lower,5
,1
"Huge fan of the original DK so I was very excited to see this game, but came to realize that it was a money trap. Your game progression completely depends on gems which wouldn't you know, either take days of waiting to harvest, or money out of your pocket.  I would've gladly spent a few dollars to purchase this game rather than waste endless amounts of money trying to progress through it. Sad day.  They couldn't even be honest about it being free, it's a shame. The game play and graphics are well done. The payment scheme is not.  Corporate greed at its finest.",2
Excellent,5
There's a problem it keeps going black screen then reloading and takes me back to what ive already did! But I like the idea of the game so please fix,3
It's really ugly looking and is really a bad way to wake up just staring at this face it's degrading please remove this from the play store,1
I like the free form,5
The best,5
To be honest I can't really say anything bad about this game its really worth getting,5
,5
I really enjoyed this game on PC. This is a great port but 2 imps? The cost for more is ridiculous. Days to mine veins is annoying. Overall I like it but will prilly drop it after a month.,3
Legit,5
EA YOU DESTROYED DUNGEON KEEPER!!! :(,1
Fun,5
,1
Ahhhhahhhahhhahhh,5
"Good job, totally reminds me of the originals for PC",5
"The game is blatantly made with a tablet in mind.   The touch interface is hard to use on small screens, and the game requires a CONSTANT Internet connection, like a wifi connection.  Every time I lost connection on 4g, it would boot me out of the game, and ask me to link my Google+ account to the game before letting me resume playing.",2
Helps to kill time while I'm waiting for Clash of Clans. And vice versa. Lol.,5
,5
Great game,5
Fun,5
Good reinvention,5
,5
,5
Fun,5
"This is absolutely ridiculous. What an obvious money grab and in the process, ruining quite a popular franchise. It would be much better to charge upfront for a polished, well made game ,than this crap  with stupid in-app purchase. Without these booster packs, the time it takes to dig out land actually stops the player from playing the game. A great IP gone down the toilet once again.",1
Its a very fun dungeon crawler,5
Great gameplay,5
"My entire quild and I are very dissapointed by this newest update.  If it isn't reverted, fixed, or improved I quarantee lots of people will be quiting.   Severely disappointed as when I started playing, the cost for any has increased expenentionally and the graphics have also hit rock bottom.  The preview pictures DO NOT depict ans acurrate description at all anymore.  Now you basically NEED to spend real money to get anywhere with this game. I even considered doing so, until this latest update.",1
Best game ever evryone should buy it,5
Nicd,5
Pay to play enough said,1
I enjoy this game more than I do other dragon vale type games,5
Greatest game,5
"Free to play mechanics ruin this one classic intellectual property. Try again, EA.",1
,2
"Great free game title. Definatley deserver a five star rating. Other than the gems being hard to come by, very balanced in the resources. Great game overall.",5
Fun,5
Entertaining. Love it,5
Not paying tribute to a classic! Instead you are nickel and dimes around every corner! I refuse to lay down and take it!,1
Their back to the original PC game. Nicely done.,5
,5
However you can earn more gems or seems for free. Good concept only complaint is that it takes 4 hours to dog out the outer soil. Overall good gamut to pick up play and come back after a few hours,4
,5
nice game good graphics and funny,5
"Man, I know time management games are entirely about ""click this and wait an hour"" but Dungeon Keeper takes that to the next level. I think I check it about once a day now, just to collect coins to upgrade something. Raiding doesn't work, I've pretty much capped on the quests without being able to update something.   I started out with a 5 star for the game. I've downgraded to a 3. If it keeps up with the same experience in a week, I'm coming back and editing this to a 1. I normally love EA games, but this is starting to become the digital equivalent of watching paint dry.",3
I used to to play this on my pc all the time I'm glade I got to find it for my phone,5
Do you like tower defence games? You will love this game!!,5

Great game,5
Yay free updates,5
In a way it's like coc,5

Awesome game I can't get enough of it,5
Save your time and money. Go ride a bike instead.,1
So adictive.,5
Plays just like the pc version,5

Similar to clash of clans but with that all needed evil twist. I love it!,5
Good game.  You need a real fast 4g phone to play.  Check it out,5
Assume game,5

Thanks,5

The dungeon you'll find here is the game itself. You could call this whole travesty an exercise in disempowerment. You can do nothing with this game but torch your own money.,1

"Great game, castle clan type , with lots of cool twists for the twisted",5
This Game Is In A Way Like Clash Of Clans And No Lag (Depending On Your Internet) Other Then That One Of The Top Five Funnest Games I've Ever Played!!!,5
Little slow and hard to move the objects but still fun,5
If you love clash of clans well then this might be for you.,4

"Had the original on PC years ago. Had been wanting to play it recently, and came across it yesterday. VERY enjoyable, and a very successful translation to mobile media!",5
Crashes and reloads every few seconds.,1
"It's not even pay to play, which is a bad enough standard. It's pay to pay. All this is is a chance for you to spend more to spend more money",1
Excellent game I played the PC version,5
"another pointless game. not rewarding. even had the option to pay $90 for 100,000 jewels. even then i bet i would have more fun scratching my own face off. EA ... you did it again.",1
Great game looks promising.,5
I still play it on the pc from time time to time. I cannot wait to play this!!!... Update... I gotta keep paying to play? This is a hammed up let down. I was truly excited... ... Not as much,2
Very good game to play,5
I can live with in app purchases but the wait time on stiff is crazy terrible. 24 hours on the best rock to mine? Come on. That ties up half of you imps at the start and you can't do anything but not play. Needs some serious balancing to be a fun game. Would be better as a one time fee game.,1
Really love it,5
I like this game. It's funny and tactical.,5
,1
"Nothing like the original. This app is designed to frustrate you by making you wait for upgrades and building to complete, this way you'll spend money to speed things up.",2
I would rather pay a one time price than being asked for money to do anything.,1

"I have just started this game and haven't played any previous DK before and I already LOVE it, great game",5
Good times,5
Loved this as a kid. So far had lived up to my memory,5
"Microstransactions have ruined this beloved game franchise. I would have paid several dollars to play a mobile version of the original, but timer-based micro-transaction game play is not an enjoyable mechanic. EA, I know you have a lot of scathing reviews to sort through, but if you read this, PLEASE, go back to making games that are enjoyable to play instead of this awful formula which I'm sure is very profitable for you in the short term. This type of game is the damnation of the industry.",1
,5
Use to play it on the pc. Even great on here!,5
How does this game have 4.5 stars. Its so bad. Worst case of pay to play ever. With games like this the mobile game market will always look bad.,2
Great game,5
,5
It is a fun role playing game,5
"Starts off fine then basically game forces you to spend real $$ just so u can move on in the game...reach level 3,Your stuck unless you spend $$$ on gems..and everything that cost gems is 100k+..I'm done.. Wasted money before I realize d I would have to spend more..don't bother",1
Like how mages are able to shoot though walls. I know there supposed to do this but it's really annoying like you need 4 or more walls an all sides of your heart just so they can't cheaply shoot at it from a side that's not as well defended as the rest. Maybe Make it so mages can't shoot though walls or maybe not be able to shoot the heart though walls... You can't have buildings next to your heart either or they well shoot it though the wall and capture it and then you lose.,3
Excellent game! 100% addicted,5
I wish people would make more of these.,5
Very addicting,5
Bad,1
Pay to play,1
I really enjoy this game. Its excellent.,5
,1
"It's fun for the first couple of hours. But as you play on you quickly realise how slow this game will be without investing some serious cash. What could have been a great game is utterly ruined by the greed of the developers. I would have been fine with passing $5 or even $10 once but this is just ludicrous. My advice, stay away. If you do decide to play, please refrain from rating it until you've given it a proper chance. It seems amazing for the first few hours",1
Awesome just plain awesome,5
Its nice to play Dungeon Keeper again,5
,5
"Fun, one of my favorite games.",5
It doesn't play long enough to enjoy it cause it crashes with in two minutes of playing. Please fix this.,1

Nice job ruining a good game by being greedy EA.   micro transactions ruin this game.,1

"As a long-time fan of the franchise, this app pretends to belong to, I am actually disgusted that EA would put their stamp of approval on this shallow money grab, claiming it to be part of a license they sat on for 15 years. The ""gameplay"" involves waiting up to 24 hours for certain blocks to be ""mined"", Farmville-esque cow clicking, and you can't even fight others in your own base, that mode sends you to another world, making the whole dungeon keeping thing a complete waste of time, like this game.",1
Interesting,5
"This kind of trash is what's ruining mobile gaming. This isn't even pay-to-win. It's pay-to-WIN. Save yourself the trouble and find something else to download. Shameful, EA.",1
"See for yourself like I did. You will go nowhere on this game or be anywhere, like a landslide difference, vs anyone who pays any bit more. It only takes about 4hs between doing a few tasks after you get through the 10 day beginning stuff. Don't waste the time unless you want to pay.",1
"Everything worked until i bought the $99 package, now my imps won't do anything.  Going to dispute the charges with my bank if i don't get an immediate response",1
Strange but fun,5
Need I say more?,2
"Good to see this game out of mothballs, I've been playing since the first one, then dk 2",5
"it's a money grab and makes the game unplayable, nothing new here, it's expected from EA.",1
"Where is it? It says that I have reached capacity, yet I can't find it.",3
Fun strategic planning to be the best dungeon master.,5
Great game to play while driving,5
,5
I is unplayable and uses to much micotransactions,1
Entertaining and addictive,5
Want to shell out 70 bucks to not have your game grind to a halt? This game is for you,1
I like the strategy in it. Fun game i find myself checking up on my imps ready to clear out more room for my projects lol,4
A really well made and addictive game. You WILL have to pay lots of money if YOU'RE AN IMPATIENT 4 YEAR OLD! Do not download if you hate fun! Or you're the above mentioned whiney 4 year old. Cheers!,5
If you are looking to buzz through the game it'll probably end up costing a bit of cash.  But for the casual gamer who plays here and there it is quite fun.  I just wish some of the build/mining times were a little faster.,4
Nuff said,4
,5
,5
Dark and fun,5
Good,5
Not normally my type of game but overall fun :),5
Way to many notifications and no way to turn them off. Uninstalled. Moving to Pixel Dungeon.,1
,1
Je,3
This game is great. Highlt recommed it for the Samsung S3,5
Is it a fun game? I don't know. I'm not about to spend a ton of money just so I don't have to wait hours for each step.,1
"I enjoyed the original, and now This app comes out. Great.",5
,2
Same,1
This is a good app version of an old Pc game I used to play very enjoyable,5
The game is fun but on tablets it is really laggy,4
Unique layouts,5
"Every week there are changes to the rules, and every week the game is modified in other for you to spend more money. Today's update has completely changed the rules again.",1
The game itself is fun but the wait times for upgrades and even mining is pretty ridiculous. 4 hours for a single block?! Also the early goings of the game gems aren't really required but become necessary very quickly and the costs become exorbitant.,2
,5
Its fun makes me want to find a copy of theoriginal again,5
Really fun rpg. Definitely a hit!!,5
Fun to play,5
Better room building needed,5
Nice,5
So far so good.,5
Please figure out a way to not have such long waiting times,1
Keep up the great work!,5
Micropayment hell...there's no reason why I would want to spend real world money to get anywhere in the game.  I barely finished the tutorial when I hit the wall.    I needed to buy real world gems just to get a third imp?  Way too expensive to upkeep.  Uninstalling.  Side note - I would gladly pay for a premium version if I wasn't required to do micropayments.  $10-$20 is a reasonable price for a game that doesn't require micropayment upkeep.,1
Awesome,5
Great game,5
,5
,5
It's another app designed to encourage you to pay and keep paying instead of being upfront about its cost. This is not a free game.,1
Kool game get it now!!!,5
,5
"I have missed this game. Really needs to have the spell where you can call all of your minions to a specific  spot, like in the original game.",5
"LOVED seeing this in the Play store! 90s classic made into an app. I can play again! :-) Stayed true to a lot of the OG PC game functions. Of course, now we have to wait to do anything substantial after 10-15min of game play but overall, very evil and very fun.",3
,5
Its Grrrrrreat,5
Awesome,5
Got the newest up date but still kicks me off.,1
"It was an awesome game up until the update deleted all my progress! If this is what happens after every update, uninstalled!",1
Fun so far,5
this is a fun game more games like this plz,5
,1
,5
Was looking for the classic version of this a few days ago for my PC. Was great to see a tablet version. Hope it's as awesome as the original.,5
"I loved Dungeon keeper,  dk2 is one of my favorite all time games.  I still play it and am excited for war for the over world to come out.  But this game is an insult to the series, the genre,  and gaming as a whole.",1
Can't get anywhere in the game unless you pay inordinate amounts of money. Or wait weeks. It takes the pay to win model to a while new level.,1
,5
This game is pretty fun and addictive!!,5
Always loved this game.,5
Not bad if they actually let you do more without paying.,5
I like the way that u can PS our minions,5
"If you love games which require no skill, thought,  strategy, or creativity, then this is the game for you.  If you love games which challenge nothing but your patience, look no further.",1

Well see,3

"I love playing this game in my free time, it is so addicting and keeps you wanting more!",5
Fun game,5
It keeps resetting to the beginning of the tutorial and I can't accomplish anything,1
Avoid.,1
Cool keep up the good work,5
Overall good interaction and game flows very well,5
Would happily pay once for a full version. I refuse to play games with micro transactions,1
,5
Don't like micro transactions though but still playable,4
U can't go rong with this game it's a (KEEPER),5
Different version of the same game everyone has played before,5
Fun,5

"Disgusting business model is killing an otherwise beloved franchise.   I wish pay to play would be done well, if at all, but this is just about the worst implementation of free to play that has been done.",1
Best dungeon Lord game this decade.,5
nice,5
"EA again offers a ""free"" game that relies on micro transactions. You cannot advance in this game without shelling out some serious money. Save your time and  money and skip this.",1
Pretty good so far!,5
The game wouldnt vBulletin worl all ot would do is pop up a blank screen,1
worst  tycoon game I've ever played,1
This game would have been great had I been able to build something good in less than a week. Typical EA fare.,2
Fun,5
"Being an avid fan of the original franchise, I was thrilled to get to re-live my DK days on a mobile platform!! I thought maybe by ""free"" they were throwing in more traps or units via IAPs. I could deal with that. Then I realized this was yet ANOTHER clash of clans clone with outrageous IAP prices for garbage gems. Awesome way to ruin my childhood memories, EA. You have dishonored the original game and defiled what little respect I still had left for you. Oh and all the 4 and 5 star reviews are from morons.",1
Enjoyably enjoyable,5
Downloaded hoping for a game similar to the previous Dungeon Keeper games but the gameplay felt like a Dungeon Keeper skin on Clash of Clans. This is a standard click and wait game unless you pay for gems. Slow load times on my Nexus 7. I spent more time waiting than doing anything fun. Uninstalled shortly after installing.,1
24 hours to mine one block????,1
,5
,1
Stalls out at 90% then force closes my Samsung media player,1
Only been playing a short while but its funny and fun to play,5
It saddens me that people think this is a good game. 24 hrs to dig a block or just pay... This is not a game.,1
The game is basically spend money to do anything,1
"This rating will finish upgrading to 5 stars in 5 years, or can be rushed immediately for a million gems. See you then, Keeper.",1
Cool,5
Absolutely useless in areas with poor or no signal. Downloaded it to play on a flight.,1
Coolg,5
"Just a little upset with EA because of all the micro transactions. Their main priority should giving us the best game possible, not making money. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY.",4
"Edit: the game is super money hungry.  Pay 2 play  Original: I always wondered why dungeon keeper stopped at the 2nd game for PC, but I am glad they brought the game back, is good to be bad once again.",1
,5
Ive played the game for 4 mins and this is already my favorite game I could play this all day!,5
great g.e to be played  y all,5
WIthout the constant cool-down timers there would actually be a good game here.    But the micro-transactions are ... [rest of review will be completed in 53 hours. (send $5 to see it today)],1
A bit of a cash grab in game but still a lot of fun to play,5
,1
,5
,5
,5
"It's nice to be able to set tasks and come back later, doesn't require constant attention.",5
I can only play for maybe 60 sec before it freezes up it sucks do not download,2
Fun and very addicting,5
Don't bother downloading this it's EA greed at it's worst. You have to pay or wait to do anything.,1
,1
It's a good game and fun to play but you have serious problems with server connectivity. I get disconnected every 5 minutes and then I can reconnect for another 10 and then I find that I've lost a portion of the progress I had made. 5 stars when server is fixed.,2
Good game but newest update turns your sound on even whem muted so the helper can say out loud you need to attend to your dungeon.  Really nice when working in the middle of meeting and it shouts out.,2
This is why mobile gaming is being ruined.,1
"Game with a nice flow and user interface,  easy to learm and more ineractive then other ""building"" games",5
No complaints so far,5
Great game awesome graphics,5
Do not download.,1
Awesomely powerful,5
The restrictive pay to play ruins it.,1
Makes you wait for everything unless you want to spend money,1
"Having a minion take 24 hours to mine one block is ridiculous, this game is nothing but a cash grab.",1
A soulless remake of a great game littered with microtransactions and insane wait times. Almost unplayable.  Fans of the original should avoid.,2
This is one of the many reasons EA was voted worst company in the USA two years in a row. Way to shoot for a hat trick EA. You suck.,1
,1
"If you leave the game for ANY reason it loses all progress, doesn't save, and takes your resources without letting you continue.  Waste of time unless you can guarantee no interruption when playing.  Whoever came up with this idea is an idiot.  The concept of the game is fun and has some promise to it though.",1
"Need to work on some things to make the game more fun, like lower prices on in game items.",5
EA's Pay to Play model is ruining gaming on a platforms. Vote with your wallet by not giving it to EA and help send a message.,1
It's basically a program that has you click and wait a few days. There's no game aspect to it unless you pay a ton of money to have any real pace.,1
,5
Similar to the other pay to play games like farmville.  Fun for the first day then a grind fest with no fun unless you dish out $$$.,1
The whole game is great. The only problem is the money system. They ask you to pay too much for something when you don't even gain an amount when you invade that scratches the surface. Not to mention that other people also invade you and take your stuff. It would take wayy too long to buy something good with that type of system. Please fiixxx.,2
"Is its stuck on checking for updates, which I'm assuming it's DRM anyway.",1
"As a diversion, its a fun nod to the older dk classics.  But if you're stuck waiting at the dentist, you'll still be thumbing through People magazines five minutes after starting the game up.  It tries to entice money from your wallet, but is never engaging enough at the FTP basics to make you care enough to do so.",3
Good fun game. Of course it'd be best without in game purchases,5
"The game is fun but after  some research this game is just an empty shell of what dungeon keeper was just so EA can cash in on a new piggy bank if it is restored to what it was,but not a copy Thats been striped of over 90% of what the game was will it actually be more enjoyable",1
,1
,5
This game is actually pretty fun and interesting,5
"Do yourself a favor: Don't download this game. (Especially if you recognize the name/graphics from the PC game.)  Imps are gimped: You can only give orders to idle imps, and inputs cost Gems... which require spending real cash if you want enough to get a third or fourth imp.  And that's only the beginning....  Walk away.   You're welcome.",1
Another prime example if a free to start game that quickly attempts to suck you dry. Can't wait for this model to die out.,1
Fun game to pass the time,5
Wish they would have just re wrapped the old one with new graphics,2
Not a game just a money sink hole. Do not support this kind of game design,1
Not bad but not great need work,3
"PAY to play, not free. Can't even get past the first few levels without having to pay.  And not as good as the real dungeon keeper games.",1
excellent command and conquer,5
Just give me the game at a set price,1
Wait to play or pay to play.  EA even taunts you in the game by saying money can buy time.  If you spend money on this game EA is laughing at you all the way to the bank.  0 stars.,1
"If you think dungeon keeper will be anything like the classic you are sadly mistaken. Barely anything to do unless you buy tons of currency. I played this game 4 days and still cant afford to buy 1 imp? I cant even design dungeons to defend because my imps cant clear the tiles in under a day. I buy games on my phone, but there is 0 gameplay here.",1
"People whine about the fact that EA has a way to earn money from impatient players.  You can play a perfectly fun game without paying at all. Don't want to support a good game, then don't.  Just stop whining that there are players willing to subsidize your game.",5
,5
Makes me chuckle while playing.. Lol!,5
,5
Took a good franchise and turned it into a dollar grab.,1
Yeah love it,5
All fun so far,5
Best game ever,5
Cool game,5
"The free to play store of gaming is tired. This game could be great, if that aspect was removed.",1
"I would rather pay 6. 99 for a full game rather than buy expendable jewels for ridiculous prices. It's made to make gameplay irritating when playing for free, forcing you to want gems to bypass time limits and get more builders. I won't buy gems though because I do not want to support a crappy game model. 99 bucks for virtual gems... Pathetic!",1
Dungeon Keeper is pure devious fun!,5
Terrible tactics,1
,5
"Like any other city builder, just has a new theme and skin. controlling placement of buildings and traps is incredibly infuriating. Nothing sets this game apart from the dozen other games available in this genre and worse then that is many other games do it better then this one.",2
Very addicting.,5
its all pay to get to the higher pay wall. theres no playing.,1
After two seconds I uninstalled and it will remain uninstalled until EA figures out how to un ruin it.,1
"When I started the 5th minion was 1k gems, then 1.5k, then 1.7k, now 2.3k. The price is going up faster than I can earn them.",1
Impossible to do much of anything without absurd waiting times or spending  money.,1
"DK is very well done, it's a fun, campy TD game. The problem is that progress grinds to a halt after dungeon heart 3 if you're not paying for gems.",3
,5
Horrible game.... All of the 5 star reviews are  because the game asks you to rate it 5 starts in exchange for points. Go read what the internet is saying about this game and how bad it is.,1
This is dumb at points and if my guys don't die why do they still disappear obviously people at ea like to make poop as usual,1
Used to play the old pc  version of this game and really enjoyed it.  This one requires you to pay way to much to really be enjoyable.  I'd rather   pay a few bucks upfront and actually have game play like the pc version.,2
Similar to the old PC game,5
Horrible example of in-app purchases gone awry.  Shame.,1
Just another Facebook style wait game. Dont bother with it.,1
"great graphics great music .lots of fun it is a timed game so sure, further into it more waiting well be involved,unless u spend money.but diffently gives u plenty if u use wisely:-P",5
A game that was made very well,5
Good remake of a classic.,5
Fun,5
,5
Best game iv played so nice minecraft,5
Free to play ruins everything,1
Can't get past loading screen after the new update.,1
To bad cant find my old game for pc,5
Looks cool but I can't even play. Something about code 17.,1
"Played for 5 minutes and the game wanted my money. Sure I could wait for hours and hours to do one thing, but that isn't fun. What happened to the old dungeon keeper?",1
But imps cost a little much,5
"The idea is great -- I mean, its Dungeon Keeper, the franchise was AMAZING -- but unless you plan on spending WEEKS or an obscene amount of money, prepare to lose interest quickly. The mines don't produce nearly fast enough to keep up with skyrocketing prices of level-ups, the gem rewards are single digits while anything worth purchasing is in the hundreds. EA and all other developers involved with this ""free to pay"" scheme are just getting greedy at this point. We had a great run, Dungeon Keeper.",1
"This isn't free to play, it's a ponzi scheme dressed as a game. Avoid.",1
,5
Fun,5
"Thank you EA for the privilege of giving you my money to ""play"" a free game. Which means paying so I can get to another level to pay so I can get to another level, ad infinitum.",1
Cool,5
,5
"I've been having connection issues ask day. It's this site to the update? Also, the notifications need to be turned off. That demon keeps making out bursts at work.",2
,5
I love it!!,5
,5
"Not actually free. I'm tired of these ""free"" games with pay to win functions. You can't do anything in a reasonable amount of time. Just go buy the original with all the extra content for 6 bucks for your computer. Far better offer for a far superior game.",1
Yes,2
"Installed this just to get my 2 cents in. Classic game ruined by greedy IAP. I'd say shame on EA, but this seems to be their forte now... For the record, this a  0/5 review.",1
,5
"It's a f2p game, so there are microtransactions. But demanding that I pay money in order to finish digging out a single block of dirt inside of 24 hours is just ridiculous.  On top of that is the ""Slap your imps to double their speed for 30 minutes"". This is designed to bring a player back every half hour and eventually wear the person down to spend real money to just finish a single order.",1
Fun gameplay and great graphics,5
"Fun, but it's a pay to play game. Expect to invest heavily if you want to unlock items in a reasonable amount of time. Not true to the games heritage.",1
Fun so far... could be a money sink though.,5
"Alot of hinting towards the game wanting you to buy gems all the time,and some of the time for mining is a bit long, but I'll play it for a bit and see i guess",3
,5
"Lots of potential for fun, if can afford paying to win",1
I enjoy this game.,5
This game makes you pay wAy more than it deserves to play. Do not download!,1
These type of games need to die. Ruined the dungeon keeper series. Thanks EA,1
This could potentially be a decent revival of the PC classic if it weren't so saddled with microtransaction nonsense. Save yourself a bunch of time and money wasted and just buy the old games on GOG.,1
,1
"It seems kind of neat initially. Haven't played very much so far  but, graphics look real good.",4
Just like old times,5
"gotta pay to play this game, not really free",1
But gems just ruin everything... This trend needs to end!,1
Good graphics,5
Advance your dungeon to unlock all new pay tiers.,1
I loved the original PC game. This poorly veiled pay-to-play nightmare is an abomination. Give me this game without the pay-to-play and charge $20 for it and I'm in. What a waste of time.,1
"I guess if you like playing games that take longer to progress in than you'll actually be alive, this game is okay.  Otherwise, I hope you make bank because you'll be dropping mad bucks on this steamy pile of feces.",1
,1
Too much 'pay to win'. Can't compete without spending $50+. Lifted all its mechanics from Clash of Clans.,1
Pay pay pay seems to be the chant for this port of a once great game. Developer Greed wins over substance.,1
The micro-transactions that are enforced make this game completely unplayable.,1
GREAT Game,5
Loved the original and it keeps fairly faithful to its origins. It's a shame that it's cropped by the pay parts and time delays. Hate waiting for crap.,5
"Dungeon Keeper was a fond part of my childhood so seeing it here had me a bit giddy. After playing this for several days I can safely say this is one of the more boring and least imaginative empire building games out there. The original Dungeon Keeper was fast paced and a full game all by itself. This thing takes forever to do anything, has some fairly backward rule sets, and of course includes the dreaded pay for gems to try and get you to spend hundreds on a game worth $10 at most. It simply isn't fun.",2
"I'm gleeful that this has been modernized into an app! I loved the PC version back in the day, and this update is awesome, witg the same twisted sense of humor! I love it!",5
Its an excellent game for passing time,5
This game if fun to play in my down time...,5
Fun very fun,5
I tried to like it but there wasn't anything to do when every little bit of it was asking me for real money. You only get two imps to start and they do all the labor so you could only upgrade two thing at once and it is all a waiting game. To take down some walls can take up to 24 hours. You aren't even evil really as the game makes me think. It is just so boring really.,1
,5
,5
,5

,5
A flate rate would be better,1
,1
If only gems weren't so hard to get. Also imps should be able to work on the same task together to finish faster. The pc version is definitely better.,4
"Microtransaction you to death, no real game play.",1
Awesome I'll be on this a lot,5
DONT GET IT SUCKS,1
If you want to spend 100$ to get past a pay wall then youll love this game. Other than that stay far away.,1
In order to have fun playing this game you must invest $$$$. I would rather pay a small amount for the app than get it free and pay to advance. Uninstalled.,1
Gave 5 bucks worth time,5
Complete garbage. This is spyware disguised as a game. It tells you it's spyware right in description and somehow people fail to mention this in reviews. The gameplay is uninspired to put it mildly. You can't put enough lipstick on this pig.... Is it any wonder EA is one of the most hated companies?,1
24hours to mine one square 275 gems to bypass $5 worth of gems to bypass one √üquare,1
"Only on mobile does it seem that makers can get away with the insane monetizations you see. Dungeon Keeper deserves better than this. The balance is such that you can spend days to weeks making absolutely no progess because you can't earn gems in reasonable amounts to get additional imps, you can only place one imp on a project and building restrictions force you to dig out to the corners through gem veins that take 1 full day per tile to break through. Or you can spend large amounts of money to buy gems",3
Nothing lile the old game. All it is now is a clash of clans type thing. Rather see dk3 come out..,1
Its a fun game to play. Based off of the original computer version. Its a great way to waste some time.,5
And not pay for every step with real cash. Thanks.,1
,1
"We'll see if it's any better than clash of clans, lol.",5
"Having never experienced the original game, I'm glad EA took the time to bring it to mobile so I can play it! I love how they took a $10 mobile game and given me the opportunity to pay however much I want to feel like a winner. I was getting tired of all the one-time purchase games that are too hard for me to beat. Now, I can shell out $70 at a time to load up on gems and crush the competition. Let's face it, losing its for poor people, but sarcasm is for everyone!",1
Great game,5
I lost all patience when an update happened I was at level10 then had to restart due to multiple attempts to correct the issue I got Fed up and hit delete...not worth  the time of that is gonna happen,1
Awesome,5
Great port to app!!,5
Its a fun game,5
"Be warned - the game will force you to either wait (Up to 24hours to mine a common rock) or pay a ridiculous amount speed things up. I wouldn't have minded to pay $5 for version without in app purchases, but this is just absurd.",1
"Run by cold calculating old rich dudes who only care about squeezing every dime out of the player as possible. This type of ""pay to win"" nonsense is going to ruin the gaming industry. STOP SUPPORTING THIS",1
Good,3
Thanks,5
Not really worth the time.,2
,1
Ruined a classic by forcing in-app purchases,1
,5
Needs balancing to be a great game,3
,5
Great classic game but EA ruined the dynamic by making you pay to play and then marketing this crap as free to play (with IAP).  You simply cannot progress or even play for a decent amount of time without shelling out real money for in-game currency.  EA have turned a classic game into crapware.  Download the original on Steam and play it on the PC.  Skip this title!,1
Great game to pass the time.,5
"At least 1,000,000 gems.  This game is a fun concept, it's a mobile version of the old DK games, with all the managing/challenge of creating the dungeon taken out.  It's a a ridiculous money grab. The tutorial tells you to use gems as often as possible, then when you check the price you realize how horrible it really is.  One star because it can't go any lower.",1
Easy to play fun to progress,5
This game is not free to play.,1
used to play on pc,5
"I was very excited when I saw this in the play store. I immediately thought that the original Dungeon Keeper was brought to mobile but when I started playing EA's Dungeon Keeper for android, it became completely obvious that they made this a 'free' game in order to attract many downloads and then afterwards rely on in app purchases (which by the way are extremely expensive). This i s incredibly disappointing and completely takes out all the fun of Dungeon Keeper.",2
Yay,5
,5
"There truly  need to  be rules on calling something ""Free to Play""  You CANNOT compete in this  game  without paying  an outrageous sum of   money, as per most of EAs money grubbing mobile games.  Do  not bother unless you're  willing to  shell out upwards of $40  a month to sustain your supply of crystals OR you have no intention being able to build a dungeon that can defend itself/attack any dungeon owned by  a player who pays.",1
Great game,5
A lot of addictive fun,5
fun game,5
"Honestly would have preferred to pay for a $4.99 game that was closer to the to the original Dungeon Keeper than this Free2Play bastardization.  Making any type of progress on this game requires shelling out ridiculous amounts of cash or.....well nothing, you need to shell out ridiculous amounts of cash or  time.  The only entertaining part is slapping around your imps.  And even that loses its charm.  As a touch screen version, the graphics are great, the interface works great, as expected and the sound when not on bluetooth is great.  When on bluetooth, the sound stutters.  All the good stuff is easily crushed by the gameplay crippling freemium direction they took with it.",1
,5
The original Bullfrog games. Trust EA to suck the life and fun out of your childhood memories.  This game could have been fun if they didn't go the freemium ware way and just make it a $5 funsie experience. Instead there's a lot of waiting around and not doing anything.  How is this fun?!?!,1
Until you pay them money to remove the annoyance for 5 minutes.  A shame because the original game was so great.,1
After playing for fifteen minutes the game the game slows to a snail crawl unless you buy gems.  At the point the game asks you build a 4x4 room and it takes 4 hours to mine 2 whole squares taking 32 hours to finish.  Please just charge me 8 bucks for this game not strangle me to death with in app purchases.,1
Great game,5
Horrible cash in on a classic game. This game is unplayable without shelling out a ton of cash.,1
"You don't really get to do anything in the game unless you are dropping tons of money into it. It's nothing like the old PC game, it's slow and asks for money every minute.  I'll try again with a memory editor to see if that gets me anywhere otherwise 1/5 it's payware.",1
Coollll,5
"Simple as that, just EA's trashy business model...",1
This game is fun nd intriguing,5
"How can people rate this 5 stars? It's an unplayable game, it'll take month and months to finish unless you were to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Do not bother people!",1
Looks like a fun game,5
Very well done.,5
"This game is nothing more than a poor cash grab. Timers are poorly balanced, gem unevenly distributed, and just not much fun when lacking any actual strategy. Your time is better spent elsewhere.",1
Its fun and creative,5
,5
I was excited to play a classic and thought it was too good to be true that I could play for free. I guess just like everything else now free only means they make their money by making their product barely work or by selling your information. I will be avoiding free from now on,1
Microtransactions destroy this game 's playability.,1
,5
Only if you wanna for a total of 5-15 min a day while you wait for stuff to get done. Stick to the classic PC.,1
"Awesome game, really fun",5
They really need to lower there prices on stuff our else they will lose business,5
"Absolutely abysmal, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.",1
It keeps ya entertained.,5
Adictive game,5
"You cant play this game without paying an exuberant amount of money. If you play it with minimal money, it plays like a Facebook game, you only hop in for a few minutes to reset the cool downs. And then the game asks for a rating, and if you don't choose the 5 star, it ignores you, giving you the empty email option. The tutorial is annoyingly casual as well.",1
Better than clash,5
So amazing,5
"Hilariously addictive with a wonderful layout, just started but Im enjoying the engine, def one of the best games for tablet that Ive found.  Keep it up guys.",5
Great,5
Good time waster,5
Ever since the update came out I can't play it. Every two seconds it keeps disconnecting me and then reconnecting me and it makes me do everything I just did over and over again. So I'm stuck in a never ending cycle. Fix it and ill rate 4 stars cause this ain't worth 5,1

Amazing,5
"Getting tired of ""free"" games that require you to spend more than $20 to be able to do anything. Also super pushy about getting a rating and downloading other stuff. The notifications yelling stuff at me was when I gave up on this though",1
"This game is the biggest downfall of EA. Everything that the original Dungeon Keeper games had down flawlessly; the pace, the creativeness of building a dungeon, the dark and gloomy environment, has been taken out and what is left is EA's attempt to make quick profit off of the name of an old cult classic game. It's good to be bad, but it's not good to be a bad game.",1
"Crashed and made me start over, I couldn't stand another go through the tutorial that begs you to use the pay to play currency.  Tried to spam my friends every time I started it.  Also downloaded updates without asking or even trying to use wifi.",1
Reminds me of a game I used to play as a kid!,5
Micro transactions are bit annoying but par for the course with this type of game.,5
Fun and good tutorial to get started. Slow stone and gold though...,5
Love this  game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-),5
Love it,5
This game is a joke. It likes to remind you every chance it gets to buy the in game currency.,1
Super smooth on my nexus 5 . Well done,5
,5
"So far so good. I just hope it doesn't become a game that requires 50bucks just to have fun, or any money.",1
,5
Micro transactions are brutal.,3
In game micro transactions required to continue game play.,1
,5
I started playing this game in PC. Love it,5
"At some point you hit a wall and it basically forces you to pay to move on or waste a ridiculous amount of time waiting. No thanks, uninstalled.",1
"Free to start, then pay out your backside for gems to progress. EA took a beloved franchise and turned it into a shambling automaton that eats money and excretes sadness.",1
,1
EA has taken a quality game and once again ruined it. DK now follows a very strict pay to play format when almost nothing can be done with the in game currency 'gems' please stop supporting games like this and spend your time and money on quality titles.,1
"I want to play the game now, not tomorrow.",1
"It's almost impossible to advance with out in game purchases. The main building goes from 7k points to upgrade to 50k, but with out any method to get those points within a  week without purchases.",1
,1
I like it so far.,5
It's not even close to the original Dungeon Keeper and requires to pay ridicules amount of cash to play it. Such a disappointment.,1
,5
"Good graphics, fun game",5
"I loved the original Dungeon Keeper games from Bullfrog. This abomination, however, is nothing but a desperate attempt to cash in on micro transactions. The strategy, humor, and simple interface are all hidden behind constant attempts to direct you to the store to buy part to win items. The gameplay is stunted by the forced time delays. This game is just horrible.",1
"A smooth interface very polished, graphics are very clean, gameplay is enjoyable.",5
"I used to have the game for PC years ago, brings back a lot of memories. So happy they kept it true to the original!",5
It's more like a retail store simulator except it takes you a day to get to the checkout.,1
"No point calling this free to play, in order to make any significant progress you will need to pay to move forward. This is a twisted version of a gaming classic where imps take literally days to carve out a few blocks, and everything inevitably moves to how many gems you have which you will need to buy.   Save yourself some time and play the original. That's actually a proper balanced video game, this is just a pretender riding off an old idea with paywalls everywhere.",1
I was a skeptic at first but wow what a fun game,5
"The in app purchases are ridiculous in this ""game"".  I'd rather pay for a game than have a free game ruined by in app purchases.  Even digging out rock can take 4-24 hours",1
Cool,5
,5
Everyone should have it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
I love this game,5
"Way to ruin my favorite IP, EA.",1
"Do not, for one second, waste your time on this abomination. A disgrace of a imitation of an amazing game.",1
Pay to win,1
Really like the game just wish it wasnt so hard to level ur stuff it takes forever,5
,1
,5
I can't stop playing this game. Its so good.,5
Pay to play at its finest.,1
,5
4 stars cause some times it doesn't load right and needs to reconnect but other than that its a game that can be played for months,4
,5
"After playing for a week or more with super slow progress because I refuse to pay for gems, my dungeon was erased. Way to go EA. You guys are steadily going downhill. Uninstall!",1
"It's free to start, pay to play.",1
"This game is just another one, in a long line of games that brand themselves as a 'FREE' game - when really you're just playing a time constraint mechanic and flooded with micro transactions. I don't blame developers for trying to make money, just try not to do it in a free game. Next time, how's about EA just make Dungeon Keeper Mobil and ask for the five bucks up front?",1
"If you want to have anything besides the first couple rooms and two worker imps, expect to either pay a significant amount of money or wait days to be able to do anything.",1
"This is not a game and only 'Dungeon Keeper' by name. 24 hours to dig a block of dirt? You literally have to pay to enable the basic pacing of this ""game"". All by design of course to annoy and beg you into paying hard cash for a fakery of Dungeon Keeper. Game play is nothing like the original and instead is more akin to a Tower Defense game. Raiding someone's dungeon? Well watch your completely uncontrollable minions roam around after what their personalities deem worthy of attacking. Please don't waste your time on this and certainly not your money. EA should be ashamed at this extortionist piece of crap they call Dungeon Keeper. EA has secured another vote from me as Worst Company of the year, lets see if you can win 3 years in a row! I'm not a human piggy bank, enjoy your Golden Poo award.",1

,5
Your game is fun but sometimes things take a long time,5
"I remember this game from when I was a kid and it's still just as awesome, even on my smartphone :3",5
Awesome,5
One of the worst examples of micro transactions I've ever seen in a game.,1
Really like this game. It's addicting!,5
Very fun,5
Great game,5
,5
Fun,5
"Another example of EA's money-grubbing. Just make a COMPLETE game, make it GOOD, and charge ONCE.",1
Its a cool game but the gems are way to expensive and hard to come by in game.,2
Burgundy,5
Enjoying so far. You just need to resist temptation.,5
It's very Dungeon Keeper-y.,5
Pay to win...come on EA...,1
,5
Love the game....,5
That's pretty much it. Just another pay to win game.,1
,5
"If not compared to the greatness of the original Dungeon Keeper, its an ok clash of clans clone.  You are limited to very slow build/dig speeds if you don't pay.",2
So far so good just started playing the game,5
"A very well done Clash clone. This game looks polished and runs very smoothly. It's a shame, however,  that they've taken a brilliant game and brought it to this. After playing it seems its only connection to Bullfrog's masterpiece is in name only. Play for yourself to see what I mean",1
A fun time-sink.,5
"Yeah, you stuck with the name....and that's about it. This really has nothing to do with that wonderful gem of a game. It's just a regular ""town""game. Call it ""Dungeon Town"" rather than Dungeon Keeper. Extremely disappointed.",1
Its a great game but the ones that came before were a little better the wait time seems a bit excessive,5
,5
"This game is more like DK1 then it is 2 but with much better graphics. I was a little confused at first but quickly caught on as I remembered DK1 but if you never played either, I don't think it would be hard to catch on. While I wish the would develop DK3 for the PC, this game has been great to play when I have some time to kill.",5
That is all it is. You have to pay continuously in order to get any sort of fun experience from it. Unless you enjoy pressing a couple buttons every other day and that leaves you satisfied - avoid this.,1
Nice demon type defense game.,5
"I really enjoy this game, don't get me wrong but I have a few concerns, first of all the cost of imps, I understand you're trying to make money but 800 gems for a third imp and 1000 for the next is just insane, yes this is a freemium game but you need to at least give a chance to players who don't want to spend cash, it would literally take months with just 2 imps to access the outer resource sites and months on top of that to cut out a proper dungeon I'd say a third cheap imp at least is needed and I'm out",3
"For all appearances it looks great and could have been a fantastic game, but you just can't play it because of the gem system. You are constantly waiting for this or that to recharge, so the gameplay is stutterstep unless you want to fork over a hefty amount of cash. I'd be fine paying $15 for an 'unlocked' full version, but that would only net you 2-3 imps in this game. Sad. An expensive ripoff of the most popular 'game' out now, skinned to sucker in the nostalgic crowd.",1
Worth the download.,5
I've had this game long enough to review. The honeymoon phase has passed. Nostalgia gone.  This is unbearable. I even bought a few gems to see if I could get to a point where I wouldn't need anymore if I just used them wisely. Wrong. If you don't use gems you get gridlocked in upgrades. Clash of clans is at least playable without gems. This is a clone of that only worse. I only play now because I don't want my money to go to waste since I bought gems.,1
I think they should just add the ability to earn free gems in the next update,5
I love this game,5
It's my fave 90's game for mobile!  Awesome!,5
,1
Or not play to advance,1
"I will always have fond memories of Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2. Pretty much in every area they were fun, this game has gone and removed or changed what was fun about it. Changing everything so much so that it had little to so with it predecessors.",1
I don't want to sign in to an account to play the game. Sorry. And if I want to pay $50 for in game currency I might as well go buy a new x-box game or something.,1
,1
"Awesome game, I loved playing the pc versions of this when I was younger glad to see EA bring it to android hopefully they will come out with a DK 3 on pc soon till then I will be hooked on this!!",5
4 hours to break a rock? 24 hours to break a rock?  Microtransactions fuel the game so that you aren't waiting a week to build out a 3x3 square. Stay far away.,1
Great game ruined by micro transactions.,1
Awsome game,5
,5
"Always randomly freezes out of nowhere, then i gotta restart my whole tablet, cause it wont work anymore",1
"While I wanted to like this game I just can't.  You can't get beyond level 3 without paying.  Now, I understand this is a freemuim game, but pay to win is different than pay to play.  I would rather pay $5 than have the required microtransactions.  The gameplay is good, just as it was in the 1997 game this was ported from, but the restrictive model is just a deal breaker.  Sorry DK.",1
Played the computer game love it,5
"Great franchise ruined by greed.  IAP games aren't bad by definition, but this game is slanted so heavily toward purchases that you can't enjoy more than a few minutes of playtime before running out of stuff to do. . . Unless you're willing to spend of course.",1
"Never played the original, but this is fun, certainly a great diversion to Clash of Clans",5
Very addictive!,5
I love it,5
"And this is no exception. Taking an old IP that many loved and whoring it out to nickel and dime you to death is not exactly a new low for EA, it's just what you expect from them. I didn't believe it could really be as bad as everyone said, but it really is.  You have to pay ""gems"" (the rarest and hardest to come by currency that you can buy with real money) to get through the tutorial, unless you want to stare at the hand pointing at the ""rush"" button until the task is completed.  Unplayable trash.",1
This game is awesome,5
,5
Awesome,5
Love it!!,5
"So not only is this basically a pay to play version of the original, but now instead of a full refund of resources we will only get a partial amount back? Add to that the fact that we can't swap traps? EA you definitely messed up big time. You not only lost a player of this game but you now have someone who will also be boycotting you on the xbox/playstation front as well.",1

Thanks for ruining a great game.,1

"A great Android crossover!  All the elements are still here, great game.",5
,4
Seems good so far,5
"I love DK &  DK2 so was jazzed when I saw this until.. To dig out a square of soft rock 30 sec,  rough 4 hours,  the next one takes 24 hours. And any minion you use in a raid is not returned to you when you win. All in all seems like a cash grab",1
"A pretty fun game, but it's based around micro transactions. The fact that breaking a block can take up to 24 hours unless you pay really shows that...",3
Awe sum,5
"Very good game and looks great! But like, 1 day to Mine to mine 1 block is ridiculous!!! And it is just dumb to charge that amount of money for gems. Your an idiot if you pay for that crop! You can buy a new xbox game and have 30$ left for what Yall are charging for stuff on these games!",3
"Spend all your time collecting, without a way to protect, and lose it all to a raid.",1
Fun yo play,5
Its cool and all but wierd,5
The pc version of this will never be beat.. its ad that they went and made this pay to play instead of letting people enjoy what it use to be,3
,5
"Bullfrog/EAs classic reborn... into some almagimation abomination. Not anything like the original given the time to build.EVERYTHING, which I hate, and makes the game take longer without being interactive... basically a clash of clans w DK units...",1
,5
Takes 1 day to mine 1 slot for 20 gems. Not Nearly enough free gems to make this game useful...all rewards for progressions together couldn't buy me a third imp. Worthless game until they improve free play.,1
"Conceptually and graphically, this is a pretty cool game. However, as much as I'm already not a fan of in-app purchase models, the crazy expense of gems and the absolute hopelessness of this game without buying them is at a whole new and preposterous level! Expect to pay HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS! Seriously...I've played a bit and done the math. In fact, there is a $100 option in the store for gems...and not only is that a reasonably necessary purchase to play this game, it wouldn't be enough! The only way I imagine this pricing model could even work is to prey upon enough people getting addicted and not noticing how often they spend $20 or $50 to keep going. As much as I dislike in-app models in general...this one is so incredibly unreasonable it puts EA into an entirely different league of greed and brand mismanagement! Oh...and did I mention? The expensive boosts to abilities and treasure collection are good for a few days to a week only...then you'd have to pay for them again!",1
How can you people give this buggy garbage five stars?,1
Free to pay not free to play.,1
Very cool game,5
"EA has taken a wonderful classic game and turned it into a money-grubbing grind. Were EA to release a full version of this, I'd pay $7 for it. But this is garbage.",1
Game has great graphics you will ingoy,5
,5
Good game,5
It a little differ then the PC version but I enjoy this new one as much,5
I usually don't like these types of games but the fact that you have a demon with a cool voice guiding you is pretty cool.,5
Funny game let's you slap your imps to make them work faster lol,5
Like the game so far,5
,5
,5
Higher levels of the Bomb Wall  spell (two 5x5 areas) renders any strategy for defense obsolete.,1
"Borderline scam, there is no game here, it is just a money sink. Every action is going to cost you real money. It isn't even fun, just grinding and breaking your wallet.",1
I get that it's free to play. But the game pretty much requires you to buy gems to make progress. Or wait a full week to make enough room to add a room. Just not entertaining.,1
Really good game,5
,5
,5
Nerver got so addicted to games like this before,5
Great gameplay for a mobile game.,5
"I can't say is a perfect port from the old game... But as an app, it's truly solid. Much love.",5
I enjoy the graphics and concept. Lots of fun.,5
Hellllllll yesssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
It is an insult to the original.,1
Un intalled and done,1
Great game it reminds me of the old game.,5
Micro transactions ruining a fantastic franchise.,1
This game is great and its funny I love the slap stick humor it has,5
"They hook you on the game then after a couple days you realize you  can't defeat anything, defend yourself, or build/upgrade in order to increase your chances because you have no resources. In fact it takes resources to upgrade to be able to store enough resources to upgrade. Akin to building a bank just to deposit another $100.  I quit,  I'm not paying greedy EA a dime... Did the same thing with plants vs zombies 2.",2
"The pay walls make this ridiculous. I would have easily spent 10$ on this game. Nope. No more micro transaction crap. Great graphics, game is still as fun as it was in 1997. Minus the purposeful roadblocks put in that hinder your fun and force you to spend 80$ on a stupid mobile game just to play. Keep your crap EA, I'm reclaiming partition space.",2
"After the update yesterday, the game would make noise after a few hours of not playing. I thought it may be running in the background so I made sure to close it completely. In the middle of the night it burted that my imps await my return. Honestly to be woken up by this game in the middle of the night is a little creepy. I'll install it in a few weeks and see if its fixed. Was cool until that.",1
Awesome game,5
"Operating Is kind of hard on the phone, every time I try to zoom in or out I end up digging where I don't want to.  Other than that it is just like the computer game from a long time ago. Good to have it back.",5
"Much like the DK of old,nice nostalgia.",5

Free to play model that kills a fan favorite franchise,1
One of the best Free games I've ever played,5
"Having a lot of fun with this game, thank you !",5
Since the latest patch I am now unable to play the game on a Nexus 10. Right after the EA/Mythic logos the screen goes black and stays that way. Please fix soon for better rating.,2
Very entertaining and interesting,5
This game is a lot of fun,5
Game is too restrictive in levelling up.  Too bad because the flavor / personality of the game is really great.,2
,5
"Microtransactions abound in this otherwise entertaining game.  I'd gladly buy it for a flat $10, but I'll never pay a dime for this.",2
Every time I open the game it restarts me as if I never played. An the can't skip the how to at the start is annoying.,1
,5
Guilds won't load. What gives?,4
"Was so pumped when I downloaded this game.  Until 3 mins into the game, I realized it was freemium.  Way to go EA, way to go",1
"Without the in app purchasing of green gems, building later in game takes on average of 4 to 12 hours.",3
,5
"If you loved the original PC version of DK, do yourself a favor and avoid this game.  Your memories are far better than this annoying prattle.  It's like DK met Webkinz.",1
Loved pc version this one is just as good,5
"We live in an age of tablets, phones and other powerful mobile devices.  Unfortunately we also live in an age where this passes for a game.",1
"I begin to understand why it says optimized for tablets. This is because on phones, if you happen to sleep with it nearby, it will send notifications at any time. One moment you're sleeping, the next the dulcet sounds of the keeper awakens you to let you know that ""x-something"" has happened. It's a fun concept for about ten seconds, but I ended up having to turn my media sounds down just so I could sleep. I tried to find a settings button, the usual gear image went to links for facebook, google, and the terms of service. I tried to use the usual android option (multiline bars) to find some settings and nada.  Notification settings or volume control or something would be an awesome addition for those who might need it. Thank you. In the meantime, off from my phone. Not because the game isn't fun, but because I gotta have sleep.",2
Its a very original game,5
"This is a very fun time waster, build/raid type game. The only thing I hate is the gem system. You can win paltry amounts with the achievement system, but past that you have to buy them. Something like 14,600 gems for 100 bucks. 100 days of premium is 10,000 gems, every hour you rush a building is like 10-12 gems, anything past level one on anything is multiple hours, you could build an okay base an get a buff for 100 days for 100 dollars. That's kind of ridiculous. Who spends over 20 bucks on in game cash?",3
Awsome!!!,5
I loved the original PC game.  I hope they put in a single player element.  I would pay for that!,5
Didn't enjoy it at all.. terrible game.,1
Like clash of clans but better,5
Only played for about 30 minutes but great so far!,5
"Entertaining , fun, and engaging!",5
Easy to learn interface and terribly addictive.,5
Fun little time management game.  Only trouble is they expect you to spend money of get gems.,3
,1
Just my humor,4
Coll coll,5
"I was hoping this game would be great, and the tutorial was, but when I went to name my dungeon, the keyboard didnt come up and its stuck. Fix and I will play again.",1
I enjoy,5
Good gameplay + animation,5
Unique twist on a defence and resources management game. Tons of fun!,4
Great graphics,5
Excellent,5
Good game,5
this game is so fuuuuuunnnnn it is worth geting,5
Virtually unplayable unless you're willing to soak big real bucks into the 'game'. So sad since I fondly remember the original.,1
"Even when I have good Internet connection the game disconnects, and when it reconnects, it starts the game over. Also, the price of gems is way too high. I wouldn't even pay half of the prices being put forward.",3
,4
Also the newest update speaks the notifications with no apparent way of turning sound off. I work in a professional environment so I guess I'll be uninstalling.,1
"Still a clone of a dozen other games.  New enough and different enough to be fun by  adding rooms and the dirt.  Albeit limiting the strategy, increasing the need to pay and slowing you down greatly.  These IAP or pay to win / speed up  apps are getting just outrageously ridiculous and needs to go back to the old free. Free with ads, to free with pay to remove ads OR paid apps.   These micro transaction based games are just disgusting in the greed they show these companies have.",2
,5
,5
Possibly the best game I have played on my tablet,5
Like Clash of Clan but a dongeon,5
Good graphics & sound. Requires internet connection making in-flight play unavailable. Bring back a stand alone version that I can play anywhere & I will likely buy it.  I'm uninstalling this version.,3
,5
Fun game,5
I used to play the online game and I have to say this game kept alot of its features,5
,5
What I love about this is that it's funny and a dungeon keeper game!,5
I love the graphicgs and it be cool if you could update,5
Game wont start. I tap on it and it says checking for updates for like 5minutes straight,1
Pretty cool  little slow on my phone,5
Ez to upgrade and great graphics..,5
Was a great PC game. Limited on the number of imps makes game play slow enless you spend real money,2
"Loved DK when I was younger. While snarly comments retain the feel, the game itself is unplayable. Unless you want to purchase gems the only way to play is to wait through an unreasonable loading time, send your two imps to work, grab the resources, maybe do one raid, then log off until your imps finish their job. Without the raids it takes about a minute. No time to enjoy the flavor. No time to take pleasure in the sending of imps to work. This says free to play, but it is only free to watch a timer tick.",1
,5
Only 15 minutes into it but it is very fun.,5
Fun fun fun.,5
Everything is the same as Clash of Clans. Even all of the resource icons are in the same place!!,1
No comment needed.,5
,1
Great way to waste time.,5
,5
Awesome,5
Let me buy this game. Don't offer me $100 in gems.,1
Another limited freemium game that requires so many micro payments to get anywhere. I would have gladly paid for a full game of dungeon keeper which I enjoyed on the PC but not this.,2
You pretty much can't do anything without gems and those you pretty much have to buy.,1
Good fun. Worth a download,5
"Wow this game would be so amazing without all the microtransactions.  But no, this is a streaming pile of greed from EA.  I feel sorry for you folks that actually pay for gems.  Uninstalled.",1
"I love this, I use to play this back when windows was still new lol I feel so old....",5
OK,5
Great game.,5
,1
I'm enjoying the game but better ifi can buy it outright,5
"More than I expected, throughly impressed.",5
,5
Addictively fun and funny,5
Love it,5
Rings me of the original. Happy I found it,5
I played the original two and loved them this is great as a time killer,5
Great game though,4
Slow starting harvest amounts but great early raiding payouts to balance this. Great job guys!.,5
"Its pretty good, everyone tries to be like clash of clans, but its been done they cant. STOP TRYING. This is one of the very few that didnt fall flat on there face. My god...  ....im a tomato.",5
,3
:-),5
I saw the name and got excited. I remember the pc classics. Only to find out they try to suck every bit of real money out of u. I selected a green rock to dig. 1 little square takes 4hrs the other green squares take 24hrs each. Unless of course u spend real money to speed it up. its something like 500 gems to instantly dig a 24hr square. 500 gems is I donno. $5 or something.  dont think so. Charge me $5 or even $10 and give me the whole game.. not playing this pay as you go BS at these prices.,1
Haven't been playing too long but if you're a fan of strategy games this has been very fun and entertaining so far.  Highly recommend to give it a try!,5
Awesome,5
Cool,5
"It's a very good game, spend most of my time on it",5
Takes me back to the original,5
,5
Im impressed. Great gameplay. And its comedic.,5
Just another attempt by EA to cash in on old IP by making a mediocre game and filling it with IAPs... Bullfrog would be ashamed to have this game related to their games,1
"Game had potential, but I'm over this pay to play model. It would take a month to fully build a dungeon for free.",1
I like being the bad guy,5
,5
Its great if you liked the classic game.,5
Good game,5
Cool and stuff,4
"Had this game on my computer, it's a bit different but still fun",5
this game is awesome if you like Castle clash you will definitely like this game. I'm enjoying myself with this game very much,5
Can not load the game so you get one star until I can load it,1
"This isn't a 5 star game.  It's not a 2 star game.  This isn't a ""Free"" game.  If you think it is, then you deserve to be parted with your money.  This app, needs to know everything about you.  Why?  Why does a video game need to know anything about me at all.  It doesn't.  From the start, it encourages you to spend the in game currency to ""rush"" things.    Imps do work w/o actually having to be there, so things don't actually do things, timers do.  Even with out ""micro"" transactions this doesn't hold anything to the original it's based off of.  This is about as close to the original game as McDonalds Monopoly sweepstakes is to the actual Monopoly game.  The worthless currency is going to cost you more then if you went out, got a nice steak and lobster diner + drinks for 2.  Or you know, you can insta-build something in a game.  Don't waste a moment with your time with this game.  If you want a GOOD version of this, one that the original creator has blessed seek out War for the Overworld.  You want to know how bad this game is, look on the internet.  No one actually likes it.  Just watch some YouTube videos.",1
Have not played since I was a boy,4
"This game could be fun but, it has far too much waiting. Twenty four hours of mining by one imp on one square and very little reward.   The true currency in this free to play charade is actually your cash, you wI'll be more than encouraged to spend it on gems, it's pretty tragic. Advancement is so slow that three days in, I have very little progress to speak of. It's too bad, DK2 was awesome, this... This is whack.",1
Greed has taken over.,1
"Having been an avid player of Dungeon Keeper on the PC, I was very interested in discovering a mobile remake.  While the fact that EA was publishing it made me feel sad for the thousands of puppies and kittens murdered in a black ritual as their tortured cries undercut the cracks of whips on the backs of the unpaid developers, I wondered, ""How bad could even EA have made this beloved franchise?"" Well, no sooner had I started the game on my tablet than some kind of electric shock leapt from the screen to my head, rendering me unconscious.  I don't know how long I drifted in that hazy world, but when I came to I woke in my bathroom, in a bathtub filled with ice, with a note reading, ""Call 911"" on my chest in what I can only assume was my own blood on account of the fact that my blood seems to be in abundant supply in the tub with me.  I seem to be missing at least three organs at the moment, maybe four, I'm not so sure about my liver.  Please send help.  Please.",1
,5
Good twist on most kingdom games,5
"Making any significant progress in this game will cost you money. Otherwise, actions like excavation, building, and training just take FOREVER. Slow and greedy.",1

Cool game so far.,5
Such nostalgia Much imps So wow,5
"It will become rapidly apparent  that if you want to actually enjoy this game you will have to invest in EA's endless micro transactions. 4-24 hrs to dig through a single tile, two at a time unless I pay? Ehhh...I have better things to do, like play classic dungeon keeper.",2
Fun Fun.,5
This game is really good and easy to get gems,5
From the very outset of the game. They encorage you to spend gems (obtainable by real money) to perform just about every action in the game or wait. This either makes you dole out money in the fistfuls or play at a pace where nothing get accomplish. A promising game ruined by a greedy business model - I would much rather pay a upfront fee to play this game rather than have to put up with this level of micro-transaction abuse.,1
Love the evil and it's fun,5
The demon dude is very funny. Good game.,5
Pretty fun so far.,5
Great strategy game,5
Total let down....couldn't keep a constant internet connection long enough to do  anything....didn't even get t to the IAP that obviously ruin it anyway..uninstalling.,1
Awesome,5
,5
So much fun to play I recommend it for avid mobile game players,4
"When I saw this I got excited, I love it! Just what I expected from an updated version. Hope to see it make a return to pc someday",5
Nice graphics. Entertaining control of minions,5
Every time I try to get past the intro part where it shows you how to play. it restarts all over. it seems like a fun game but can't really play it if it keeps doing that.,1
"As a fan of the original DK I was excited to play this, despite it being free. I would rather pay for this game than to waste another second waiting days to tear down a single rock block.",1
This is a great game. Time consuming. Only issue is the cost of gems for Imps,5
"Nothing like previous dungeon keeper games. I am a Huge fan of them. This however, is a transparent in app purchase money grab scheme. And to add insult to injury, it sucks as a game even when you still have the gems it starts you with. I am extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time.",1
For the biggest chunk of gems (140000 at $70) it will let you mine out 56 blocks.  No thanks not anymore.,1
"It may be called Dungeon Keeper, but it plays just like any other freemium cash grab p.o.s. I loved the classic Dungeon Keeper, and this is game is not even a shadow of the frenetic and varied gameplay of the original.",1
Paly on pc its fun,5
,1
"I was a huge fan of the original PC game...one thing I loved was the ""intimacy"" for lack of a better word with the minions...this version of the game sacrifices that in the worst way. Instead of having to wait for your imps to get to the wall before it starts being dug the counter just starts...as if the imps were irrelevant to the process...instead of slapping them around on the screen personally you bring them up in a disconnected panel and smack them all at once reducing the act to a contrived strategic",2
,5
"I remember playing the original pc game, Dungeon Keeper, and absolutely loved it. This modern free to play take on it does the original game justice.",5
"$100 best value? Yeah right . . . if I wanted to pay good handheld games, I'd buy 2 3DS games for that price, and still have money to spare.",1
Game ruined by microtransactions.... Shame on u ea,1
Nice,5
,5
Amazing nuff said. Now go get It,5
,5
"Amazing graphics.  Good pace, ignore players who want faster production games are ment to last not play for s week and be done it's a casual game not a one time thing. I'll be playing for months to come.",5
Micro transactions and long wait times galore. Don't even bother.,1
Fun and hilarious gaming,5
I think it is Avery great game to play had fun playing it?.. LA due DA!,5
,5
"Is a good throwback to the pc versions, though the pc version is best.",5
,5
So far so good,5
"Pretty fun game, I haven't a gotten very far but it seems fun",5
,5
Good ole dungeon keeper with a twist. Love it,5
I love these reverse defense games. And this one has the best of both worlds... and the voice acting is hilarious as well,5
,5
Sucks,2
Sweet,5
Fun game but as soon as you get farther along the game grinds to a halt. Having the choice to either wait hours for an action to complete or pay for it to finish quickly is not my idea of a fun time. I don't like micro-transactions!,1
Good,5
Great game so far,5
"Free to wait this was one of my favorite games back in the day but it has been completely gutted. No snide clever remarks no sense of urgency no thrill, or rush, only the feeling going through my daily commute and a 24 hour wall is blocking the way.  Whose gob stopping idea was this?",1
Just started playing but its keeping my interest pretty good and it doesnt appear that greed doesnt limit your experience,5
The game is unplayable I lost the ability to click on anything after update,1
Just as slow to get resources and the same style of play.,2
This game is pretty fun until you realize digging a medium block takes 4 hours and a hard block takes a whole day. This can be a great game but the wait time is holding it back.,3
Excellent Super fun to play,5
This game is funny and fantastic way better than most games 5\5,5
,5
,5
The only problem I have with the game is that the imps are too much. Otherwise awesome game.,5
Great,5
Fun,5
The interactive demon guy is cool ... Ha I gave it 5 stars cuz you did a pretty good job on gameplay .,5
After 2 days of playing and an update I found my game missing and started me back to the tutorial things like this need to addressed and I love this game on PC very disappointed,1
,5
,5
Nice pass of time and is well made,5
I like it. Just whag I was looking for,5
Fun,5
"Micro transactions.  Everywhere.   Game is unplayable unless you pay a lot of money.   Not worth your money or time.   Devs, I'm sure you just did what you're told, but your bosses suck.  Bring back the classic! I would pay for the game once, just not 300 times.",1
Nice,5
,5
Fun!,5
,5
Great time killer,5
Nice game,4
I love this game feels good to be called keeper in a deep voice,5
"""Game"" operates fine, but the amount and constant nagging for the pay currency impedes possible enjoyment.",1
Overall great game,5
Love this game.,5
This is a disgrace to the old dungeon keeper games,1
Good game,5
"Used to give five stars.  Game is too hard to play at higher levels without buying gems.  Upgrades are too hard to get,  makes it too hard to carry on.  Raids allow someone to take too much of ur gold or stone.    There is only random p2p.  I want to be able to raid and play against my friends too.  The soical aspect of this game needs much work.    Being able to close a mine would be handy as well.    Time stamps in the chat would be nice as well.",3
"Unfortunate DK is nearly impossible to play - it disconnects regularly even when I have a strong signal and aren't having issues even with video streaming on other devices.   Plus, an average of 3 out of 4 times when I try to connect it forgets about my progress so far and tries to restart me at the beginning. What's up with that?  Disconnects often happen within a few seconds of loading the game so it's difficult to collect resources and start new tasks before getting bumped again. Plus it happens regularly while I'm raiding another dungeon which means I lose the minions I've deployed plus the gold I spent to start that raid without gaining anything from the raid.  The game itself isn't compelling but isn't bad. However, loading time and connection issues are so bad that I can't give it more than 2 since it's effectively unplayable nearly all the time. (For context, I'm in San Francisco and on Verizon with stellar 4G-LTE service or on wifi with great connection and speeds sitting still.)  I feel bad dissing Mythic's work like that, but if I can't play the game I can't give it a good rating.",1
This game is actually pretty good so far. At the same time I feel like it could be a lot better on a console.,5
Comment,5
REALLY  GOOD GAME SO FAR,5
It is much fun to play!!!!!,5
The push notifications started being loud and got me in trouble. Couldn't make them silent again.,2
,5
Great Bh,5
Fun,5
The tutorial presents a very different game than what you end up with. Once the game gets going you face insanely long wait times unless you are willing to pay real money. I have no  problem with in app purchases when done well but this is the antithesis of well. It is a gouge the entire way. Shame on EA for truly running this game with such an egregious model.,1
,5
Even after update the game still isnt working :(,1
Great time waster.,5
Good game. Loosely based on the original game from 95.,5
Great app!!!!!,5
,5
Great,5
Classic,5
Love the that it's different,5
A d&d spin on clash of clans archetype very nice game,5
,5
,5
"As above, so below. The need to buy crap isn't overwhelming but will become apparent nonetheless. That being said, core game is free. Can't beat that. A little bit of learning curve, but obviously highly polished.",5
,5
Based on transactions!,1
5 stars,5
"This is the worst cash grab ever.  EA has taken micro transactions to a whole new level.  Do you want to dig a hole?  Wait 24 hours OR pay $1.99.  I would have paid 10 - 15 dollars for an ACTUAL game that didn't have the all this pay to win, rip off nonsense.  They have completely ruined the Dungeon Keeper franchise.  Please save your time  and DO NOT download this game.  It is time to boycott EA.  Disgraceful.  Utterly disgraceful.",1
Should have been called something else. Most definitely not Dungeon Keeper I grew up with.,1
,5
Just make it easier to drag stuff around the world,5
It's a really good game and its fun to,5
"It's a good game and I love the little jokes. Only complaint is the cost for imps. Too expensive. Also after googling it, apparently they're cheaper for other people? Really?",4
"So at no surprise, EA has taken another great title and reduced it to a steaming pile of refuge.  Stripped of all the fun and mechanics of the original it is only sharing the name and nothing more.  Riddled with micro transactions and waiting.  You will only open the game to tap a few things only to close it and play something else.",1
I usually don't like games like these with the raiding and stuff but this game got something more special than greed for glory or clash of clashs that I love...,5
Was very excited to see DK return. That was very short lived however. Great concept but waiting hours for a task to be competed unless I'm willing to pay doesn't make for an exciting game.,1
Great,5
THANKS,5
Great game,5
,5
Similar to the old pc game,5
Ok I enjoy the game but seriously it gets worse and worse not only does it keep kicking me out of the game when it apparently has a hissy fit and shuts down NOW since last update I can't even get into it??? Plz fix asap or I just remove it!,3
Fun and engaging. Reminds me of Evil Genius,5
Fun and very addicting!!!!,5
,5
,5
Great game,5
,5
"Yeah, so there was far too much waiting during this game. I mean, one of my two imps was constantly digging gems, trying to find enough to buy another imp so I could tie up two in gems, which meant I'd only have one imp free to actually do things. Unless you are willing to pay. And continue paying. If you're not willing to pay, it takes weeks to build a dungeon. It isn't even fun. And it certainly isn't Dungeon Keeper.",1
,1
"I use to love this game, it's awesome that there is a mobile version now..",5
,5
Better then the other games of this type,5
"How I lament the loss of the old, REAL, EA. When they made real, enjoyable GAMES and not these cynical, greedy, micro transaction ""freemium"" excrement filled cash grabs. I would have gladly paid $50 plus for the REAL Dungeon Keeper. The one that was actually FUN. Please vote with your wallets and make these jokers return to making actual games. PASS.",1
This is a travesty.,1
,5
Love it,5
Fun fun fun,5
I've played the original and this is just great!,5
,1
,5
Why is everything Oh you want something faster give us money. I mean come on that is like some one holding you hostage saying Oh you want to play sure pay us.,1
Sweg,5
Pay to win masked inside a free game.,1
,5
Loved the games on pc and happy its mobile now,5
"I'm getting tired of this freemium system running wild, the game is intolerably slow to get going unless your money or your patience are long. Really love the idea though, huge dungeon keeper fan just pick up the pace!",3
Fun little game,5
Brings me back to the old CPU game. A lot less confusing and more fun. If you like RPGs and castle defense this is the game for you,5
Very smooth and very clean graphics. Gameplay is top notch!!  A true gem by EA!!,5
"!,,",5
Simple yet stylized and true to original while still adopting modern app based micro transaction gameplay,5
Constant crackling is very annoying,1
"Not exactly like the old game, but worth the play. Disappointed when i found out EA had turned my old favorite into a pay to play game.",5
,1
Addictive as hell lol something different,5
"I like that DK is back. Was hoping it was like the PC game but not really. You lose your minions when you send them on campaign, that sucks. It takes so long just to dig up gold or gems. I hope that changes. I'm still playing though.",5
Yessss,5
"I want to play this game...I really do. But, it costs a fortune to play.  If you don't buy gems it takes hours upon hours to accomplish anything. In some cases it's takes a full day just to mine one block.  EA's greed is sickening.  The original DK was great, this is not. Please don't give one cent to EA.",1
,5
Sat around way too long trying finish tutorial. JUST LET ME PLAY AND FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF!,1
"Wow, what tards are saying this crap is better than the pc is just utter stupidity. Did those people that are saying that ever play it. Probably not since theyre 10 years old. More garbage mobile games that ruin the memory of the originals",1
Great for killing time,5
Good gme,4
,5
,5
,5
"Please don't play this game. The main problem is if you want to advance at all you need to pay. You also have no control over the minions besides spawning them. If you are interested in this type of game, then get the original Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2 on the PC. Both are less than $10 on GoG. Please don't let EA milk you on this game when you can pay much less to get a full game than the same amount just to mine out one room.",1
Okay,4
"Fun, very well made,  engaging,  actually pretty funny.",4
Love the way u get to control everything,5
,5
I love it,5
Should start with 2 imps free.,5
,5
Excellent work from E.A.,5
,5
Just started but is really going well. Lots of fun.,5
Good game like graphics,5
Very fun,5
,5
"Great Graphics, interesting approach to TD!",5
,5
Eciting,5
"This game is a joke and a slap in the face to the original. I grew up playing Dungeon Keeper and loved it. I was so excited when I saw it as an app, then realized I'd need to sell my blood merely to access the most basic aspects of the game. Do you really need MORE money, EA? Considering you didn't even originally design this game, the answer is NO. When your company steps down from the kingdom of micro transactions, maybe you'll have my attention again.",1
,5
Sweet,5
Great revamp of a great game,5
I enjoy playing this at any point during my day!,5
Really fun and the graphics are also good.  Runs smooth on my S4,5
,5
Love ItB-),5
Can't spend any real length of time immersed in game play. I wish I could pay a flat price and just play through the campaign like in the original game that I miss so much.,3
,5
"I got did connected from the sever 3 times the last time was in the middle of a raid and when I was able to reconnect I lost everything all my gold, all my stone, even all my buildings and minions.",1
Brings bzck some great memories..great job on multiplayeR r addition.good job ea keeping the feel of the ORIGINAL MESSAGE. .Thanks for bringin this classic back,5
"The rate of which the gold mines and quarries are too slow and mana production not to mention the rate of how minions are produced, the only actual way for a beginning player to actually ""enjoy"" this game is if they can have an easy start and production for quarries and gold mines to get faster as you get a higher level and minion production to get slower per each minion with higher level. Hopefully its fixed during the updates. Until fixed 3 stars",3
"It looks and sounds nice. It's a slim and space conscious install, and runs smoothly.    As a game it is an abomination and a sad bastardization of its namesake. This is a freemium model game whose free components do not prove engaging enough to merit their paid counterparts. It is essentially a poor Clash of Clans clone with a Dungeon Keeper skin and more insistent pay to win reminders.   It's depressing, and frankly insulting to DK fans or anyone that enjoys actual games. Avoid.",2
Love this game Lot super fun so glad it in the play store way better than the PC version Very happy,5
,5
Always good to see the horned reaper,5
Cool,5
Good game,5
Great game,5
Very fun.,5
Incredible,5
Everyone who's played the original DKs knows how disappointing this game is.,1
Good game,4
"And please don't waste your money. This game is riddled with overpriced in ap purchases and as many time walls as you can imagine. This game had a lot of potential,  but it simply goes on the list with sim city for blatant money grabs",1
Yeah!,5
"I'm ashamed to download this game the micro transactions  and the 24hour waiting time ruined the game I watched nerd¬≥'s video on this and‚Ä¶ really ea?!? This is just stupid what's with the micro transactions its almost 70 pounds for f*** all amount of gem things, and to all you people that put 4 and 5 stars are you f*****g retarded like WTF is your problem either you don't understand games or your just a spoiled brat urg it annoys me to look the reviews and see the 4 and 5 stars, and I'm done with this",1
Incredibly addictive game. So far no pressure to buy either.,5
"This isn't a game, it's just a micro-transaction scam to bilk money to play. Simple tasks either take 24 hours, or you have to pay real money to proceed at a reasonable pace. Don't waste your time. Especially don't waste your money.",1
The gem system is broken and  times to mine are dumb,3
I'm so sad.,1
Nice installed on my phone also,4
"EA has taken the concept of an tyrannical overlord subjugating their minion population quite literally with a microtransaction model design to squeeze every last dime from consumers. The game is an interesting take on the beloved classic but deformed and distorted due to the malicious pricing model.  $99.99 for gems...listed as the ""best deal"" is hard for any keeper not to flash their fangs at.  This is one we are all best to avoid until EA can improve their business model.",1
Seriously? What happened here? I was so excited to play again and this is what we get?,1
.,5
Goid game,5
"Good times, just need to be patient.",5
"While the gameplay is fun, it is greatly hampered by the time it takes to build things and the cost of everything in game. I would rather pay 5-15$ up front for little to no wait times when mining rather then have to fork out cash every time I want to play the game at a normal pace.",2
"Dungeon keeper badly needs an updated revival, but thus isn't it. Other than characters it's nothing Like the original. it's just the usual Facebook wait-to-play ""game"", with resources severely limited forcing you to either spend exorbitant amounts of money to keep playing right away, or play for two minutes and come back every few hours just play for another couple minutes. It takes longer for the app to load than the amount of time you'll play.",2
Brings back memories,5
"Overall, pretty fun game. A little tough starting if you don't spend money. Makes it take a long time to do things, but at least you can still do it. Not quite as fun as the original PC version, but definitely worth the free download.",5
Love it,5
So far enjoy,5
Nice remake.  Hope theres plenty of added content in the future.,5
Yo :-),3
Addictive great game,5
"Very slow play. Digging takes forever... Or you can pay for speed. Feels like the whole game is just grinding. Try to find a copy of the old PC game, it was actually fun.",1
Wow Very awesome!,5
Well made,5
Fun and well thought out I expect the community to expand rapidly.,5
It is fun if you like playinv games where you can grow towns and such,5
Fun to pay,5
This game looks amazing but the push for you to spend money is too much. I did the tutorial and went to go dig my first block.. 4hours????? Really? Or spend 50 gems.. total crap.. I can see spending $10 MAYBE on a cool boost. But $100 on gems that you will use up in a matter of minutes?  F*** that.  uninstall,1
Awesome strategy game,5
This is a great remake.,5
Ever since the last update the game doesn't start. It's stuck on loading screen and I made sure I have the internet connection too.,1
Easy to pick up and play,5
,5
,5
Its fun so far and haven't had to spend money to enjoy.,5
"It's impossible to progress in this game without first shelling out cash for gems. Log in once or twice a day, click a few tasks, and wait until tomorrow. I'm hugely disappointed since the original Dungeon Keeper was so much fun. F U EA.",1
,5
This isn't Dungeon Keeper.. This is another clone of games similar to Clash of Clans.. This game is a disgrace to the franchise..,1
quit crying nothing is free anymore.,5
,3
Awesome,5
,3
Took what I loved and bent it over the in app purchasing table.  I would have gladly paid $10 for the original Dungeon Keeper ported poorly to android.,2
,5
I updated and every bit of my progress on. Very uncool,1
Awesome game,5
Like clash of clans but with dungeons.,5
Cool,5
,1
,5
Took dk and added the free to play. Horrid combo. Go get the original dungeon keeper on gog.,1
Reminds me of the pc version,5
I like the game!!;-),5
"Mythic is awesome.best made tablet game I've ever played. Edit: to hell with micro transactions, -2 stars.",3
Most Coolest game ever,5
Really enjoying the snarky tutorial.,5
,5
Very fun and takes time a way,5
Awesome,5
Really sad,1
"Somewhat fun, but it can take days to do the upgrades you need. That is, unless you want to pay a ton of money to ""rush"" them. You cannot play this at a normal pace unless you drop hundreds of dollars.",1
,5
Game forces you to buy crap to continue.,1
Close to the original. I would like a pay-once price.,4
I played the original and enjoyed it for hours.  This version looks to be even better.,5
Fix it. You know what I'm talking about.,1
Being a clash of clans devotee I really enjoyed the feel of this,5
They just want money!,1
"So slow, unless you're willing to pay more than a non-""free"" to play game would cost. It's a scam, please don't reward them for it. There is a reason ea is consistently one of the most hated companies in the US.",1
,4
,5
Good way to pass time.,5
,5
Your minions are ready!,5
Its fun being an evil demon raiding other dungeons its very satisfying,5
"I'm really feelin' this right now. As far as I can see, the game has a lot of micro transactions for convenience and time saving, but the f2p features are great in and of themselves.",5
This game has a good twist on the tower defense/raid games. Keeps me coming back for more. It has IAP but what EA game doesn't now-a-days. The good news is that so far o e does t need IAP to have an enjoyable experience.,5
Good,5
Just started and I'm having a lot of fun,5
Similar to the old title of the same name.,5
I am really enjoying this game!,5
,5
Awesome,5
"Good fun,  hours of gameplay, and great quality. But hard to progress without spending money.",1
,5
:-):-):-):-):-) Much fun,5
Addictive,5
Fun,5
EA.. why do this to a beloved memory of my youth? Good  game but the micro transactions and prices associated are just completely ludicrous and unfair! I would literally need to spend hundreds to compete.  Time to break out dk 2 and remember the good days,1
I grew up with the PC games and now its mobile..!!,4
"Profits!  Every game that you guys have your grubby hands in has some ridiculous scheme involved.  This is no different with the fluctuating gem cost on imps.  At first imp 3 is 500, then he mysteriously jumps up to 800.  I pity anyone foolish enough to invest in this.  I will vote with my wallet by keeping it shut.  Tis a shame, you had a good thing going...",1
"You can't ""reset"" the dungeon. I f'd around in the tutorial and now I'm stuck with the results. Pretty much useless to me now. Also the micro payments structure is really not well balanced. Expect to pay. Lots.  If/when the reset is fixed I'll revise up. If/when the in-app purchases are structured more reasonably I'll revise up.  If both were fixed it would be worthy of 5 stars - it's otherwise a well done game. (though not exactly true to it's name sake)",1
Just great,5
Sweet,5
Great rebirth of a classic,5
"Had a little glitch with tutorial at first, got it fixed, great game!",5
"Loved the old one, and this one is nice so far. I haven't felt pressured to buy anything yet, so I don't get why people are so negative about the microtransactions, but it would've been nice just to have a full game at a flat price.",4
Also try clash of clans,5
Waaaay cool,5
Different kind of base building game. Its funny and entertaining,5
Hell yes! I love dungeon keeper..i hope this version is good   ::Warning players::..When attacking a dungeon your minions will be lost wether they live or die...Also when u select a spell it will cost mana even if u hit cancel and don't cast it...also..i love this series and my heart sank when I saw all of the micro transactions...i would be willing to pay $10 for a perfect port of DK for my phone..i happily payed the $1.99 for the carmageddon port and it's awesome....oh.....EA made this...now I see...booo.,4
,5
Fun stuff,5
I IS EXCELLENT,5
The amount of time it takes to do anything kills the fun out of the game.  I would rather pay 4.99 than have to wait 5hrs to to dig out one block.  Very bad design.  Would not recommend this to anyone.,1
I usually don't like these types of games but this is diffrent,5
,5
"Not quite as good as the original games. As it takes a lot more time to do anything. Also, it's player vs player. So I understand that things have to change to create a balance. But I agree that they go too far. You have to buy gems in order to stay sane. So I'm probably not going to keep playing this for much longer. Good try guys, but keep trying.",3
Ridiculously engineered transaction system.  This game is why mobile/tablet games will never be anyone's primary source of entertainment unless you live on a train like a hobo and have nothing better to play.,1
"Very good game, keeps you entretained for a while, and the devilish setting is unique.",5
,1
I can't connect to the game!!,1
Crashes upon opening :(,1
"What I like about this game is you have to show that you care about your workers ""Imp"" by hurting them but hey don't get me wrong. Try it and look at there faces and you tell me that isn't funny.",5
great game just like the original will be playing this game for a long time definitely recommend to others,5
,5
"The game is awesome and entertaining. Sadly, i only get to play for about fifteen minutes per day because of all the pay walls.  I play a lot of ftp games, but this game doesn't do it ethically.",2
Game,5
Game to play,5
"If you make a game make sure it doesn't crash, uninstalling now",1
,5
"Really cool game, runs smoothly and perfectly",5
If you've played the original dungeon keeper games I hope you vomited on your phone. Sick of EA's greed.,1
Funny,5
Great game. Love it,5
Cool,5
LOVE IT,5
Fun game,5
Great classic,5
"Such an obvious cash grab by EA. The free version is asininely long to do anything, and the game is too simplistic to consider spending money on.",1
,5
Keep going,5
Brings back memories,5
Pretty cool,5
,5
,5
"Far better pay to win babysitting games out there then this. They lured me in with the dungeon keeper name, nothing like the real one. Its horrible...",1
Used to play on pc I've been waiting forever for this to come on mobile and it finally has so amped!!!,5
Fun,5
,1
Its a really fun and unique game,5
Rather pay the 5 bucks and get a full game then be harassed to purchase constant upgrades. Waste of time for me.,1
I played the original games and thus is actually pretty cool,5
Good game so far vary fun and great tutorial already can tell I'm going to be addicted  Galaxy S4,4
,5
Ok Thank .,5
"I was a huge fan of the old Dungeon Keeper II, and this has really captured my attention. Fantastically done!",5
,5
Its pretty good and all but I can make a guild without 200!!!!!! Gems and I've only got 15 so now I'm stuck from progressing unless I BUY!!!! More gems,2
"Game would be great, if everything didn't take 4hrs to complete. Your only option is to buy more gems.",2
I love it wish minions were cheaper,5
"When I first got it, it wouldn't play right. It would sit there and I have to turn my phone off n on off n on. It's madness!",1
,4
A game I can start on my phone and finish on my gallery while maintaining all my progress. Nice work EA!,5
Almost like the old school game. At least give it a try.,5
,5
Can't even start the game it takes away all my gems,1
Having a blast,5
Gwa,2
"A store game like so many others, but unlike many this one has a charm about it.",5
"I enjoyed the computer version of this game, but it's just a awful pain to even start this game due to it keeps on crashing on me & giving the error code 7 or it just stops for no reason on why.",1
,5
Best freaking game ever,5
Transactions. Boo.  Seriously though I don't find games like this fun. Play for 5 minutes and wait 1-2 hours to be able to do anything else or pay which I will never do.,1
Fun to play and passes the time,5
Not fun. Ruins the name of the original games.,1
Really  cool and fun app but I do wish that it didnt take 4 hours to mine a second layer.,3
Easy play and lots of fun,5
"This is the most disgusting money grab I have ever seen.  If you want to play dungeon keeper the way it was meant to be played, go buy it from GOG for 5.99.  This mobile version, while it has great visuals, is completely unplayable unless you are willing to shell out hundreds of dollars an hour.",1
Enough with the free to play micro transaction nonsense. I don't mind paying you money but not when you tie it into gameplay. Stop it! You ruined another great IP.,1
,5
Very awesome!!,5
Great game!!,5
No really...you took an amazing game and murdered it. I truly hope whoever decided to make this game micro tansaction bases gets fired and never finds a new job,1
Good fun!!!,5
,5
Simply the best game ever,5

Fun,5
"DK was my favorite game growing up, and Mythic is one of my favorite game companies since DAoC. This is a nice trip down memory lane.",5
,5
This game is fantastic. The gems mechanism borrowed from Facebook games is far too greedy. You earn them so slowly and so few at a time and upgrades cost hundreds or thousands of gems. Buying gems becomes mandatory to even play casually. Pure greed. After trying for 48 hours to play this game I can say that I will never buy/try another mobile game from EA again. I'd have payed up front for the base game.,1
,5
"This game is pretty good, or at least it has the potential to be. However, the microtransactions, and the game mechanics related to them (long building/mining time) kill a lot of the fun.",3
I am now horribly addicted to how fun this is. Cant remember that last time i played something else,5
"Waaay too many microtransactions.  I'd be more than happy to pay one lump sum for a game with no time limits, and normal xp progression. I'm really disappointed in EA right now. They ruined one of my favorite games ever. The graphics, while not what I was expecting, based on the original, were okay. -sighs- And I was so excited too.",1
Had trouble with it running in the background at first but now is all right.,4
Ugugu,5
Had lots of fun.,5
Ok so far,5
Great game,5
Its an amazing game its fun and its easier to get gems then my other games good graffics and it makes me want to play it more,5
Just play it,5
EA could do so much more with this franchise rather then turning it into another clone. EA once again showing there ineptitude to produce games.,1
DO NOT SPEND A SINGLE PENNY,1
Expensive,5
Boooo.,1
I use to have this game on my pc...,5
This game is quite fun and clever I would say. It reminds me of Clash of Clans on steroids,5
Awsome game,5
Pure microtransactional trash,1
Pathetic,1
Good times very addictive,5
Pay to win games are the bane of gaming.,1
"I LOVE not being able to connect to the server! I haven't even seen the menu yet! Such an amazing game, but the title is misleading. I recommend the title to be ""error code 7"".  Edit: an update? WOOO!!! Solve any problems? Nope! Giving up now! Uninstalled!",1
"I have a droid RAZR HD max, which is a solid fast.  Loading the core app takes 10 seconds, check for updates about 15+ seconds, then a loading screen for another 20! And the game unloads in a heartbeat if I switch apps, answer the phone, or I put my phone down. I have to stare at it for a full minute each time, just to smak my imps in 1 second and close the app.  I dread opening the game. Eventually just uninstalled.",1
Kinda like clash of clans but with a demonic feel to it great game,5
"Great little raiding game. Horny is silly, love it.:-)",5
More ea trash,1
Computer version was more involved but this is still fun. Not found of it always asking me to login though.,4
Wow,5
Disgrace to the original dungeon keeper,1
I updated my game today and now my whole game data is erased and I have to start from the beginning.  Fix this and it deserves maybe 3 stars,1
,5
"Good game, huge pay wall to get anywhere. Terrible for a game with a great legacy.",4
Good game just wish i didnt have to spend so much on traps and stuff. Requires lots of patience,4
To long to load/update!,1
Just buy the original. Don't contribute to these micro transaction games.,1
"This could have been good and it was at first. There were very few needs for gems and acceptable waits for higher level buildings. Now mid range anything takes days and it is literally impossible to obtain a fair number of achievements without paying real money for a ""free"" game. The in-app purchase creep needs to die and here is a good start.",1
!,5

,5
"Just installed and updated.  WON'T CONNECT TO SERVER.  Will change rating if i can play the game.  Will try tomorrow, if it doesn't work ... deleting... Day two.. checks for updates fine, load profile from google fine, STILL WONT CONNECT TO SERVER.  Sucks there cant be an off line mode....Day three, game did an update,  game loaded my google profile.  GAME DIDN'T CONNECT TO SERVER.. This sucks.  Make an offline mode.  Tomorrow i uninstall the game.",1
,5
Badass,5
fune to play to pass time,5
,5
But EA come on you now have all of us trapped in a pay for resources loop!!,5
"The AI of your minions when defending your base is ridiculously sub par. They'll be in the same room with invading minions and not engage them. You'd figure if your base was under attack your minions, regardless of placement, would seek them out. That's just common sense, and something this game is lacking.",1
"Fun, cool game to play when your bored!",5
Easy to follow gameplay and highly addictive.,5
"This is not the Dungeon Keeper you remember. I wouldn't even call it Dungeon Keeper. This cash grab of a game drags DK's name through the mud. Why does every game need to follow this awful formula? Don't download this crap. I can't erase the horror from my memory, but I hope you won't have to experience it.",1
G,5
It is a shame that new gamers will consider this type of shallow time locked pay to win style of game as the norm.  Mobile games have a long way to go if they want to be anything but fleeting fads.,1
Yo it's pretty good,5
Legondaiy,5
This game has all of the amazing gameplay as the original,5
U guys really need 2 back off the money scheme. THIS IS A CLASSIC RuInED by your constant billing needed 4 a player 2 get ahead! I will pay 4 the fullest but 4 now my play stops. Im waiting & I know many more are also. Do it. Oh thats a negative 1 btw,1
,5
"What did EA do to Dungeon Keeper?! First, they made it cartoons then added micro transaction. I'd rather fully play for this game than this micro transaction BS.",1
"IAP system that ruins an OK game, data collection that would make the NSA proud, and nothing more than using gamers nostalgia for an amazing franchise as a cash grab. Way to show you deserve the moniker bottom feeder ea. Once again you have shown us game companies based solely on profit are evil.",1
One of my favorite games on pc and so far it's held greatly to my expectations,5
,5
I love  this game! It combines building with plundering and that is an awesome combination,5
"The graphics are nice, but this isn't really a mobile Dungeon Keeper so much as a pretty Facebook-style game.",2
Awesome history of the titles name. Cheap & sorry attempt @ picking your pocket. Bullfrog Blasphemy,1
Asome,5
"They don't care what you think. just give them your money, that's all they want. this game is a bust. it could be so fun. but eveything takes forever. 4 hours to take out a wall. 24 hours to take down a hard wall. wtf. i played this game a total of 10 times. meaning, i turned it on. did 2 things which took up all of my imps and i was done 30 seconds later. had to come back 4 hours later. this game sucks and its no fun, i wouldn't spend any money on something like this and i hope everyone else follows my lead.",1
Great game even though I downloaded it cause of the PC version I played as a child,5
This game is horrible I expected to relive memories but all i got was what seems like a clash of coans rip off nothing in this game has to do with the original,1
Not a bad game just getting started so got my attention,5
Ammmaxing danbull,5
"EA is scum. There should be a lower rating than one star just for this ""game.""",1
Awesome,5
Great game reminds. Me of CoC and real easy to start off,5
,1
"Game play is different than the original games, but decent enough.  Most actions take the imps hours to perform, so much of game is spending a few minutes managing imps between hours of waiting for them to finish.  Game needs to start faster.  Frequently it takes more time to log in than I spend playing.",2
,5
,5
Good,5
"I'm not gonna tell to you to move one, please install this awful app and give it a 1 star rating... it's the least you could do if you care about video games and or dungeon keeper.  Dungeon Keeper is another casualty of EA.",1
Brutal,5
Fun and easy game play,5
Great game play cool graphics but the game keeps freezing and giveing me a code 7 message and keeps restarting fix the freeze and ill give it 5,5
Love this style of game,5
Fun so far,5
Great game,5
"Game has so much potential to be fun and interesting, but is completely ruined by the need to spend exorbitant amounts of money to progress in even small increments.",1
so far so good,5
Uses tricks and promises of free content if you rate it five stars.  Should be removed from Google play,1
Esta bueno,5
Awsoma game,5
"This is frankly an insult to the Dungeon Keeper name.  The 2 dungeon keeper games were innovating, fun games that would suck you in with their great visuals, dark humor, and innovating game play.  This is just yet another freemium game like all the others of it's kind polluting the mobile game market, and to make it worse it tarnishes the game Dungeon Keeper by doing so.",1
Read title,1
I dont rate games i dont like but this one gets five stars its perfect for me i love it,5
,5
Grafics,5
Play Dungeon Keeper 2 on the PC. Then never play this scam again.,1
Great game!,5
LOVE IT!,5
Charge $10 for the app and get rid of the Micro transactions.,1
Want EA to milk you like a cow? Go ahead and download this.,1
,5
This game has good graphics and I is really entertaining with a sense of humor. Worth downloading,5
Installed and wouldn't update..just hung forever...uninstalled..starting to get tired of EA cash grabs though,1
This is awesome,5
This wins the award for the fastest I've uninstalled a game after trying it. You'd have more fun staring at a blank phone screen and tapping randomly every once in a while. At least a blank screen won't constantly ask you to pay money.,1
,5
Thanks for the best .       For     For,5
I love the game :D,5
"It's a lot like castle clash, but I stopped playing that b/c wait times for building things got to be too much. This is another fun one.",5
A shame what ea did to a nice great series. Riddled with micro transactions any respect for the players is long gone.,1
I love tower defense and this one gets me my fix lol,5
What the hell we're you thinking when you got the rights to this game. Good way to butcher a cult classic. do yourself a favor and quit your job and do your hobby you might do better at that. I will never buy another one of your products ever.,1
I'll provide an update after some more hours wasted!,5
Good mechanics and funny,5
Nuff said,5
"My guild dissappeared. Please help, the name is ""Lethargic""",5
,5
Much slaps So keep Must Imp Many Update,5
Jump from a few seconds to 4hrs then 24hrs to dig just so you can beg for money?,1
Great fun.,5
,5
"Good graphics and fun game, but almost as soon as the tutorial is done you hit a 4 hour wait if you don't want to pay. You can't even increase your workers without using the key pay resource. Terrible implementation. Cut the micro transaction push of making me wait for ridiculous lengths of time and I'd even pay for the game. Now I won't even play it.",2
"This game is really fun, don't get me wrong but these little purchases to help grow your dungeon are ridiculous! There are so many and the diamonds needed are hard to come by through actions in game. If you play this game please don't support this type model. Micro-transactions are ruining otherwise good games....",1
I love this game it reminds me of my childhood!,5
Best game ever,5
Boots,5
"I loved this game back in the day.  I would rather pay a one time $10-15 for the class, but everything that comes out now is based on micro transactions.  It's still enjoyable and for that, it still gets a good rating from me.",4
Cool graffix,5
Game,4
"Boring, constantly throws gem buying in your face. Zero gameplay, zero fun. I would rate it 0 if i could.",1
Fun,5
,5
Great game but would rather pay up to 8 bucks for a normal passed game that doesn't require me spending hundreds to be able to keep pace.,1
Fantastic job.  My only gripe is the IAP.  I would just rather pay for it.,5
Cool game,5
,5
,5
Pay to despair on how bad games are getting.,1
"If you have been on the internet recently you have realized that this is a  monstrosity. Also, never trust EA. Ever.",1
I love the jokes,5
"5 star reviews? If you pay any of these micro transaction games, you are part of the problem. Awful. Embarrassing.",1
Graphically stunning. Addictive gameplay with multiplayer and endless solo play.,5
A more family (and short attention span) friendly version of an old favorite!,5
Exciting from the start,5
,5
Yup,5
I have been waiting for years for this to come out! I loved blizzards 95 original dungeon keeper and this is as close to that game as you can get. I am in love and addicted all over again!! Thank you EA for bringing this classic back! However please bring back the metal music introduction!,5
The freemium model turns what would otherwise be a fun game into a crass cash grab. I'd gladly pay a lump sum for a normal paced solo progression and a level pvp playing field - which is all it would take for me to give this 4 stars.,1
,1
GET IT I ROCKS GET IT NOW PLEASE GET IT PLEASE,5
Fun so far loved the PC game I am hoping this one is better,5
This is a fun game and very entertaining! Well done,5
"I am a fan of PC version,so honestly i would played this one because of pure nostalgy. But after couple of first tiles it takes 4 hours to dig next _one_ or pay money. one room is at least 9 tiles (usually more).",1
BENJAMIN BENJAMINGMAIL,5
"Awesome game play, really good character interaction",5
Something to pass the time and really enjoy,5
Sick,5
This game is nothing like the original. The whole micro-transactions feature ruins the gameplay and the prices are outrageous. What ever happened being able to enjoy a game without having to pay extra so you don't have to wait to proceed further into the game. Make an exact port of the pc version without micro - transactions. This game is complete crap alongside any other game with micro-transactions like this.,1
I just started playing and I like what im seeing,4
,5
Still learning,5
,5
I enjoyed these games tor the computer was disappointed when it was discontinued hope this brings them back.,5
"Just the appearance of this ""game"" makes me think EA hasn't played Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2. It has little to no resemblance of it's predecessors and the fact that you have to pay to get anything done in a reasonable amount of time is ludicrous. Do not download.",1
,5
Check out the DR rap lol,5
This is an excellent game. Its as addictive and as fun as the old PC game.   I think EA has a winner with this one.,5
Very fun game to play.,4
"This takes me back to when I played Dungeon Keeper on the PC. Great childhood memories. Now,I can play it right off my Droid. I am also gonna get the PC Game for my computer again :)",5
"Uninstalled 5 minutes into playing. Money required for everything, and the game lost connection to the server and lost all the progress I'd made so far.",2
Try it. It's fun!,5
Like the graphics and all the cool monsters.  Mostly I love slapping the imps,5
"Smooth and easy graphics, runs very well",5
,5
"""Hurry up and wait"" is the real name of this game.  Ridiculous amounts of microtransactions or tons of waiting around ruin what was once a great title.",1
Love it,5
"I want to like this DK as it's got the quick and charm but it's hard in the present state. The ""wait timers"" are absolutely ridiculous and way too long. Just hit players with a 4 hr wait after what 5-10 minutes of play just to dig out a wall? How about a 24 hr wait on another wall? Please adjust the timers to be fair and comparable to similar games out there. IAP are ok except acquiring more Imps outside of only having 2. Hope to eventually improve rating.",2
All you need is money and you too can be a winner!,1
,5
This game is ruined by the greed of the publisher. You should be ashamed of the in app purchases you have added.,1
"Used to play this on my computer back in the day, nearly flipped when I came across it this morning.",5
Installed the application after several attempts.  The application does not open on my tablet.,1
Download n try nice graphics n fun pretty easy to start hard to master,5
I remember this game from back in the days of bullfrog. Great remake. You should remake theme hospital!,4
This is what great gaming has been reduced to ... pathetic.,1
,5
,5
Step one after the tutorial? Wait four hours to dig. Lol this is terrible.,1
I love this game.  I was looking for something like this,5
Ok,5
Nice change from the average city builder.,5
"This is a terrible excuse for a game, especially using the DK name. It's a money vampire of a game...",1
,5
,5
,5
"As with many games, especially those being put out by EA,  do not fall for the idea that this game is free to play. It isn't.",1
,5
"This is the biggest scam ever passed off as a video game. Don't waste your time downloading it, and don't even try to play it.",1
To do anything in this game you have to either pay money or wait hours. It is not a game,1
Awesome game,5
"This isn't free to play, this is destroying gaming as they fill their pockets with cash. Boycott this garbage and get Dungeon Keeper on Gog.",1
I played this game years ago I am glade it's on my phone now.,5
Good game I'd like to see it  further its gameplay with more advancements,5
Thanks,5
"24 hours wait times you quickly realize that this title is just to generate money.  I would paid money for just Dungeon Keeper 2 on a tablet, but I won't pay to quickly mine a square.",1
The ridiculous need to have to spend money to even make the simplest task doable.  Hate this game EA its fairly obvious that you are bleeding money and you are sucking dry your customers to keep a float!,1
"Thanks EA, you made a good title. But you got greedy. Workers are expensive, and premium currency is hard to come by. Make the gem payout for digging higher, we should at least be able to get 3 workers easily...",3
I have been waiting a long time for another dk. Nice job EA!,5
Congratulations EA.  You have earned one star.  Additional stars can be purchased at $99.99 (Best Value).,1
Walk away,1
Happy,5
This game is stupidly fun,5
,5
The game is unplayable without in game purchases. Nothing like the original game.,1
,5
"Micro Transactions make this game impossible to play through, the fact that it takes up to $70+ to make the game playable... that's more than a full fledged console title.",1
Hellyeah love this game,5
,5
"EA managed to totally drain all the fun from this classic game by adding micropayments for everything, requiring you to play in little drabs on their schedule, and completely removing the ""dungeons are attacked by heroes"" element.  They have sucked the soul out of this game and are parading it's evil reanimated corpse in front of us to taunt us.  I'm going to download the original from GOG and play that instead.",1
Reminds me of the good ole days as a dungeon master,5
Awesome and fun,5
,5
This is the worst thing to ever happen to Dungeon Keeper. Is the same trash as all the other terrible cash grabbing cow clicker garbage that is being peddled as games these days.  Don't get this game.  Don't pay them a single cent. Maybe eventually they'll lean to make an actual game and not just a horrible pay-wall/pay-timer filled junk that's so popular today.,1
Awesome,5
"Love the game, but also wondering if you guys will add S Pen support for Note Users.",5
Koop sh.... love seeing something bez7des clash of clans,5
It loads until connecting then all I get for last 2 days is error code 17. I can't play it to judge it,1
After playing with the game a few days I lost all interest because I hate in game purchases. Ruined the dungeon keeper franchise for me.,1
Love it,5
"This atrocity is nothing like Dungeon Keeper, stay away from this scam!",1
Don't give this crap money.,1
Very fun,4
"Dear EA,  No. Just stop.",1
,5
"It takes a while to get past the tutorials, but once you do its a really fun game!",5
Love these kind of games,5
Great,5
"Riddled with errors, miserable app.",1
"I was very disappointed in seeing a good franchise wasted on a cash grab. Unless you pay, the basic stuff takes an extraordinarily long time. This design is only intended for people with deep pockets. I know EA has gotten flak for their business models before, but this is an example of horrible choices. You could have made a fun game and choose not to do so.",1
,4
It's just a remake of clash of clans. Nothing from its former glory.,1
,5
This a game I would pay $10-$20 for. EA! Quit taking advantage of naive customers that don't remember how much content should be available without having to spend $1 or more whenever I want to advance in a 20 year old game. I installed it then saw it was micro transactions and deleted it instantly. Thanks for ruining the nostalgia I was hoping to have with this gem of a game turned in to a corporate greed scam! MAKE FULL GAMES WE CAN PAY ONE TIME TO PLAY!,1
It's a great game and time consuming,5
"This ""game"" is proof for any and all that EA is pure evil. When I saw that there was a new Dungeon Keeper I was initially ecstatic, then I saw that it was for mobile and my hopes dropped. Then I saw it was ""free-to-play"" and I lost all hope of it even being a game. I gave EA the benifit of the doubt and installed it anyway, what a mistake. This ""game"" is a thinly veiled money grab and is Dungeon Keeper in looks only. Save your time and find a real game. In app purchases are killing good game play.",1
,1
"The premise of games like this one is detrimental to the way people view games and to the gaming industry as a whole. It's a scammy, shameful way to screw people out of their money.",1
I remember playing this on the computer. The remake is great so far on my android. I just can't wait to get my mistresses back,5
So far so good.,5
I love the features of this game. No complaints so far.,5
"Buy the original for 5 bucks on pc, it's more fun and you'll save money since you don't have to pay to advance.",1
Haven't had any problems yet. Pretty addicting.,5
"I cannot play this on a plane, or a train or a plain in Spain. I cannot connect anywhere or anywhy without WiFi and I wonder why. Breaking hearts with constant drops, another flop from Electronic Arts.",1
makes time fly by....,5
It reminds me a lot of the original. Its great!!,5
Five out of five,5
Nice game play mechanics and fun basis.,5
,5
,5
,5
This game is outstanding and vastly mind catchingb,5
The originals are classic but this bs is horrible. Id prefer to pay 20$ and be able to do anything than having to pay 5$ for not waiting 24 hours for 1 tile.,1
Reminds me of the old dungeon keeper,5
Clash of clans with a little evil! Love it,5
Its fun and humorous.,5
,5
I can't believe they did this to one of my favorite games of all time!  It's nothing but a money grab with little or no value.  It doesn't in any way deserve the name Dungeon Keeper!,1
,5
"This is like taking Mario and turning him into chop suey, it's a disgrace to gaming. Way to ruin a classic series guys! At least you're making tons of money EA!",1
"This game was my childhood and you people corrupted it, I am sad.",1
Balls,5
Love it,5
,1
Rather pay for the app in order to play an offline mode than have to be nickle and dimed for such a classic game. What a shame.,1
"Another great gaming experience ruined by mandatory (if you want to progress at all) in-app purchases. Paying a buck or two here and there makes sense, but this game compels players into the $20+ greedy range.",2
Great game,5
Can't play,1
Fun stuff,5
"Fun game, but in app purchases limit potential early.",1
Full of micro transactions. Money grab.,1
I'll update my rating when I've played it more. As of right now it seems OK.,3
Alot like original...altho that was like 15 years ago lol,5
De-Evolution of gaming.,1
Nothing about this App strikes me as a game.  When I think of a game I think of engagement and rhythms of frustration and delight in getting through different challenges. This App is so deliberate in its attempts to get money out of your pockets it is ridiculous.,1
Played on my pc find this one lots more fun on the go. Mwehshahahha,5
This is an amazing game!,5
Didn't think it would be this fun,5
,5
I hate how your guys go to the worst spot possible will stand next to guys and let them destroy your stuff And very lagy no other game lags like this one,1
Great game very witty. Try it for sure. Does seem like a pay to win game though. ..,5
This is a pretty good game. Time to get back to it,5
Loving it,5
IAP purchases are destroying mobile gaming! Don't listen to these fat cats. Go buy the game on GOG for $5.99 and play for free forever!,1
A couple of times now I was logged on to someome else's dungeon. Have a hard time scrolling without having an imp dig instead. Someimtes can't even scroll at all. UI needs a lot of work. You have to slap your imps every half hour to cut your build/dig time in half. Defense are basically useless when you can blow up a wall or have mage flinging fireballs over it. Minions cost too much.,2
Love it,5
"Brings me back to my childhood in so many ways. I'm going to unearth my copies of this game now and hide in a cave while I wait for my poor, abused imps to dig a hole.",5
,5
"Fun game great graphics, but keeps code 7 me and force closing. Uninstalling less then 24 hrs after installing.",1
Slap your imp(s) hard for better production. Lol. Breathe of fresh air compared to castle clash type games.,5
Awesome!,5
Fun to play,5
over 10k 5 star reviews? These guys must have not have played the first one. Stay way from this festering pile and head over to G o G and get the good versions.,1
Funny and fun definitely recommended,5
Great way to kill time,5
"This completely ruined the name of the great games that came before it. It's not fun, and impossible to do anything without dumping money into it. Even then, there's nothing to really accomplish... It's not dungeon keeper in any way other than name.",1
Feels just like the original only better and mobile.,5
,5
Love the old game. This seems good so far!,5
Will keep you busy for hours.,5
Seems interesting now. Looks like eventually going to have to spend money to really do anything.,5
,5
Fun,5
,5
Tons of fun!,5
Koll,5
Thanks,5
At first when I tried the game I loved it and thus gave a positive review. Shortly there-after I hit a cash shop brick wall. The game went from a excellent remake of the classic for mobile platforms to you get to play for about 2 minutes and then wait for 4 hours for the next item to finish unless you pay. Again the design is amazing. It has awesome voice acting. The imp slapping is hilarious. The game feels rather bug free. But as the game stands currently it feels horrible broken in it's current state and you end up wasting a ton of money if you wanted any real play time out of it.,1
I can't stop playing it,5
...and funny!,5
,5
"The old version, back before internet, was awesome. I played it a ton, probably still have it somewhere, the sequel too. This has all that, and more humor to boot. Great job",5
Djs,5
Super cool,5
"I get the ""freemium"" concept, but gem mining really is too slow for decent game play. If it were possible to get gems quicker (other than buying them) it would be a 5 star game. Loved Dungeon Keeper on the computer. :-)",3
Yea,5
Little was sacrificed to make the game mobile and work in the free to play realm. Decided to leave this at 2 stars until the game is uncoupled from the required Google Sign In. I am not confident that such an app has adequate security in place to protect my login information.,2
,5
,1
Hours of fun,5
"EA took one of the best gaming franchises from Bullfrog and butchered it with pay to play mechanics. Sure the game is technically ""free"" but it takes over 24 hours to destroy ONE bloody block. If you want it done instantaneously then you have to pay real money for in game gems. Take into consideration you need to clear large sums of these blocks to even build anything substantial. Please don't give your money to these greedy devs. Save it and spend it on other games on the play store, REAL games",1
I've only played it for one day and its awesome,5
Vood,5
Ggghhhhhg,5
,5
,5
This game makes you wait for hours on end. Shameless money sucking garbage. Forget it. Uninstall,1
,5
Cool funny entertaining,5
"I like how its set up, reminds me of a hand held LoL",5
"Good concept but it's the same as every other mobile strategy game of its kind. Only difference it's based in a ""dungeon"" instead of a field. Also real money plays a big factor in how well you do.",1
Loving it atm :),5

Addictive,5

A freemium cash grab using an old IP.,1
Awe some,5
Fun!! Great idea game keeps u wanting to play!!,5
I've been playing a short time but seems very fun.,5
Game,5
"It's not s cookie cutter game like all of the others I've seen. Still time consuming if you are not spending money, but that's the name of all ""free"" games.",5
,5
I like it it's fun :),5
Awesome game so far,5
I just love any DK!,5
"Granted this game is in the free-to-play category, a pay or wait to win game play should have been expected. Having enjoyed the classic, I would have paid upwards of $8 to $10 for a mobile recreation. I will not be wasting any time with this version.",1
This game is awsome.,5
"So good, fricking wicked",5
Fun,5
Havn't encountered any glitches or annoying bugs yet.,5
Well made great game,5
They have taken an originally fantastic game and ruined it with microtransactions. Id rather pay $9.99 for the REAL game and not this BS.,1
This real cool,5
"The graphics are good and gameplay is decent. But micro transactions are crazy expensive. 800 gems for a 3rd imp costs $8.00. Anf 1 day to mine outside edges of dungeon, to speed that up costs about $2.50. Just absurd prices.",2
Great game highly recommended,5
Awesome freaking game people,5
Simply fun,5
Too evil sounding though,5
,5
,5
Great game,5
I played DK and DK2 years ago and loved it! So glad to see it resurrected!!,5
,5
,5
,5
I recommend this for all players,5
Best game ever,5
Its not the old DK but its still fun to play,5
,5
Good game,5
,5
"Very similar mechanics to clash of clans, but with the same imp slapping fun from the original DK games on PC. Love it.",5
So far its fun,5
Everytime i get on it says error  I deleted it. dont get this app,1
Id much rather pay outright for a game that I could play at a normal speed all of the time. I'm not paying for every building and block of ground dug out,1
The game is fun easy.addictive and works wonderfully. Deffinatly check it out,5
"Same as every other city building, army killing, guild joining game.  I do love dungeon keeper, wish it was a little more unique.",3
"A little glitchy, but a good time",5
Its everything that the PC version was with a more delayed build time. Still awesome.,5
Like it,4
Great,5
"Super additive, reminds me of old dungeon keeper",5
Just as good if not better then Clash of Clans!,5
,5
"I'm seeing a lot of 5 star reviews in here whose text suggest a much lower rating, don't know what that is all about. I'll echo the pinion that I'd gladly pay 10 dollars or more to play an actual version of dungeon keeper on my tablet. This is not even a game however. It's a program designed to get you in the habit of opening it daily and spending far too much money for very limited reward. Listen to your audience EA, check twitter, Facebook, gaming news sites, and this review section, and do right for once",1
,5
Love this game,5
"Taking a beloved franchise like Dungeon Keeper and squeezing it through the anus of the pay-to-win model only serves to make a pile of crap. Thanks for urinating all over a once-wonderful game in the name of profit, EA.",1
Love it,5
Will update later,5
I am getting tired of these time based games.  If they were to remove the stupidly long wait times I might reinstall.   On the bright side the game does look nice.,2
Reminds me of coc very fun,5
I'm like the feel of this game. Very fun.,5
This Isn't dungeon keeper at all. I would have spent money on a dungeon keeper port or reboot but this isn't even worth my time.,1
Very good HD port of a very cool PC game.,5
Great,5
Great way to kill time,5
"This is what you can expect.  You'll log on for a couple of minutes, click on some things then log off and wait for a couple of hours.  Of course you can always pay to speed things up but you'll end up spending a lot unless you like waiting for hours and hours on end.  Save yourself and just skip this game.",1
Great graphics and the demon is quite funny,5
,5
I played this game when it was a Computer Game ... and I LOVED IT!!! This is a very VERY good spin off of the original game. They even have my favorite character in this App that they had in the Computer Game. But I'll never tell who that is. Muh ho ha ha ha haaaa!!!,5
Clash of clans-ish,5
Hahaha,5
"I have very little time for games, but I really enjoy them, so this is perfect for me! If you don't want to wait I could see this game being VERY expensive to play!",5
Cannot connect to servers. Tell your imps to try harder. Deleting,1
Sweetness,5
"I played this on pc 15 years ago... Loved it then and a nice translation to small screen, as well",5
Love it,5
Played this FOREVER AGO on pc! One of the best games ever and happy to see it on android!!!,5
Easy to start,5
Pretty similar to the pc version. I love it!!!,5
very addictive,5
"This game is great, if you have ever played the PC version, you would appreciate this game, its a bit different, but for an app, I must say its a genius remake concept, keep up the great work guys!!!",5
,5
Actually rather oddly fun. Dan Bull turned me onto this game on his YouTube channel and I decided to give it a go. I found a fun build email up game with good humor. All around fun game,5
,5
,5
Pretty good game made,5
"Glitchy. Freezes constantly. The only nice thing is that the app restarts itself instead of freezing the phone and having to pull the battery to restart the phone.  Good idea on the game, but not able to play long enough to get full feel of it.  Boo on EA.  Should be able to program in their sleep at this point.",1
"Very fun game, addicting",4
GG,5
,3
Perfect time-killer,5
I like the game it has new feel to it for the strategic game,5
Good job EA...this game is truly an enjoyable experience. Fun with some comic relief. Love it!,5
"So been playing for a few days and even spent money on this game, but I encounter a bug that erased my data so the money I put in went away",1
,5
,5
"Not worth it. Everything is based on timers that you have to pay money to remove. This is an unplayable game.  A shame, it might be a nice little game if the paywalls were removed.",1
"It's nice that that brought dungeon keeper back, but there are just too many of these time based builders on the market these these days.",3
An awesome spin on the empire type of game.,4
,5
,5
Good,5
Pretty sweet,5
,5
Long wait but over all.fun,5
,5
,5
I love this game! It's a great way to kill time,5
"Easy to play, great graphics",4
No problems and lots of fun,5
Just remake the original dungeon keeper. EA killed a great game with gems and pay to win game play. What a joke. Ban ea from Google play for releasing this crap.,1
Better than clash of clans,5
,5
,3
I just love this game both DK 1 & 2,5
"Now we all know ea is horrid, but this is the absolutely worst. If you don't hand ea tons of money, you can sit and wait for up to 24 HOURS to dig out a plot of land. WTF?  How are people giving this 5 stars? Really. That's like buying an XBOX One or PS4 game then having to spend hundreds more to actually get to play the game. The more you all give these greedy pr!cks 5 stars and all your cash, the more they will do this. Buy the original game for your PC for a few bucks and actually get to play the game...",1
It is a great game and good graphics and amazing work on the game guys thanks for making the greatest game ever!,5
Great game but I doubt I'll be buying anything,5
"Resource management, tower defense, dungeon raids... and smacking imps. All good.",5
"Looks like the old DK games but plays like clash and so many other games that are just out to make money and you get can decimated quickly, losing all progress you have so far. Freezes and crashes constantly. Major Dissapointment.",1
Its sucks,1
"Unless you pay, you wait to play.",1
Could have been fun but greed.,1
Can't play unless you sign in via google+ displaying your personal data and location. What if you don't want to share that information? #uninstall,1
Another pay or wait forever to play game. Worthless.,1
"Wish it was more like the classic one for PC, but astoundingly great nonetheless.",5
Fun way to pass the time,5
Time consuming and entertaining,5
I remember this game. It was so much fun.,5
,5
Games fun. Nuff said. Too bad you have to spend so much money. So 5 stars for fun game. But probably actually 2 stars for the terrible free2play model being used here. If you have something else to keep you busy while times tick this can keep you busy during down times during other things.,5
Just wish there was not as much of a pay window,4
"I've become very familiar with the ""freemium"" model of mobile gaming over the past 6 months or so, but this is the worst I've seen. The pricing looks unremarkable (standard ripoff), but the extent to which gameplay is slowed and roadblocked in order to force you into paying is a new low. I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. Are these people dropping hundreds of dollars a month to get decent gameplay? Or just reviewing after 15 minutes? Either way no thanks.",1
,1
"Not the same as the original, but still pretty fun!",5
Just like old times,5
The freemium model in this 'game' is so obtrusive it makes me wonder if the developers ever had any intention to create something with any mechanics or gameplay model. Instead it is just a constant badgering for cash.,1
Far too much emphasis on pay to win...,1
Great game to pass my time,5
Addictive.....,5
So much fun while in bed before bed.,5
,5
Fun yah,5
"They've bastardized one of the greatest games ever made.  Congratulations,  EA. I blame you.  You couldn't do the right thing and release DK III; instead you drop a ""free"" mobile POS.  Could live with the new voices and changes in game play.   But to hijack my phone with notifications telling me when I could proceed in the game, because you can't actually play without spending 'gems'.  They're ""most popular"" package is  about $20.  ""Best"" deal?  $100!  Just to play an awful version of an amazing franchise.",1
"Why play a fun game when you can just throw a large sum of money at this app to have ""fun."" I would never waste a cent on this pile of garbage",1
One big money grab,1
The only way to play is signing in,1
Invincible,5
This is a fun dungeon builder,5
I loved this game just couldnt put it down!,5
Love it,5
"Just like the original, only better!",5
,5
,5
Whatever,5
"Easy to pickup, nice gameplay I had the pc version. Pretty close to that.",5
Fun but come on. 4h for stone? Thats some Bull! Eff you EA,5
,5
haha love all the characters and their personalities especially horny,5
Very creative,5
,5
"I have played this title on PC, but it whent under the name Dungeon Keeper 2. This mobile version still holds the comical evil feeling the older version had. Great game EA you never seem to let me down.",5
Burns my batteey away from playing so much lol,5
Reminds me alot of orcs must die...,5
"I'm convinced that app icon adequately portrays A: how any thinking consumer views EA, and B: how EA unashamedly, PROUDLY view themselves: the Devil Incarnate of gaming, mobile and otherwise.  Don't believe me?  Download this game, attempt to get as far as you can, then TELL me EA isn't racing to set a new standard in greed and outright contempt for their customers.  CONVINCE me that they aren't even trying to cleverly hide their abuse of the freemium model.  Shame on Google for FEATURING this garbage, and EA can go EAt... nevermind.   Negative 666 Stars.",1
,5
Grt it,5
,5
Its fun so far,5
Free an fun,5
Fun game,5
I tried this game as  supplement/replacement for clash of clans. It felt really tedious very quickly and it was very apparent almost immediately that you pretty much have to buy gems to get ahead (and their attempts to up sell you stuff is truly shameless). It's also feels very slow to start and I was bored almost as soon as I started playing. Pass for me.,2
Great game. Glad it is free. Could really do without the insistent guilt tripping over not upgrading my account.,5
Addicting,5
Excellent,5
It is a very excellent game.I can see how it relates to clash of clans.,5
"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE DOWNLOADING. I am sure the utter disappointment will continue to be fairly evident. I pay for games that are ""fairly-priced"" or ""worth-it"". There are a few out there. What EA did was take ideas from those games, make the build times longer, and the transactions more expensive. Try this until you decide you don't want to pay so much or wait so long, then uninstall just like I did.",1
Great game I've played in a while!,5
,5
"Nice, so far but I can feel the in app purchases being forced upon me already.",5
Can't stop playing!,5

"...and this devil doesn't want your soul, it wants your $$$.   All of it.  Every last dime.  Run very far and very fast from this one.  Run!",1
The fun of castle building with the $ EA has to make it awesome. A MUST PLAY!!!,5
"If you played it back when DK first came out, you'll be sorely disappointed. Nothing ruins a good game more than making it a freemium game...",1
"I loved playing the original dungeon keeper games on the computer as a kid,im glad to see the franchise making a comeback! Overall the game handles pretty well similar to clash of clans; which is pretty fun. 5 stars",5
Cool,5
,5
So far i really love this game.  I have not had any problems with it.  My only complbaint is the cost of the imps,5
Used to play the PC version loved it then...love it now!,5
Good so far,5
Just the waiting time is alil long and there should be a way to get free gems,4
,5
,5
It's a good game in the free (pay for boost) style ... Still would like a PC version,5
,5

This game is cancer.,1
Awsome sause A1,5
So far...,5
,5
,5
,5
Yes!,5
Good luc,5
"There is no way to play this game effectively without paying for it.  1 day to dig 1 square,  240+ gems to speed it up,  start with only 450, $50 for approximately 2500 gems,  getting the picture? Just go buy the games on pc for about $10 each.  Thanx for being the greedy,  money grubbing jerks your reputed to be EA.  Save yourself the time,  and skip this app!",1
"This reminds me so much of old school dk 1 & 2, try so much  Had to lower my rating because I keep getting a connection error now, please fix",3
So far so good,5
"Used to love this game when I was much younger, why make something good something bad?",1
Just like the PC version in many ways,5
Good time management game,5
Wow very addicting.,5
"I've never had to jump through so many hoops just to *install* a game on my phone. First I had to free up space - ok, that was overdue anyhow.  Then I had to update google play.  Then I downloaded it.  Then it downloaded updates (on a freshly downloaded game.)  Then It wanted me to sign in to an e-mail address.  Then it wanted to create a g+ profile for that address.  Then it wanted...and I gave up.  Sheesh.  This kind of nonsense is why I stopped buying EA games for my PC.  Now I know better than to ever download any of their garbage for Android.",1
,5
,5

One of few games you can get gems during game play and not downloading a ton. Patience is key. KCCO!,5
"An absolute joke of a ""game"" considering you have to pay if you want to do anything. EA is what's wrong with the gaming industry.",1
All it takes is patience.,5
Woooow,5
I hate messing with EA games never work for me on any system especially this one,1
Will rate again in the future,5
,5
Sweet,5
Rated 5 stars at 1st until I played it... Shame on you EA! 1 day to mine a block??? Seriously??? and to top it off you're gonna charge me for every little thing... Hopefully War for the Overworld doesn't try to rob us!,3
Super fun kills time,5
Very addicting,5
,5
Good,5
,5
,4
I like it. Got a guy that talks.,4
Reminds me of my childhood but this seems like the game type to try to get every penny out of you. I hope free isn't to restrictive. So far so good :),5
,5
Good,5
Will rate when I've played it more,5
Way better than most of the TD games that I've played lately.,5
"It's a great and interesting idea. Only thoughts are it's kind of a pain to rework the layout of your dungeon. There should be a mode to reorganize things like in clash of clans, and also some slightly shorter times when removing walls would be nice",4
Good game,5
Awesome,5
Nice gameplay and graphics,5
"A full day to dig out one block. If course you can pay to speed it up, but *$&_ that.",1
,5
Its fun and exciting,5
I love games like this. And for once your evil and get to smack minions around. If you like strategy Games you will like this.,5
Fun and enjoyable.,5
Good game play.  Laughed when you slap your minions. In house purchases are a bit high tho. But other wise this is a great casual play game.,5
,4
Even without in app purchases it's fun.,5
This horrible wannabe by EA suddenly went from 3 stars to 5 in 12 hours... i suspect auto self ratings to disguise this evil bussiness practice that has littered the gaming industry!!!,1
,5
I have to keep updating everytime I start it up.... I'm good.,3
Awesome!,5
,1
,5
Fun so far. Just getting started,5
Still a little money grubbing but that's just EA for ya.,5
Good way to blow some time,5
I enjoy it very much.,5
"Not a replacement for the original,  but an adequate substitute",5
"If you like Clash of Clans, you'll find this overwhelmingly similar.  Seems more like a Clash of Clans clone with a Dungeon Keeper theme.  Has similar issues to Clash of Clans with disconnects.",4
Great notalgia game for those that remember the original.,5
Not bad,5
Fun,5
It is a fun also me graffic game that is also very brutal I love it  B-),5
"I love it, just like I remember",5
,5
,5
,5
,5
Awesome game,5
Its got some pretty good graphics and the raiding is fun,5
It's been a long time since I've seen a major release milk players for money so quickly and relentlessly. You'll be asked to pay to avoid waiting /hours/ within the first 5 minutes of leaving the tutorial.,1
Fun,5
Poor attempt at the old classic. Pass on this one,1
,5
,5
This is a very great game. A real time killer.,5
Almost as much fun as the originals!,5
,5
"What a great freaking idea. Heres hoping for a real dungeon keeper revival on pc. But until then I,ll enjoy this little peice of nostalgia.",5
He s cool,5
It's EA they know what they are doing,5
Different and interesting,5
No complaint so far. Very funny,4
:-),5
A lot like the old PC game.,5
,5
"All it is, a different way of playing clash of Clans, except not even close to as good.",2
Just like the original with some updates,5
Game is chill and doesnt pressure you to buys gems,5
Awesome‚Ä¶,5
Don't play if you dont have days to wait for the dungeon to be built or money to spend. RIP dungeon keeper,1
Pretty fun so far,5
Great homage,5
This is edicting,5
Brings back great memories I loved this game for pc,5
"This game is unplayable for free. You have to wait for EVERYTHING! In app charges suck, just charge us $5 so we can have a playable game.  I played the original on PC, still have the CD.",1
This brings back so many evil memories.  I loved this on the pc and this as good but not as fast paced,5
Thumbs up,5
This game is ruined by a need to be on all the time (to collect resources manually) and to buy expensive gems.,1
Highly entertaining and great graphics. Highly recommend it.,5
Bugs here and there over all good,5
,5
Just like the old DK I remember!,5
"During play, a notification would pop up saying ""you are not connected to the server"" then, it would check for updates, load my 'unruly minions', then try connecting again... It also restarted my game, from the beginning, twice... please fix bugs! I fargin' loved this game on PC when I was a teenager!  I just asked and searched two weeks ago for this game and for it to be there and be unable to play it is tortuous! The thought counts for something, but now.... I need my game!",2
Time killer.,5
Great game to pass the time. Original game with old school concepts,5
Awesome and buildy,5
Usually don't like these games but this is pretty fun,5
So addicting I can't stop,5
So far its a great game keep up the good work,5
I don't feel pushed into buying stuff. Great graphics!,5
Down load game it's fun,4
Good to pass time,5
Loved it back in the day.hoping to see it's surVived the virtual goods age,5
Awesome,5
I like this game,5
Good time,5
Thanks again,5
,5
Great game if you all way's wanted to challenge someone with your mind and creativity,5
"The devil guy is great,  good twist on tower defense.",5
Just like all the rest with a dark twist new I like it,5
Glad to see a semi-revival of a classic gem!,5
4 hours for a single block... 24 hours for the hardest blocks. This is awful.,1
Ink,5
There are countless of games like Clash of Clans but this one is very different and rewarding. Amazing game!!!,5
Awesom,5
Great job ruining a classic game,1
Very entertaining,5
Great memories too,5
This game is fun and addicting,5
,5
No problems with it on the s3,4

"Great  gadme, overall different from others. Amazing",5
10/10 would play,5

One of the most fun games I've played,5

"Good graphics,good sound,and amazing story.",5

Fun game so far only played about 20 minutes seems entertaining im assuming itll be more difficult to get gems later on and youll have to buy them,5
I like it so far,5
Not quite as good as the original on the PC but its good enough for me! :D,5
I love how quick and easy it is to build stuff and play the game in general. Great job guys!,5
Thanks,5
"This reminds me of the many, many hours I spent playing the old game! Not exactly like it, but it's also on a phone.",5
"Every once and a while I get some lag, but that can be fixed.",5
,5
And this is a great follow up!,5
Horny is friggin funny as hell,5
Yay!,5
"First SimCity, now this. Deplorable, EA.... deplorable.",1
,3
To be honest I was a little apprehensive at first about the game when I saw it the play store. Glad that I went ahead and downloaded as it is a great modernized version of a game I didn't realize I missed as much as I do! Good work guys!,5
"As far as Facebook-esque games go, this one is pretty top notch.",5
Fun game. Nice visuals and dont have to spend a bunch of real money to play.,5
,5
Awesome game,5
,5
Highly addictive right from the start!,5
Nice feel to it I must say.,5
,5
This seems like a pretty well made remake. Except for the fact that it can take HOURS to excavate a single tile.. Unless you pay a LOT. Seriously? EA is just a money grubbing crappy company and this is just a rip off of Clash of Clans.,1
Fun,5
Addictive,5
It is like the best,5
Dungeon Keeper was an awesome game.  This is only a ripoff of every other PvP builder game out there with some superficial similarities to the original game.  And its buggy on top of that.  Lots of screen flicker and just last night I opened the app to find that I was somehow in control of some other persons dungeon.,1
Very entertaining was a big fan of the org PC game love this,5
Great,5
Nice,5
,5
Fun game,5
Nice bonus of pay gems at start so no need to pay. Still fun without paying,5
Fun game,5
,5
Great game so far a lot of fun,5
"I used to play DK on the PC, this is a great throw back. Very well done!",5
I don't remember how long its been but I loved this game,5

"I loved DK when it was on the pc, now that its on my tablet, I can relish in my old days with this amazing game...I'm looking for my desktop version as I write this",5
Mach a go go Mach a go go Mach a go go go!,5
Needs to get green faster but dope,5
New,5
"The game forces you buy gems in order to keep playing. The ""best value"" on the cash shop is $110, and is only enough to dig ~50 squares",1
It looks like a good game but it keeps freezing and kicking me out the app I have alcatel one touch and I don't have this problem with other apps I hope you guys fix this soon I really want to play but I can't even finish the tutorial without getting lag or kicked out I really hope this gets fixed then I'll change my rate two 5,2

"Free to download, but expensive to play past 20 minutes. Also the license agreement was ridiculous , just read it. Would have loved to just pay one time and purchased the game outright.",1
,5
"I didn't like, I've been playing dk since it first came out. This is not a dk.",1
Takes why took long to mine blocks is nothing like dungeon keeper,1
,5
I like it,5
They butchered everything the orginal dungeon keeper wad and made it into a farmville money begging timer based pay to win game. I would of gladly paid 70 dollars for a new dungeon keeper.. not this garbage. It saddens me greatly that EA murdered this remake of dungeon keeper....,1
Just awesome,5
I recommend it,5
A lot like clash of clans but kinda more funny,4
Playing this game is near impossible without paying large sums of money,1
Love this. Reminds me of the old pc game,5
,5
,4
Froze up way to much,1
Fun,5
It's awesome,5
Ok,5
"Dungeon keeper was one of my favorite games. Tbis is hilarious and fun, just like I remember the old PC version being.",5
"Now I know why it was free.  The first time my minion encountered a stone wall I was hit with a 3-hour plus wait time. And I had only just started playing. But it doesn't stop there. You must upgrade your rooms, traps, knowledge for spells, etc. The list goes on and on seemingly without end.   This game also makes you buy your minions with gobs ""gems"" that you dig up. You will run out of dirt before you can truely stock up on enough minions to efficiently run your dungeon empire. But that is OK because you can use real $$ to buy more gems. Which you will have to do anyways due to other aspects of the game that also require those awesome gems. And don't get me started on the gold coins...  I would MUCH rather simply buy a game and actually be able to play, than have to deal with this stupid nonsense.",1
Shibby!,5
Great game so far,5
Reminds me of when I used to play on the PC.,5
,5
In app purchases are the clear focus of this game. Greed once again wins out.  Shame on you EA. Probably would be a good game otherwise.,1
Awesome game!,5
Addictive fun,5
"Pay wall ridiculously early. Looks like DK, but that's not the experience. This title deserved so much better.",1
"As the title says, it's free to pay, not free to play. Would rather pay a one time fee than pay for microtransactions. And don't say this is like arcade games. At least back then if you were skilled enough you could get through a game with a single quarter.",1
Sweet game reminds me of evil genius,5
Really fun. Original mechanics.,5
"Sad that this is what people consider gaming these days. If tapping a screen 4 times a day is your idea of fun, you'll love all that this ""game"" has to offer. R.I.P. Dungeon Keeper. You were a classic once.",1
^_^,5
"I like the game and the way the the tutorial is given, very interactive and fun",5
,5
Cool that there bringin it back bit it wont start keep hetton code 7  origanal is veryfun though,1
,5
Great game,5
Its like the ultimate defence game and i like slapping people,5
EA screws over another great title by making it unplayable with in app purchases.,1
"Loved it years ago on the PC, and they've done a good job porting it over to the tablet.",5
Lots of replay value,5
Great,5
Game play is severely hampered if you don't pay a continuous stream of money.  Combine that with an always pvp environment and in-app purchases that give a significant advantage you get a game that does nothing but suck your money away and gives you little in return.  This game had so much to offer but instead preys upon those who suffer from gambling addictions.,1
Excelent,5
This game is different than most of the games I've played,5
This isn't a game. It just extorted money from you. The positive reviews must be paid spam because i can't see how anyone would give this a good review.,1
Its a fun redo of a classic,5
,5
"It takes literally 1 entire day to remove 1 block of dirt without paying any of my hard earned money.  For a game whose ONLY way to progress is to remove dirt. This is robbery.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I played, and enjoyed the original game.  Paying hundreds of dollars to play the game in a reasonable amount of time is insulting.  The actual dungeon keeper game is $10.  Buy it and play as long as you want for only the price of the game.  Horrible micro transactions RUIN this game.",2
Fun,5
Great game for pooping,5
Good way to pass the time,5
,5
,5
,5
"MICROTRANSACTIONS. seriously, to make any progress, be prepared to spend ALOT of cash for this so-called ""free"" game",1
Like Clash of clans but not to alike.,5
Game looks cool...but it would restart areas already completed repeatedly and would cause the touchscreen on my Note3 to stop responding.,1
,5

"Didn't think I was going to like this game, but, it really is a well polished game. Thanks for the hard work.",5

This game is very unique and fun its humor is just a riot!,5
"EA have taken another great franchise of yesteryear and completely corrupted it for the sake of a parasitic business model. I don't have a problem with f2p per se, but as with plants vs zombies, EA have made this game essentially unplayable without forking out for repeated microtransactions.",1
Gaming is the best,5
Boy this is a blast and VERY addictive! ! Kudos EA!!!!,5
Fun game,5
Brings back memories of the original,5
"It gives you full control of your very own dungeon. Plenty of reasons to stay interested with campaign, and not to mention multiplayer.",5
"A brief glance at the past ,what a great game this was  for its time on the Early PC''  and this could have been just as good if it was a normal playable. Game    Its so sad they let corporate GREED turn this into a disgusting cash sink ' pay for gems or wait and suffer   you are forced to pay to get anywhere  I am   so sick of these Nickel and dime suck your wallet dry games  in app crap , guess EA is trying to be like Gameloft ,  I'd gladly pay 5$ or10$ even 20$ For this game if it was just a normal game that played without the GEM EXTORTION --   DELETE",1
Cool,5
Fun little game simple and easy,5
"Instead of a game, you get the desecrated cadaver of a once-great franchise, propped up next to a sign begging for money.",1

Loved dungeon keeper for pc.  Was super excited that I found this!,5
,5
The game is good but better have gd internet connection ‚ùá,5
Enough with the timed games. 4hours to dig a block of gold? I was really hoping this would have the dungeon keeper feel and not the farmville feel,5
Interesting game. To play.,5
You're going to beat this game easy,5
,5
Code 17 is all it tells me and won't let me play.,1
This completely blows all other games remotely close to it out of the water! I would recommend this to anyone! Best game on Google play!!!!,5
I love this game!,5
"Game doesn't load past ""checking for updates"" screen.",1
Error code 17. Will change reviews when fixed,2
"The latest evolution of free to play left us with a violated classic. If you played the original, great game, don't download this mobile version. EA has desecrated our memories.",1
"So I read some of the reviews of this game and I really had to wonder how bad could it be.  Most of the professional reviews of the game focus on one thing, the micro purchasing of the gems.  That's all well and good and I agree with the fact the micro-purchasing will eventually do this game in.  But, there are more problems.  EA wants all of your account information on Google.  They also want you to remain connected to the internet to even play the game.  So really, three things needed for this game to be worth it.  1. Get rid of the micro-purchasing 2. Allow the gamer to be anonymous 3. Drop the internet requirements  The original DK and DK2 games were great, I still play them from time to time.  This, shouldn't even be gratified of the name ""game"", it's a data harvester for EA nothing more.",1
,5
Great game,5
Great game with funny and colourful characters. Just a fun easy to understand and addictive way to spend a little time. Thank you.,5
"Great game, mix between pc verison and clash of clans",5
Pretty good game for passing time,5
I LOVE GAMES LIKE THIS ONE AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY 24/7,5
This Is One Of The Best EA Game I Have Played For Mobile Phone Keep Them Coming Bros!!!,5
I love this it's a rebirth of an old classic,5
,5
Wicked,5
Fun game thank you.,5
,5

Fun,5
It good. I only rated because I had a great time playing didn't really think of anything.,5

I like the gameplay alor better.,5
Really great game please DON'T RUIN IT.,5
Grate side version of the original games,5
Title,2

Very good graphics and tutorial is fun.,5
Great fun game and the graphics are sweet,5
"Not only is it a disapointment when I was hoping for a mobile original dungeon keeper, but it also is filled up to the tip of collapse with microtransactions, and even thought I like the ""2x build speed"", it does not make up for the grummy, money wanting theifs that is EA. I would rather pay $10 on Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 than pay $10 for 1200 gems.Thanks for ruining Dungeon Keeper. If you think this is a good idea to download this ""game"", then go download Clash Of Clans. It's better than this atrocity",1
Easy to pick up an play,5
This isn't dungeon keeper. This is a dumb micro transactions money pit.,1
"24 hours to clear a single block of land? 24 hours? When EA finally goes financially bankrupt, it will have happened long after the collective went intellectually and ethically bankrupt. If you're giving this 5 stars, you're a fool.",1
Really fun and addictive,5
I will play and it tells me therd was an error. So I reload and it lags out of the game.,3
"I honestly expected a half baked cash grab remake of the origional, but so far it is fairly generous with gems nd the boost are nothing that you can't live without or skill can't fix.",5
Fun,4
,5
Just a really fun and simple game to play,5
Good,5
This game is rich in detail and story. The rendering on the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is exquisite and makes this game an engaging mobile gaming experience.,5
,5
Very fun game,5
Now I am enjoying this game immensely. I will give a more in depth review once I get the premium. I loved this game way back when and I love that I can experience that feeling of evil happiness all over again. On my phone!,5
Everything is on timers the farther you get the longer the timers. Or you can pay to hurry the timers. Waist of time. Dungeon Keeper in name only.,1
I cannot put my phone down while playing! Addicting!,5
Doing anything but the intro takes hours of afk time. Don't waste your time on this farmville junk,1
"Runs great, no issues. Play is great.",5
"Been playing this game for an hour now and im hooked...playing flawlessly on my htc 4g lte....great graphics and a lot of fun figuring out how everything works...and its a FREE app so thats a bonus,of course you can buy coins,rocks,spells and stuff but a lot more fun unlocking it through the game.",5
Reminds me of long hours playing DK on the computer.,5
Great game reminds me of being a kid on the computer,5
Great game,5
,5
Good old fun.,5
Fun,5

Yay,5

I had my doubt's but this a surprisingly quick a d fun game.,5
So much fun. I love it,5
Game,5

Fun,5
"I loved this classic game from back in the day. It was so much fun to play. I was extremely excited to see this game come to Android. After, ""playing"" the game for a few days, I'm disappointed. Not because of graphics or glitches, but because it is a money pit. If you want to progress fast, be prepared to pay up. If you don't mind slower than molasses in a polar vortex game play, then by all means download. You won't be disappointed. 2 stars for this type of gaming model.",2
,5
"If you love Clash of Clans you will love Dungeon Keeper. It is SO very similar, yet different enough to be equally entertaining without getting old. The only issue with this game is that when you deploy troops for defense they will generally do nothing but stand around while your base is destroyed. Extremely frustrating.",4
Great time killer similar to clash,5
,5
,5
Good,5
Good,5
The game is sweet. Def addictive,5
"Everything about it runs so smoothly, and I couldn't ask for more",5
,5
But I think it should be like when you take over a dungen it yours or you can buy another dungen,5
"At first, everything is new and intriguing, but slowly descends in to a maintenance job. Every time you return to the dungeon, it's been raided, and you need to rebuild your minions. Going nowhere fast.",2
Lots of fun,5
,5
Ceep getting error code 919 what is going on,1
The gameplay is fun and reminds me of the original to an extent. The microtransactions are way overboard though. Save all gems you get to buy imps because imps are just way overpriced and are too integral to the game itself. And as with many free to play games - pay to win is the order of the day. You will have trouble getting into the top 10 unless you are willing to shell out tons of cash.  As a casual game this isn't too bad. Just don't go in expecting Dungeon Keeper.,3
,5
"Love it.......well, did love it b4 it started freezing constantly",5
Haven't had this much fun in a long time,5
"Kinda good. It's Clash of Clans, except more evil. Cool stuff.",5
:-) good graphics and its a good game good job one of your best games,5
,5
Takes the classic game and makes it mobile.,5
Like the orignal,5
Fun,5
Awesome game,5
,5
It was and still fun,5
,1
I've been waiting for this for awhile now. Can't wait to start! UPDATE: Best game EVER!!,5
To destroy such a great clasic game with this crappy pay to win scheme goes beyond vile.,1
It's fun and very addictive love it .,5
,5
You'll probably want to drop 20 bucks to get more imps but the is game is probably the funnest in the genre.,5
Monetization through delaying gameplay makes this game absolute trash. Not even worth your time.,1
I am adjusting to the interface. But the fun is the same.,5
"Game starts off fun, but after  you use the gems and start doing missions you'll quickly realize the pay wall is quite staggering.",2
,5
"If you like waiting or paying lots of money ($100 == best value?) So you can wait for the next thing instead, this is the game for you.  Not remotely worthy enough to bear the dungeon keeper name.",1
"I loved this game, I loved it when it was on the computer and I totally love it now keep it up electronic arts, you guys ROCK!!!",5
Like the game play,5
I love this came it fun and strategic,5
,5
Lol,5
,4
Check out this app. Its amazing,5
,5
This game is fun and addicting,5
,5
"This game has, bar none, the worst microtransactions I have ever seen.  It is a horribly dumbed down version of DK which keeps reminding you that you could do everything the same speed you can in the original (cheap to buy on GOG these days) if you keep paying. It would only take about a day to spend more in this game than it would cost to buy a new PC and the original, far better game.  Avoid at all costs.",1
Awsome,5
"Fun, entertaining, and clever, but 4 hours to mine out a single block? And behind that a room that will take time to claim? The gap between waiting periods is just too great.",4
,5
Cool game a lot of surprises to keep me going,5
Poor execution...lacking things to do with the blatant money grab...so sad!,2
Slow at first but gets fun if ya stay with it.,5
,5
"Game is so slow...I'm not building a dungeon, im watching it collect dust. :(",1
Great game,5
A beautiful rendition of a classic. I've loved the DK franchise for years!,5
Great fun. A lot like the original. Should make for many hours of wasted time. ;),5
A+,5
Ive spent hours and plan to spend way more,5
This game is ruined by micro transactions.  EA is too greedy.,1
Love it,5
Pay2win,1
Way to go EA... thanks for disgracefully ruining the Dungeon Keeper series with this money grabbing joke of a mobile game. No wonder you've earned the title of worst company two years in a row. This mobile 'game' and a broken Battlefield 4 will surely earn you that title for a third year.,1
,5
You can't even call it that without paying hundreds of dollars...,1
,5
Yup,5
Fun,5
Nice game guys outstanding,5
I love the pet dungeon idea,5
"Looks great, very fun. However, it is ridiculously expensive to do anything. Its simply a play to win game. Disappointed.  I loved the pc versions",2
Im actually liking this game. Awesome job!,5
Dk is awesome,5
Lots of game play,5
Nice game,5
,4
It's just the kind of game I love.  Strategy village building,5
Would not accept as any names for the dungeon.  Uninstalled,1
Thats all this is,1
Overall a great and fun game,5
Perfect!,5
,5
Lots of disconnections and reconnecting to server. Good game and graphics I must say,3
Great game!,5
,5
Good,5
"Great concept, I love it!",5
"Very fun, funny, and addicting. Reminds me of clash of clans which I still play.",5
Great game,5
,5
Its pretty self explanatory yeah u have to wait if u don't want to spend real money but its a well built game cool graphics great sounds just wish I had more gems for free,5
Awesome game,5
All the magic that made dungeon keeper awesome on the pc is eaten away by in app purchases and excessive time delay.,1
"EA should be ashamed of this game. It is an obvious ploy to extort gamers into spending money on gems. Free to play is ruining mobile gaming, and EA is one of the worst offenders.",1
,5
,4
"The was a great game on the PC. This has the same general format, but it's really just a tool to get you to buy ""gems"".   They have taken out the fun and upped the cost.",1
,5
Awesome game. Well done. I've been looking for a game like this so I started playing clash of clans but it's not as fun as this one,5
The mechanics work well enough.  I'm just starting out so we'll see what happens over time.,5
,5
Great,5
,5
,5
Awesome,5
I really enjoy this game,5
"Great graphics, nice concept, but I'd rather pay for the game up front then have to buy items in order for it to work properly. I'm not going to wait 4 hours for my imp to mine through a stone wall, or pay for gems just for him to do it as well as he should.",2
Reminds me of the old dungeon keeper humor and feel. This one has similar mechanics as castle clash,5
I like this game. It's fun. The problems I have with it are that it disconnects too often and you are constantly begged for money.  You are better off using the money to go buy the original game for PC.,2
Just a little slow in the beginning,4
"Absolute garbage because EA thought it would be great to make you pay for every move (or you can just take one turn per day). Yay.  Remember to rate all one-star reviews as ""helpful"" or they get buried.",1
"Keep up the good work, and please keep the game well balanced. I DON'T want to have to spend $100 to try and keep up in this game.",5
I remember playing this on pc years ago.  It's nice to see it remade for android devices.,5
Tis fun,5
Keep up the fun,5
"Unplayable without pumping huge amounts of money into the game with IAPs. Obviously designed from the ground up to be a grinding, money-grabbing, exploitive game.",1
Fun game and different,5
I loved the original dungeon keeper. With this game there is enough in it to remind me of the original that I like it,5
Its really awesome,5
Won't run on my low end android. That's mostly my fault not EA. Get what you pay for I guess,3
,5
Highly recommended,5
Just another game where I wait hours for a single action to complete. Waste of time.,1
Great game. Needs cheaper imps,5
Get it,5
True to the original. Witty banter and fun game play.,5
,5
"Damon, second clash of clans right here",5
It rocks!!!,5
"Awesome mix of great game play, comedy and graphics. Get this right away!",5
So lame do yourselves a favor and find the old dk game.  It's far superior to this blatant cash grab.,1
I never rate games but this game is awesome!,5
Great game,5
The game crashes every time I go in to it and I cant play it and its kind of a rip off uninstall.,1
Gameplay limited by spending real money or waiting for everything... Which takes forever. Terrible.,1
,5
This reminds me of the times that I played on my computer and even an old game like DK it was still fun. Now like this its still fun to play.,5
,5
"I love the original dungeon keeper and its sequel.  This game has some really good streamlined mechanics that grow from the original. Unfortunately, it's crippled by the blatant cash grab mechanics.  Want to mine that square? That'll take 4 hours... Unless you pay!  Want more than 2 imps (especially important because your imps are all busy with those lame 4 hour jobs...)?  Pay up.  I was so excited when I saw this, now I am just disappointed.",2
This is a completely awful port of a once great game. Whoever had the idea of changing the dynamic of the game and adding microtransactions is a complete idiot. I was very excited about this game because I used to play it all the time. Upon downloading it and realizing that EA has destroyed yet another once great franchise with its ridiculous business practices a small part of me and my childhood died. Sincerely disappointed!,1
I loveeeee it,5
Good fun,5
Good,5
They removed everything from dungeon keeper except how it kind of looks. Another Was game pushing you every step of the way to toss absurd amounts of money to speed up how intentionally slow and limited  they made the game..What happened to the days of making complete games?,1
You either pay or wait days for stuff to complete.,2
I can review a game I haven't even seen.  And I can't see other reviews.  WTG Google,1
,5
Meh,5
,5
Love this game,5
Sofar so good,5
"Well thought out and creative, its slow to build unless you drop cash but its very fun",5
,5
,5
Awesome game,5
"I remember the first dungeon keeper. You could dig out rooms in minutes not hours, single levels only took a few hours at most to beat. This game, however, is just another pay to win load of bullocks, needing to pay gems to make the game move ahead at a decent pace is a crime. Better to get the original from GOG, and play it the way Bullfrog wanted you to.",1
Ea should be ashamed of themselves.,1
really glichy,4
Awesomeness pure awesomeness,5
,5
,5
,5
"All the snide comments, zany opponents and awesome that I remember from the original.  That's about the only good stuff.  All the micro-transactions and in-app purchases make this unplayable after the demo.  Thanks, EA, for wrecking another great franchise.",2
,5
Another Great Game from EA Games!!!,5
Love this game check it out,5
It's good so far just hard to get use to these types of games. Once I get into it will be 5 stars,4
Sss,5
Fun,5
,5
Very very great game. The fun part is when you slap your Imps and they work twice as fast!,5
"This is a horribly ruined version of what was once a great game franchise... So sad, I'll be uninstalling after this. FOR SHAME EA!",1
And fun,5
"All the mircro transactions killed it for me. Would have gladly paid the one time fee offer, just not...this :/",1
super awesome graphics,5
"You could conceivably spend the money currency to mine every single block. That's a disgusting amount of greed on the part of the developer. And it turns out it's not that fun, either. Too bad.   Seek out the original computer games for a better experience.",1
"Way to go EA, you managed to trash another classic name in gaming.",1
Great free little game. I recommend it,5
Its a lot of fun and its quite cute :),5
Fun game.,5
This game is really fun and addicting!,5
,5
Pretty addictive and a different spin on traditional strategy games.,5
Well crafted and updated version of the old Dungeon Keeper. Outstanding graphics and gameplay.,5
Good,5
Okay so far. Wish you could tap multiple dig spots and they would just be waiting in a queue like the original. That way you can keep an Imp busy without having to check on completion of a gem vein or hard rock block constantly. Would greatly speed up dungeon design.,4
,5
Yeah you should be ashamed of yourself and you should rethink this game and release it as if it was the old Dungeon Keeper,1
Love dungeon based games,5
^,5
"Cheap ""pay-to-win"" game. Could be fun, payment model ruins it all.",1
"I was so excited when I saw Dungeon Keeper up as a FREE game! I should have known it was too good to be true. Slow to download, numerous ""updates"" right after I downloaded (so it took over 5 minutes to open the game), glitchy play causing the music to be slow and sound like a funeral dirge, and no offline play leading to a short, battery-eating experience I was happy to finally be dropped from before I even saw an opponent. I didn't even get a chance to be hit up for money like many other reviewers before I couldn't take it anymore. Someone with a MUCH better tablet/phone and a MUCH deeper wallet might have a better experience. I'll stick with solitaire.",1
This app is the best 5 stares,5
Fun,5
I miss the old DK2 and still want DK3 but this moible edition is acceptable if not for the price gouging. The average greedy EA moible game.,1
"Game takes the Title and familiar Characters and monstrously transfigures them into a cell shaded, money milking or wait 24hrs waiting corpses! Pass if you have a shred of self respect, respect for classics of gaming, or desire to not want to waste your money on a lackluster title.",1
Great game,5
"This game used to be insanely fun on the pc without all this wait time and needing to buy gems just so you dont have to wait an entire day for one patch of gold or gems to be dug out. And having to pay 800 gems for another imp? Ridiculous. Deleting this game and if I could give you zero stars i would. You turned an amazing game into trash. I feel sorry for all the people actually buying these gems and boosters from you. Everyone should just buy the actual pc game, you would enjoy it a whole lot more.",1
Amazingly fun game!,5
Great way to pass the time.,5
I have played for about 30 min. And the game is a gas.,5
Good fun.,5
Fun,5
Pay to win.  Could have been so great. ..,1
Don't like the fact that my minions stand there and watch while dungeon gets destroyed it happens way to much good idea poor game play. smarter AI is needed until that happens this game is crap.,1
,1
"After playing for a few days, I can honestly say that the game is too reliant on crystals (pay currency). I can understand speeding things up, but to buy imps and even just to ACCESS event raiding ?!? Fix that and ill happily give 4 stars, give me my minions back if they haven't been killed instead of ""use and loose"" and that will earn one more star :3",2
,5
,4
I recommend,5
Great,5
the best,5
,5
Microtransaction city. This might be a bigger disgrace than NBA Live.,1
,5
,5
You might have to spend your lifetime to play this game. Good game just wasted by greed. Hope you don't waste your time.,1
Funny play little slow but worth it,5
Yep,5
Fun commentary and amusing animations. One of the better apps out there now.,5
Awesome,5
"The entire game is based on  buying gems. Imps mine resources. You're given 2 Imps to start. There's 3 different blocks they can mine which take 3 seconds, 4 hours, and 24 hours respectively. You'll have to mine the bigger ones to make any progress at all, and to speed up the process costs 250 gems for the biggest block. That's about $2.50 FOR ONE BLOCK. OUT OF HUNDREDS. You may protest ""I'll just earn gems myself rather than  buy them"". That will be a very arduous process netting you 5-10 gems a week. Lol",1
Good game,5
"Like a ""Dark"" Clash of Clans!!",5
"Fun, easy, like it.",5
Goooooood,5
,5
Really simple but fun to play and easy to upgrade,5
,5
One of the best build and protect village games ever,5
Played it back in the day. Glad to see it here,5
Great,5
,5
"This is the worst kind of ""game"". EA has ruined a classic. Just go to Good Old Games and buy the original.",1
It's a great game to play in your downtime. It keeps you busy constantly scrounging resources to build your army and overtake other dungeons.,5
"I enjoy this game and spent 40$ on it fast but if i had known that it would dowload a 35mb update every frikkin time i started it then i wouldnt have spent a di.e. it has chewed through my 4gb per month online access in days. You need to do something bout that, developers! I give it a week then im uninstalling due to no internet access.",1
Good,5
It's a different approach to a lot of games that already exist.  I'm not 100% positive it's a great game but they asked me to give it a 5-star so they can make free updates.  I doubt they will but until I'm given a reason to give it a lower review...5 stars it is.,5
These in app purchase games are getting out of hand. Game progression is so slow you really need to pay to play in order to get anywhere.,1
This game is very poorly designed. They purposely slow down parts of the game in order to make you feel like you have to pay to speed things up. Would rather pay for the original games than put up with this.,1
"In game purchases must not be part of gameplay.  I am big fan of original games by Bullfrog, and this is not what Peter Molyneux would do.",1
Wooot,5
,5
The game don't sync properly.  When it does I have my normal dungeon. When it don't I get this lvl 1 dungeon at the very edge of the tutorial.,4
Awesome! Sort of alike to clash of clans but great!!!,5
"I love how you can get lost for hours slaping imps and conquering other dungeons. The Monkeyfreek dungeon is the bomb(or spiked floor, in my case)",5
It shuts down on me and on my phone it won't connect,5
Wonderful,5
Cooooool,5
Pay to win. It's ea what do you expect,1
This is a really fun farm and build game. Based off of the classic version on pc its the same with more to it. Great game. Its free so,5
Awesome,5
Cool,5
The game is incredibly dull unless you are willing to pay out big $$ in microtransactions.  Buy the original for your PC if you want to play dungeon keeper.  It is much cheaper and a far better game.,1
,5
,5
This app is even more fun than the original,5
"Whoever let EA get their hands on this old classic should be shot. In both gameplay and feel this is not Dungeon Keeper, this is a heavily simplified money-wringer. Would not recommend.",2
Similar to the PC game and loads of fun!,5
Very cool game,5
,5
"The game may bear the same name, but its mechanics and gameplay share little resemblance to the brilliance of the original '90s game. If I can't find my CD of the original PC version, I'm getting the digital download from GOG for $6.",1
Game play is very enjoyable. Great job mythic,5
keep it up!,5
,5
"EA takes a classic, genre-defining game and ruins it with their typical business model.  Appalling.",1
Retains little of the charm of the original and super mega micro transaction heavy.,1
Good free mobile games,5
Play it your will never be sorry,5
"Long wait times, 4 hours just to dig out a gem mine. Making  imps so expensive means waiting forever to get stuff done",3
Addictive,5
This game is easy to play the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun. I would recommend this game to anyone.,5
This game is not what the older ones are like. It's pay to win trash.,1
Amazingly fun game.,5
"Outstanding graphics,  easy to play.  Loads of fun",5
Installed this app over the weekend and it runs constantly in the background.  Killed a full battery charge in 45 minutes. I have the Galaxy Note2 and usually get about 2 days of battery life out of my full charge.  EA needs to work on this resource management for this game.,1
,5

Excellent,5
IAP sucks!,1
Gud game,5
This is a cool game,4
"This game is a complete abomination. What a disgrace. EA, please die in a fire!",1
So far it's pretty fun. Seems like a good way to kill some time.,5
This game would be great if they didn't try to nickel and dime you every step of the way! I understand they are trying to make money but this is ridiculous. Cut the wait times on digs by at least half and balance out the gem system.,1
It's a fun game different but fun game. The mechanics are the same just underground now.,5
Its An Awesome Game,5
,5
Started playing yesterday and I can't put it down,5
,5
New,5
,5
,5
,5
So so so so so good,5
Kinda like clash of clans but my opinion its a little better!!!,5
For free,5
"As a player of the original keeper. It brings back the days of old. The bleeding of heroes, the disciplining of imps and the mounds of gold. The game time to build things and gathering of supplies seem a little slow, but maybe that will change in an update. This Keeper is eager to rule once more.",5
Fun strategy and a good twist from the generic city builders!,5
"Clash of Clans style with a tower defense twist, much more organized with defending playing a much more critical role.",5
Thought it was like the computer game I played but I was wrong this is just as fun though.,5
Awesome,5
"Yep good game, lets see if i get hooked",5
If y9u liked the pc game you will like this game on the phone,5
They to one of the best sandbox PC games and turned it into another %$#%54 farmville style piece of %$&#,1
Started playing about a day or so ago and really enjoying it so far,5
,5
A wonderful game that brings out the evil in you.,5
Definately get it very unique,5
I'd recommend it to a friend. Fun to play and adds a really nice twist to the genre.,5
,5
Better than clash of clans.,5
"Fun, addicting, and definitely easy to play. Well worth downloading.",5
Very fun and funny,5
So much fun.,5
Derp,5
,5
,5
"Played it for a few hours, tutorial was pretty good at explaining the game but overall it just feels far too grindy which made me not even want to invest anymore time into it. It seems like all the troops you deploy on raids are lost not just ones that die, that's really annoying. Aside from that you don't have much access to ""fun"" things and the requirements for upgrades and unlocks increase exponentially. If you don't mind the grind maybe you'll like this game though.",2
Excellent,5
Fun game,5
Fun n funny,5
In the spirit of Dungeon keeper with a multiplayer time-based strategy twist to it.,5
"I loved the old game for PC, this is a lot like it. The whole pay to win aspect sucks though.",4
Loving it,5
,5
More EA bullshit. They could have made a real dungeon keeper game but instead we get this thing that's unworthy of the name. Get your act together EA.,1
Its so funn,5
Really good game and addicting... Just dont fall for the tricks to purchase gems,5
"This is a cash delivery system, not a game",1
Gave up and uninstalled after less than 10 mins. Dragon Breath spell seemed to freeze the game.,1
,5
Just don't use your gems,5
Nice tutorial,5
Cartoony,5
,4
"I like it so far, good graphics but crashed on me and won't let me log on :/",3
Good game,5
As soon as I started playing this game I couldn't put it down! Very well put together game.,5
So far love this game.. Recommend it:),5
,5
Its another hurry up and wait game.  Spend crystals to speed up building blahblahblah.,4
,5
Wish I get more gems for free some how,5
Neat,5
,5
This game is so much fun. I highly recommend it to everyone,5
"The game could have been awesome, but the In app purchase system is making it dead slow. waiting a day to dig a block, seriously ? Graphics are cool, ideas are good. Reminds me of Mighty Quest For Epic Loot.  DungeonKeeper 1 was the best... they should have sticked to something comparable.",1
Looks and runs great on my nexus 5 &7. Love that it syncs between my devices. A lot of fun to play.,5
Being a PC gamer I only heard great things about the original. I quickly downloaded and found that they just used a very similar formula to clash of clans that isn't nearly as fun.,1
,5
Garbage,1
I wish it was like the PC game. I don't like tht they turned it into more like a time management game. Freeplay mode would be awesome.  Will be reclaiming my MB on this one,3
this slappz,5
Thanks,4
The story is comedy n game play is fun.,5
Fun stuff.  Hope I don't have to pay money for upgrades,5
Fun,5
Swaaa,5
"This is a classic case of in app purchases done wrong. It is very easy to accidentally spend the real world currency equivalent, and everything scales in an obscene way , causing everything to be more expensive as time goes on when it was already overpriced to start. It could be a good game, if they could figure out real value. I'm not surprised EA is unable to do it given their track record. This game has a lot of promise, but I don't expect it to ever be realized.",2
,5
Very good game with silly humor,5
Finally!!!!,5
Very good,5
Awesome,5
This app rocks!!! Best game on the android market!,5
Great fun,5
Money,1
Great game!,5
,5
Good game,5
Fun,5
Very fun but like most mobile games just tries to encourage micro transactions,5
This game cannot be played without spending money or you have to wait too long (ie: not playing).  It is horrible.,1
This is a great dungeon builder/strategy game. It's very fun and has great graphics.,5
Its awesome I'll beat you,5
"Thrilled to see this games evil face, again. Loved it on PC. The tablet version is great. Like all free tablet games, it has pay to upgrade, or get boosts, options. That is the only thing that gets me, but the game is good enough to over look that detail.",5
Good,5
Excellent!,5
So far it is fun,5
Fun and addictive,5
Love it,5
"Most games with time commitment to resources noxious because they take so many re entries however the notion devising a place that is impenetrable, similar to a tower defense, is great. Awesome graphics great interface and a funny story line make this an excellent find",5
Super cool l9ve it,5
Used to own this game years ago for the PC.... so glad I can have it on my phone now!,5
Gggg,5
Hh,5
Good game,5
Great attitude yeehswwwww,5
Game,5
Awesome game.,5
Best freemium out yet!,5
Says it cannot connect,1
Loved the original. Hate this version. Wait 24 hours for an imp to dig a single block unless you pay. At least I can get the original for $6...,1
Like castle clash,5
"I was so excited to see Dungeon Keeper on my android as I had such fun playing the original. This? Disgusting display of greed. This is supposed to be a real time strategy game, not this mucked up tap once a day unless you pay insane amounts of money travesty.",1
Its like the original 1997 game with all the fun stripped out and replaced with micro transactions.,1
I f****** hate this game.... Don't waste your time and effort because when you reach level 2 it allows everyone to attack you and all of your resources..... My question is why can someone make a game like this in red alert style where the enemy are computer based people....,1
"They took a great, classic game and ruined it",1
"Got stuck at the 'connecting' screen for 15 minutes staight. Gave it that 15 minutes because I kinda grew up on my mom's pc version; but judging by the other comments, I would have just been disappointed anyway.",1
better to me then clash of clans,5
"This, like all other free to pay games, thrives in its ability to hit you up for cash and distract you from what little gaming experience there is. This kind of model is despicable EA. If the mobile game market continues at this rate then we will be in a sad state of affairs.",1
Pretty freaking good,4
Good game,5
Compete and utter in-app-purchase-packed garbage.  Shame on you EA for soiling the reputation of such a fondly-remembered game.,1
"Installed it, wouldn't open so I reinstalled it, and it keeps having several errors.",1
Good,5
A little different from the original back in the 90's but still good.,5
"Almost everything i could like in a game, really concidering getting the premium.",5
Great game,5
Very fun,5
Similar to old original,5
EASY is always good,5
Tristeh,4
People need to rebel against these pay to play games.  Deleted,1
Fun dungeon builder game,5
Game has deep level design and customization options. Gives a different perspective in the rpg genre. Worth the time to try it out.,5
very cool game,5
Great game love it.,5
Good mindless fun :),5
"The concept for a remake is OK but as far as sticking people into the game with only 2 imps and every little thing costs to advance without losing interest... at least give us a 3rd imp after achieving level 5 or something... come on EA, I know you want to make lots of money so your investors will be happy but also have some pride in being a game company for the gamers instead of wall street....",2
Played this game on the pc way back when. Happy to see it come back!,5
Fun game,5
I just want gems,5
I have never seen a game so filled with IAP. it cripples and destroys what could have otherwise been a great game.,1
"4 hours to clear a tile unless you spend gems, which you buy. A petty cash grab, just like 4.5/5 games like this rated highly by people who either don't mind shelling out tons of cash to 'play', or wait days to get things done and have no honest interest in games.  Trash.",1
Good time waster,5
I like the concepts although I wish there was a way in game to earn gems.,5
Nice little time killer. Just wish it worked offline.,5
This game is the best,5
Good game,5
A very complicated and much too detailed rip off of the basics within clash of clans. Made it not very much fun to play.,2
Just like the original,5
Great game really fun,5
Great game,5
Great game good concept really fun,5
Exelent,5
My fiance used to play this on his computer but the sounds on were rather annoying and on a tablet this game is just more user friendly,5
This game is mostly u wait then u pay then wait i like the first and second on the consols,1
Love it,5
Better then clash of clans easier,5
I would rate it higher if I could actually play it. Keeps giving me error code 7,1
So far so good,5
Great evenly paced game that is user friendly and easy to learn fun to master! Get it.,5
So happy to have thus game back,5
Great,5
Good game,5
"It certainly isn't a clone of DK2 but more like a hybrid of DK2 and Greed for Glory.  It gets a bit frustrating having to wait for builds and minions but the alternative is spending real money to get gems to speed things along. No thanks, I'll work on my patience. Still an entertaining game.",5
it takes up way too much space :(,1
Huge fan of the original. Excellent port and very happy to see Horny live and well. It will be eons before even the hardiest weed will dare to take root.,5
Soooooooo much fun!!!!!!,5
Sucks,1
"Plays great, has plenty to do and  they got the original voice actor!",5
K,5
Very fun and entertaining,5
Reminds me how much fun the original Dungeon Keeper was!,5
This game is awesome! I never got to play on PC and now it's available on smartphone! Download it and play! What are you waiting for?,5
Great game,5
"It says click the claim button on the quarry for some imp thing at the very start tutorial. No claim button, nothing works. Crap.",1
Fungame,5
"Loved the original 2,love this one!",5
JUST PLAY THE GAME,5
The game developers intentionally slow down game play to make you purchase in-app gems. What a rip off. This is the sad state that mobile gaming has reached.,1
excellent!,5
Yup,5
I love this game,5
Works great on my nexus 7.  I just hate having to wait for everything since i won't spend money to buy jems,4
This game requires in app purchases to do ANYTHING. It is utterly useless if you actually want a free game.  What an embarrassment to the Dungeon Keeper legacy.,1
I played dk 2 on pc. Cant wait to try it!!!!,5
Fun,5
While it does crash a lot it is still fun,5
Reminds me of the original pc game.,5
This a amazing game,5
Love it!,5
Wished it had a offline mode to this...hate having to keep starting over b/c of needing constant connection,5
"Great game, loads of fun!",5
Love it.,5
Dark and funny,5
Need to be able to navigate clicking and dragging puts fill dirt all over.  New to the game but im very pleased with it so far!,5
I like this app,4
The game is good it has a lot to do.,5
Only thing that sucks is 4 hours on rock digging,5
Happy raiding,5
good,5
"""The lord of the land approaches!""",5
Great game to pass time,5
Amazing graphics,5
So fun I love it,5
Awsome,5
I loved the original Bullfrog version....but micro pay = not for me.  Uninstalling,1
Works great on a galaxy note 3,5
Great play,5
Really good,5
"If this game had not been ""free to play"" it would have been great. As it stands you either have to spend hours waiting for anything to happen or lots of task dollars to speed things up. Fans of the real dungeon keeper games may feel nostalgic like I did, but there are other, better options out there. EA once again shows that they know nothing about making fun games and only care how much money they can squeeze out of you before you get bored with the game.",1
"Everything you do in the game has a paywall associated with it. You pay to mine, unless you want to wait 24 hours per block. You pay to summon minions. You pay to do anything. It could have been okay if they would have just charged an upfront cost. Don't let ""free to play"" fool you, EA isn't doing you a favor.",1
What an awesome game!,5
Usually not a fan of these types of games but I'm hooked,5
"Fun game, easy to learn",5
Good game love it,5
Old school feel new game,5
"This was one of my favorite PC games. I would gladly buy it, but unfortunately it is built on the in-app resource buy model, so I will  not contribute anything to what could be an awesome game.",1
Keeps breaking and just stops. Get it fixed,1
"I've loved dungeon keeper ever since I was a kid, brings back memories",5
"Dungeon Keeper and its sequel were an absolute riot in the past days of pc gaming! To see it resurrected for mobile devices gives my little black heart the shivers! Although the game is fun, I think it missed the mark of the original... Still great game!",4
Fun,5
Memories,5
"I loved the original games but EA has sunk to a new low baiting us with this. It takes hours to dig anything, the dungeon design element of the game is practically gone, and of course to really advance u have to pay for boosts. U suck EA.",1
Addictive,5
Fun game!,5
Awesome,5
"Very fun game. It's a great twist on tower defense, with the added awesomeness of a strategy game. Great job!",5
they should come out with a part 2,5
Good,4
Good,5
I used to play this on CPU when I was young.  Nice trip down memory lane.,5
Nice,5
This game rocks,5
...speechless...  :0,5
The old DK I miss with a new twist.,5
Love the game so far!,5
Goog game,5
"Sort of retains some of the DK vibe (in that ""squint and tilt your head sideways"" sort of way), but really it's just like any other micro transaction crapfest out there.   I was so excited to see a DK title too, but I was left with disappointment. Sad to say, but it's a delete/uninstall for me.",2
U should play this game its cool,4
Just starting out and enjoying myself. Have been kicked a couple of times so that's annoying.,5
Kool,5
Loads of fun,5
Great game I love it,5
bring back for pc,5
Great game! Reminds me of the old classic,5
A wonderful throw back to Dungeon Keeper 2.,5
Rip off of clan wars,3
Premium for $7.50 a WEEK.,1
Very cool,5
.,5
"Reminds me if old do a little, having a blast",5
Super entertaining.,5
Excellent,5
Not spending a penny on it though.,5
Try it,5
Long live Bullfrog.,5
Fun and very sadistic,5
Gonna be comparing this to CoC as I play.,5
Good game and I love how it operates and runs seamlessly perfect on my phone,5
"I really wanted to enjoy this game. I honestly wish I could have just paid for the game and be able to play it instead of Free-to-wait/pay-to-play.   I eventually reached a choke point at Dungeon Heart level 3, where I needed 50k Stones to upgrade it. The problem is that I am capped at a maximum of 34,500 Stones. In order to build a second Warehouse, I need to upgrade my Dungeon Heart. In order to upgrade my Warehouse I need to upgrade my Dungeon Heart.   Problem is I cannot upgrade my Dungeon Heart because it is physically impossible for me to save enough Stone to do so.",3
Stay away from this!!!,1
Unless someone could tell me WHY I was getting error 1 and it wouldn't update.... then I hate this game,2
Its about time.,5
One of the worst pushes for in app purchases I've tried. TT here's no game here.,1
"Here you have a timeless classic; a gem of a franchise, completely destroyed by RIDICULOUS in-app purchasing pricing. $99 for 14k gems?! Do you know how quickly you run out of those things?! And waiting a whole day for burrowing?   Leave it to EA to muck things up.   I'd rather pay $19 ONCE and play a solid DK sequel than this garbage.",1
Love this game,5
Awesome game,5
Fun,5
"I love the voices, the graphics are unmatched. Great game",5
I remember this game.....,5
Play it while your clash of clans armies are building!,5
Awesome : ),5
Awesome game!,5
If I could would be 0 stars can't even play server error since I downloaded it. I guess it's an EA thing.,1
I use to play this all the time on the pc. Love the updated graphics. Fun for all ages. Lol,5
"Good graphics and great humour, but required constant attention.  This made it a battery killer.",3
Lots of different ways to play and a great way to spend time,5
Fun game and gets you thinking.,5
But ive only managed to play the one minute intro level. Every other time it says cant connect and then promptly goes to the home screen. :(,2
"Started out thinking this game would be lame, but for a tower defense type it's pretty fun!",5
Gonna own,5
Nice way to waste time.,5
"Better than castle clash, clash of clans, or any clashing clash thing lol. Clever game verry funny.",5
Pretty good,5
Very cool,5
"Its okay, im bein generous by rating it high.. but to turn one of bullfrogs greatest game franchises into a pay-to-win, microtransaction Sims free play game is kinda crappy...",5
Grew up playing this game on my computer now I can play it once again best game on my phone in my opinion!,5
Wouldn't even load :(,1
Uninstalled because you're forced to share with Google+.,1
Above,5
Cool game,5
With some new twists and strategies,5
Awesome,5
Fun to learn,4
Fun game.,5
Keeps you playing for hours.,5
Lots of fun. Easy to play,5
Only let's you rate 5 stars in game. Otherwise you need to manually rate.,1
5 stars.,5
Love it.  Reminds me of the original.,5
Lots of funn,5
a new approach to this genre,5
I loved the original PC game and this one doesn't disappoint! Definite must play! (:,5
It seems like I'm waiting to play more then I'm actually playing. IAP's are high. Occasionally I may spend up to $5 on a game if I like it but I don't think that would get me any thing on here compared to what I've bought on others so I will not be spending cash here. I'll play this until I get tired of waiting to play.,3
I like it alot its fun if your into clash of clans or any time based strategy game,5
Great game,5
Very intertaining game,5
Good game,5
Great game super fun I love it.,5
Can't even try it out just keep getting an error code 7 so.        /uninstall,1
Good game,5
Love the game sane feel add the pc versions great job. Hope that you keep adding to it because the pc games always seemed to short. I would like to see more in game earning of gems but it's still a good game.,5
"The game looks so good and its slot of fun to spend time on, no complaints.",5
Great game. Its an alternative to building castles.,5
24hours on blocks or pay? No thanks. Stop being so fing greedy.,1
Constantly disconnected and starts over from beginning.  Have to close app each time and hope it works to do anything.,3
"What a shame that such a good IP has been mired down and screwed over by poorly done f2p mechanics. The timers are atrocious and long much like that star trek game its timer upon timer in an attempt to wear you down so you buy their crystals. It makes you wonder if all the 5 stars are people that have extra cash to burn or PR control from ea.  It's almost sinful to have this share the name of a beloved bullfrog IP, which ironic considering the devil is in the game.",1
"Like the witty humour, graphics are good, and the game play is great",5
Alot of fun,5
"Good concept, keeps ya on your toes",5
"Microtransactions bring the game to a dead stop, and make the game unplayable unless you are willing to shell out a fortune to continue. It's such a shame too, the underlying gameplay showed signs of being great fun before it was ruined with pay-to-win garbage.",1
Good game,5
Great game so far,5
"I was really hopeful when I spotted this game. The original Dungeon Keeper is one of the best computer games ever. This game shares very little with it. Almost every mechanic has been changed, making this game too similar to many other mobile games.",1
Great so far,5
Fun and easy to jump right in,5
This was a fabulous standalone game. This is how you ruin a game.  Sleep well programmers.  I don't see how you can.,1
Great game but missing minor tweeks,5
Best game ever,5
They took a great game & turned it into a Farmville dungeon builder. Fail.,3
So far so good. Very entertaining!,5
I love the idea and reminds me of a certain game but still I LOVE it,5
I allready have to wait. Let alone wait to load the game,1
Love everything so far about it,5
Fun builder to play.,5
Tacos,5
This game is really fun and entertaining.,5
Very addicting!,5
Good game,5
What an awful pay to play scam by EA.,1
Gives dungeon keeper a bad name,1
Reminds me of overlord,5
Fun,5
"I had a copy of the original Dungeon Keeper that I used to play all the time, but the disc got scratched and is unplayable. I was so happy to see this app. This version is different, but still fun.",5
Great game,5
Awesome,5
Cool,5
Awsome,5
Great game!,5
Not bad so far,4
Addictive.  Fun.,5
This game is awesome. Similar to the old dungeon keeper. Glad I downloaded it.. love the good old slap from the original though.,5
Great fun,5
"More of the same old pay to play b.s. you log on once a day for a min and then wait till tomorrow till your stuff is done. How is this considered ""playing?""",1
Great fun and very funny,5
very good game.,5
Similar in spirit to the classic Dungeon Keeper Titles on the pc which are a personal favorite of mine.,5
Good,5
"Great graphics and overall production value, but the game itself is really slow. It was fun for a bit, but it got boring quickly while waiting to build resources to buy things that offer little payoff.",3
Engaging,5
Great game. Reminds me of the old one,5
"Holy cow. This is the worst I've ever seen the ""energy system"" be. It's terrible. Terrible! Good luck doing anything without spending anything",2
Nice easy had no problems so far.,5
Great game,5
Little slow at first,5
Very strategic game that is completely competitive,5
"Great game, enjoy every second",5
Nothing like the original. Why must they ruin games,1
Worth the space,5
Great game,5
Not exactly like the original but a great adaptation for tablets.,5
Poor,1
Nice game,5
With the in app purchases you can buy the original game about 20 times.,1
So far so good,5
"Awesome game when it works, but it crashes after pretty much every raid. Nexus 7.",2
I love this game is a kid.  it's not as much fun as the original so far but pretty darn close.,5
Very fun CNT stop plyn,5
...,5
Way more fun than it should be.,5
Like a dungeon version of clash but much better than the other clash like games play store has tried,5
Worth a try!,5
Great,5
Responsive interface and nice graphics. Don't understand why the single player mode requires an internet connection. Forces you to play the tutorial before anything else (including accepting and oversized EULA),1
"Great game.  I miss the original pc game, but at least this is close.",5
Sweet graphics,5
Fun game!  Nice twist on a COC type game.,5
It's fun,5
Amazing,5
Great game I have found no problems so far,5
Fun,5
Its like a version of the old one 5 star I hope it just gets better with the updates.,5
"Fun to play, smooth mapping, and Awesome sound... Great game",5
Baller,5
Fun stuff,5
"There's too many build up and let u down apps out there, so we'll see.",5
"Was expecting a port, got another freemium nagfest instead. Still fun so far",5
Love it,5
Wow,5
Super fun,5
"It reminds me of the old keeper game,  just with pvp and waiting.",5
Garbage.,1
koo,5
Like the computer game.  Transitioned well to mobile.  Enjoy.,5
Such a great game ruined by in game purchases.,1
Excellent game...,5
Its fun,5
Pretty good game so far,5
Love the dark n twisted gameplay,5
This game might as just bury Bullfrog's name it's just Clash of Clans skinned with Dungeon Keeper... It is horrid that such a good game that DK was ruined by EA Games in a attempt to profit from a pay to win bullshit maiming an old good game. I rather burn than play this P.O.S. game remade and rehashed for the big money spenders to p2w... How many more games are you going to ruin EA games?     Tell me because I still own the original Dungeon Keeper disk and it doesn't suck like this rehashing crap.,1
Amazing game really enjoyed it,5
Awesome,5
Fun,5
Excellent mixture of genres from dungeon to strategy and tower defense,5
Awesome tutorial guys,5
Fun so far... dont forget to slap your imps,5
It is a very good game,5
Fun to play when clash of clans workers are all tied up.,5
Great game,5
The way the battle feel is created makes me wanna play it a ton. Epic game gg.,5
Real cool,5
What the title says,5
"Awesome, and fun.",5
Fun,5
Good game. Very addictive,5
Awesome,5
"I tried it...and I liked it... Great characters, humor & intuitive GUI. WELL DONE!",5
"The voice work, writing, and sounds are all whimsically demented, in the best way possible",5
"It's super fun and seems really well balanced c: I love the voice acting on ""Horny""    Keep updating!",5
Really addicting fun game,5
"Great game, really fun",5
This game is a micro transaction nightmare.  Expect to pay-to-win.,1
Never thought I could make my own raid... Until now!,5
Love this dungeon feel to a classic game,5
Man I would recommend this app to all your friends. It's 100% free and its one of my favorites game to play when I was younger.,5
Awesome game so far,5
Its good no ads and very unique pay to win,5
Great fun!,5
So far seems like a great game,5
"Reminds me of the old pc game, but updated for now.",5
I can't even play it! It's to laggy. So much that the music is making a high pitched screech!,1
Power house,5
Fun,5
Good show,5
5 stars,5
Game starts asking for money early on.  Just a shallow of the previous Dungeon Keeper.  Start away from this one.,1
.ti evol,5
"Low fps on slower phones, would be great if I had something like a droid",5
Great game.,5
Something different about this game,5
I enjoy playing the upgrade 2k chess lol,5
Thas mah niggah,5
After loving the original I tried this. No. Do not play. Stains the franchise name.,1
One of the best games on play store,5
Fun,5
Good so far,5
Good,5
Great time spender,5
Epic sauce,5
"Awesome, and funny game",5
Bullfrog did it better..was more creepy and not as childishüòâ,5
Great,5
Like the original,5
Playing on my nexus 7 32GB,5
"This is a throwback to all the games I used to play when I was a kid! I dug up my Dad's old Dungeon Keeper game last week, and i am so glad there is an amazing mobile game just like it!!! HIGHLY RECCOMEND",5
Not as fun as the original but still decent,5
This game is pretty good.  Nice play so far.,4
Addicting,5
Hard to play without spending a lot of money. Unwanted push notifications from game. Wants a lot of permissions with my Google+ account.  EA definitely destroyed this great franchise... One more.,2
I love it,5
Good,5
"The only way to avoid massive wait times is to use gems, and other than that there is little to no actual gameplay.",1
Addictive,5
A+,5
Kool,5
"Dont waste your time.... I'm a big fan of dungen keeper, but this is a rape to your wallet and a insult on out intelligence.  Mircotransaction! 4.99 for 500 gems so about 100 a dollar but 99.99 for only 14,000 when you need gems to actually pay the game and not wait days on end build ing ans waiting for resources to build up. A shame....",1
"I fell in love with Simpsons tapped out after playing Sims free play so I decided to search EA in the play store and I'm glad I did lol this game, even though I just started today has already made me happy. I would give this game 5 stars all day long lol",5
Awesome game,5
Yep.,5
Fun fun fun!,4
"This is another example of an app that isn't actually a game, really just a test of your patience to capitalize on micro transactions. This is the kind of game that is ruining mobile gaming.",1
I played this game years ago and it was fun then soooooo ya good game,4
"Fun, strategic",5
Wont play. Wont load on motorola3.,1
K,5
Refreshing,5
"Game play is interesting. I loved the original Dungeon Keeper games. The free to play model ruins this game. Gems run everything and cost real money. Your imps can mine them, but at a rate of 9 per 24 hour period. At that rate, I'll be able to afford a third imp in roughly 90 days. Make gems easier to come by, introduce persistent bonuses (not pay per use bonuses), and/or reduce the cost of gems. Please.",3
Great game,5
Love it...,5
Above statement,5
Soooooooooo coooooool,5
No comment,5
Love love love it reminds me of when I was a kid on the computer playing it sooo fun,5
Excellent game,5
Sweetness,5
Yay,5
Awesome,5
Its fun,4
I've always loved these games and I still do this app makes me so nostalgic,5
LG G2 Game seemed great. Loved smacking the imps. I didn't level enough to pvp but I thought it was great the campaign allowed you to attack and defend your base missions. Hope it works one day. Five stars if it works on my device.,5
I'm really surprised at the depth of DK. Loads of  fun to keep of player engaged,5
Very poorly done. The franchise deserves better. You can't even excavate large areas. Nostalgic fans like me will be very disappointed. Do not install.,1
Worth the price. Memories. Free always buys them.,5
Just try it out,5
Fun Great game,5
Great,5
Great game,5
Its very addictive.,5
Doesnt work..,1
Awesome,5
Was one of my favorite games growing up and I'm so happy it was redone!!!!,5
Awesome.mix,5
"Keeps things interesting, fun, defiantly enjoyable to smack the imp workers.",5
Great game. Awesome graphics for tablets,5
Its fun,5
What can I say it's dungeon keeper!,5
Game,5
Yeah,5
Its good stuff!!,5
Great  game,5
Cool similar to the original,5
takes some time..,5
"Is good IH Nuh Cruz Rev PKK, vnyr/yguhnm Loki t/w",5
"Not the original, but good for what it is",5
Great stroll down memory lane. It's good to be bad.,5
Love this game owned both dk 1 and 2 on the computer when i was younger glad i seen this on the play store today,5
In app purchases destroy any fun.,1
"Brings back great memories, very similar to the old games.",5
Epic fun for hours non-stop,5
"I downloaded this with excitement as I had played the older versions for PC.  The game play is completely different, and to top it off, it takes hours just to mine out a room!  On a good note, the graphics are great.   If you love Dungeon Keeper, don't try this game.   You will be disappointed.",2
Fun,5
Like to see it get a little darker!,5
I love this app,5
YAY,5
bol troll,5
Loads of fun,5
"Even though it's nothing like the old one, it still has that sense of humor.",5
Fantastic game,5
I can slap my minions enuff said u cant beat that,5
This game is exactly what I wanted.,5
Great game,5
Good,5
Fun,5
Very Addictive ;),5
Everyone should try this,5
"I loved this game on the pc when I  was younger, I was so happy to see it available. Different than the original but definitely fun.",5
Fun,5
One of the best tower defense game other than baloons tower defense.,5
Fun,5
Love,5
I dig it,5
This game is awesome! Even with the in-app purchases I'm surprised that the devs gave it free!,5
Awesome,5
Reminds me of the classic Dungeon Keeper 2,5
I had this game series for my pc years ago. Just as great on android.,5
Awesome,5
Great mobile make from the original. Support this and support the new remake Lord of the Overworld. Hopefully that will come out soon. Cheers.,5
Excepting in this game is made to make you pay. Go buy the original game instead.,1
Game seems cool but it wouldn't load.  :(,2
Works great on galaxy s4 i545 running Cyanogen 10.2,5
It sent back in time.,1
I'm having tons of fun with it,5
Not bad at all,5
Easy to play,5
So fun,5
This is great game,5
Love. It,5
Awesome game,5
Good stuff.,5
i haf this game on my pc. and i lost it after upgrading my pc. now i can play it on my phone awsome.!,5
Funn,5
Great game,5
Great game,5
Just got it and I can't put it down,5
Love it my old game I played on pc.,5
Pimp game,5
And I like that game too.,5
Android version of a classic,5
Microtransactions ruined this game. Don't spend a cent on this nonsense.,1
I love it remember the old times,5
"I used to play this as a kid and it was one of my favorites.  I actually still have the media for the old PC version.  Unfortunately, they changed it into a slow and painful game that benefits those that want to shell out cash for small meaningless perks. There's no longer quality but cheapness and the attempt to make a cheap buck. I feel sorry for EA, honestly. I guess only time will tell if this model of gaming will pay off or not.",1
Nicely done EA thanks for the great game.,5
Awesome game,5
An excellent recreation of a great game. Lots of fun.,5
It's exactly what I expected from EA. DK with microtransactions. If you've played Castle Clash then you're familiar with the concept. So as far as these kinds of games go the cost and wait times are pretty bad. You'll wait a long time for anything to complete and there's no easy/quick way to get the uber currency via special offers (though special events allow you to win a few every now and again. I think for what you get there are better and more generous games than this.,2
So far so good!,5
I played about 3 hours and then it started performing updates and has not stopped for an entire day.  Plus you need gems to advance in game and only realistic way of obtaining is by purchasing them.  Could be awesome.,2
Great game,5
Hate wating,5
Great job guys!,5
"Really cool game, must get if you're feeling evil =). One thing though, a but slow to get resources",5
"Loved this game when I was younger, excited to see it being re-released",5
Really fun,5
"I got through the tutorial and started playing just to have to wait 24 hours for things to happen.  Then I came back, clicked and now I have to wait another 24 hours.  This ""game"" is lame.",1
Its amazing! And a ton of fun! Insta addict!,5
A lot like the classic... dig it.,5
Great game must get,5
Sick game?,5
"Won't  work plzz fix   Shows error ,than I'll give five stars",1
It's so cool,5
Great game,5
I just love to slap minions around! I may have to run for office!,5
Amazing,5
It keeps saying error code 7,2
Great. Reminded of the old game on pc,5
The most fun ive had on my tablet!,5
Excellent graphic and enjoyable game,5
Fun game,4
Amazing,5
Very enjoyable,5
Brings back memories of playing the original series.,5
Cool game,5
Can't put down runs fine,5
Game don't save like it should.  Have to repeat a lot of my same actions and hope it saves. Hate repeating special when stuff is time based,2
Very cool game Am,5
I liked it on the plays ration and enjoy it on my tablet now.,5
This game is a hollow husk of the original. Nothing but a pathetic cash grab. It hardly even qualifies as a game.,1
Great,5
So far i enjoy it,5
Stops working right after the load screen. Looks fun but I can't play it. Please fix.,1
Fun game love it!,5
I can't put to words how bad it is compared to the original.,1
Pretty good game,4
Loved the old dungeon keeper on PC. This is obviously more like a castle building game but still has all those great evil themes to it.,5
This game rocks,4
Fun game,5
Kool,5
Addicting,5
Don't expect classic dungeon keeper. Buy for a mobile phone game complete in 3d. Its a good game :)	Imp slapping so much fun,5
Great on content,5
This game is very addicting,5
Awesome game,5
As addictive as it's PC version,5
Dungeon Keeper skin on Clan Wars game. Hope Evil Genius doesn't suffer similar fate.,1
"This is not a game. This is a horrible, horrible cash grab.  You can't accomplish anything without paying real money for it. EA should be attached of themselves.",1
Here's an idea buy the original for $5.00 instead of paying money to dig tiles up that you could do for FREE in the original. Seriously people learn when company's are taking your money.,1
Enjoy the game,5
It's nice to see old games reinvented like this,5
Not like the original but it is enjoyable.,5
Well made game. Definitely reccomend,5
"I remember when I played a similar game on the computer, but now it won't work. This game brings back memories.",5
Obviously comparable to clash of clans but still very good. Not super battery friendly but could be worse.,4
Fun,5
Awesome,5
Fun time killer,5
"Really enjoying it so far, a fun and unique experience!",5
Its rlly fun,5
Fun game,5
Great game all around,5
"Worked the first time I opened it, no longer even opens, just black screen.",1
Get your wallet out and start to empty it for EA. This game is utterly unplayable. Not a throwback to the original DK at all.,1
Nice game,5
Great game so far.,5
Awesome,5
Amazing game super fun,5
This is a great game not to difficult not to demanding,5
Love it,5
Koo game i like it so far,5
Great fun just like the old DK 1&2. I loved it then and I love it now!,5
It keeps saying code 7 everything,1
Its pretty fun,5
All this time to dig one block and the amount of greed by the developers is disgusting.  It was a much better experience on the computer.,1
Great,5
This game is so much fun to play!!!!,5
I always enjoy being the bad guy :),5
Doesn't work Error 7,1
Epic,5
"Man up and develop a good game, then charge what it is worth.",1
Best game,5
Awesome game,5
Awesome,5
Pretty fun,5
Both fun and addictive! Makes for a great way to kill time and think a little too.,5
All the great flavor of DK ... Very fun!,5
This is a great game.,5
Really fun,5
Yup!,5
Awesome game so cool and really addicting,5
Yep....,5
Looked good until it crashed an stayed frozen,1
Don't know how to express this experience,5
Great game,5
Good,5
Cool,5
Great,5
The game is easy and fun.,5
Doesnt get old!,5
It's dungeon keeper meets clash of clans,5
Very fun,5
"Still, want to be able to possess an imp to make sure he is at the right wall.",5
Best Game ever,5
This game is a dungeon keeper rip off of city builder games like clash of clans. Zooming and moving the camera is bad and I keep excavating blocks I don't mean to and moving rooms. Progress is slow. Even after three days of upgrades you have to log in every 3 hrs to not waste resources.  Social aspect of game is almost non existent,2
Really fun,5
Really good,5
Awesome,5
This game is great if you enjoyed the game on PC,5
You need to connect to my google account and harass my contacts? And wants in your entire google profile..f you and your nsa bs. ITS SUPPOSE TO BE A GAME. G A M E!,1
This is a cool,5
"This is a cash grab,  masquerading as a game! Negative stars...",1
Excellent,5
"I'm going to start by saying that while I own the first two, I haven't played much of them. However from what I have played, for what you pay, it's far better then having this game constantly henpeck you to give them money. I see a lot of things I could enjoy in this game, but it's designed from the ground up to season money directly from my account. Not to mention the downright shameless popup that they use to get you to rate it 5 stars. Please, don't spend money on this farce. Buy the originals on PC.",1
Its a promising game and could have been a lot of fun.  But the pay to play model has sucked all of the fun out of this.,1
A good time killer,5
Great,5
Awesome remake!!!!!,5
"This is a truly terrible, terrible.game. its the worst example of pay to win, I was super excited up until I opened the game. Loved the pc versions and played them for many years. Don't encourage terrible game making and skip this horrendous waste of time.",1
IOVE it I reccomend it 100%,5
So far,5
Great game,5
Not a game,1
"Do you like waiting 24 hours for your imps to dig out a 1X1 square?  Do you like playing a short battle/defense sequence where you are mostly a spectator?  Do you like spending gobs of money on microtransactions?  Then this game is for you!  This game is the epitome of what is wrong with ""free to play"" gaming.  Don't waist your time with this...go buy the original on Good Old Games for a few bucks.",1
Awsome,5
So awesome,5
"I played this on the pc, 2 decades ago and enjoyed it.",5
Such cash grab.,2
Very entertaining game.,5
"Garbage, plain and simple. This is not dungeon keeper, this is ea giving a giant middle finger to the entire world. Get the real version on good old games. Ea has once again proven why they suck as a publisher.",1
Fun time üòÇ,5
I remember this game from long long ago.  Its nice to see the same spirit living on in this iteration,5
Great,5
Awesome,5
Good,5
This was my favorite computer game and I just recently bought it again I hope it's as good as the old pc version,5
Love,5
Ehh...,1
"Good game, definitely need to play this!!",5
Nice game it gliched  a bit before I might have fixed it but I would Iike u to check it out and see what u can do plz thank you,5
Awesomeness game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Rts meets tower d meets tap city! Lol so fun....and eeeevil!,5
Nice to spend some time,4
Enjoyable and humorous,5
I like this game its really good thanks for this amazing game XD,5
Awesome,5
Great app.,5
Awesome game.  I love it,5
Good Game,5
I honestly think that this game is better then clash of clans please download it,5
Good game - just wish they would add support for the Stylist on the galaxy note.,5
Great game,5
Just awesome,5
Loved the PC version. Excellent.,5
Enjoyed original. This is a nice homage,5
"Fun, that's all you need to know.",5
Like CoC but feels a lot more interactive,5
Great game,5
Just like dungeon keepers in the past,5
This game is awesome!,5
A lot like the old pc game but better,5
"This game is a horror. Microtransactions are the only way to progress, unless you want to wait a infuriating amount of time. Ruined the feel of the series altogether.",1
"Just like my favorate game, but better!!!",5
Though it's not like the old school DK for the pc. It still brings me joy to slap my imps :P,5
Good,5
Yeah. I have no complaints.,5
Great game,5
Good,5
Good,5
So much better than Clash of Clans,5
Charge 3 bucks for a game and leave it alone. Micro transactions are ruining tablet and phone games,1
Not enough content before the game starts hitting you up for real money. Prices are outrageous as are task times for digging/building. Just made me want to play the original again.,1
"Really cool they made Dungeon Keeper for mobile and not that bad art and sound effects, it's a little fun. Brings back memory's of playing Dungeon Keeper 2. Only problem is that it takes way to long to do anything and is hard to get gems unless you buy them with real world money. It takes a entire day just for a imp to take down one block to get vary little amount of gems. This is a insult to the original Dungeon Keeper games. DK is a strategy game not begs for your money and waist your time game.",2
Just like old times I just wish it was a full game for pc.,5
Very nice for now + like the graphics,5
Reminds me of the old one dungeon keeper,5
Lots of fun,5
A lot of fun to play. Quick game you can have some fun with in your free time,5
Non stop toilet fun,5
Waay to many in app purchases.. The full version of this game for PC costs $6.99 right now. I'd have to spend $50+ on android to get the exact same experience!,1
Love it!,5
Intuitive and attractive game,5
This game is mad funny I like everything about it  best game I played :-),5
Ea took a great game and turned it into a greedy cash grab.,1
Awsome,5
Great game,5
Yolo,5
Great,5
Very good game so far just got it so I'll see how it goes from here so far I like the graphics and silly chars. EA usually makes really good games so I'll be expecting a bit more from this free app compared to others,5
Fun fun,5
Sweet game finally,5
Good,5
Fun,5
Would not open on my NTE Avid. Never went past opening scene. Kept looking for updates. EA sucks. Stick to kiddie games,1
Great game to play,5
Best game ever,5
The timer kills this game. In  app currency is bogus to. I want to change my dungeon I either have to spend a bunch of money or wait three hours. It was fun for a very short while. Uninstalled this one.,2
Cash grab,1
Fun,5
Wow fun game,5
Great game so far,5
I used to live this game as a kid. They did a great job with the app!,5
Awesome,5
Hj,5
Cool,5
How could you think this is OK? Take hours to remove a single block! Wtf were you people thinking? This is the worst demonstration of free2play and pay2win that's I've ever seen. This game should not be allowed on the market.,1
Addicting,5
Love it,5
"Game is fun, but timer delays are way too high",2
Fun,5
"Great game, building things takes a while though.",5
Love it,5
Will give clash of clans a run for there money.,5
Fun game,5
Have fun playing this add teams,5
"Once again, another amazing game ruined with a freemium model. What a lousy rip off.",1
"Game seems ok, but with device turning off after every move it's more aggravating to play than it's worth.",2
Entertaining game,5
I love this game its just like coc,5
Good to c the old games come back,5
Great game!,5
Works well on my s4 and is a great time killer,5
Micro-transactions.,1
Doesn't work.,1
If I could scroll around the screen or zoom in and out. Unplayable.,1
Very neat game,5
Much? Almost an exact clone.,3
EA sucks. Yay microtransactions.,1
Simply genius!,5
:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-),5
Nothing but a cheap cash-in. Disgrace to the Dungeon Keeper series.,1
Great game,5
Love it,5
Good way to spend your bored hours!!,5
Bad transactions and gem to time  other wise good,4
After finishing the tutorial it asked me to rate the game... at that time I would have given it 5 stars... after a couple more minutes I found myself at a stand still... unless I have $5 or more to spend on gems... i'm going to have to wait at least another 3.5 hours for my imps to finish breaking down a couple walls... to get 1 more imp they want 800 gems or roughly $8 in gems... kind of a disappointment seeing as I can buy a full game for less than that.,1
Great game. No bugs. Addictive. Haha,5
Great game havnt been able to put down since I started,5
Not bad gave it a 5,5
Great,5
I really wanted to like this game but it requires a lot of money,1
So far I like it.  Hope the fun continues,5
Keep getting booted off server. Loses connection wayyy to often. The real kicker is last time i lost connection i also lostbmy game and hours of upgrading. I refuse to start over. Not worth it. Fix your bugs....cause they suck!! Thought EA. GAMES would do better. Guess not.,1
Game,5
I have both DK1 and 2,5
Fun!!!,5
Uujj,5
Lots of fun,5
It's good so far,5
Fun game,5
Get it,5
"5 stars help you provide free updates ? Thats a pretty cheap way to boost your rating EA	Not surprising coming from your corporate greed driven company though, so carry on",4
F4g t,5
U,4
awesome,5
Amazing,5
Enjoy everything about it,5
Great game,5
Need easier way to get gems,5
Sweet game,5
"Very fun, addicting and exciting game!",5
Amazing,5
Fun,5
Excellent,5
It's not the same as the original pc version but still fun.,4
doesn't seem difficult but WHY OH WHY are the gems only for purchase. It doesn't make sense to require so much gems when you can only earn 5 gems an achievement...ridiculous...,3
This is an awesome game,5
Great game,5
Look,5
Nice game. Fun,5
Fun game. Love the tower defense like game play.,5
It's good,5
"Love it, it is awesome having tons of fun",5
"I used to adore dungeon keeper, saw this saw EA and almost cried. Forget the original this is clash of (insert misc name here) with a dungeonkeepers skin. Uninstalled.",1
"The game is fun, I have played for about an hour now. It uses the much loved waiting game that many developers resort to in an effort to force you to use their micro transaction system. Kinda sad but the game is still fun and still feels very Dungeon Keeper-ish.",4
Force you to wait when you just want to play the stupid game.,1
Very fun and I like turtles,5
This is th coolest game ever,5
Awesomeness,5
Good,5
Great game.  Need more demons and upgrades stuff.  Hopefully it will in the updates,5
Best game ever,5
Awesome game,5
"I know it's just a carbon copy of Clash of Clans, but I've loved the DK series since the original, and this is about as entertaining an adaptation as I could expect on mobile.",5
Good so far on a tablet.,4
Good,5
Fun builder game,5
"But they micro transactioned the hell out of it.  If feels good for the first hour or so and then it becomes clear you will have to spend a ton of money to get anything done.  $8 US for a stupid little imp is outrageous.  The imp only allows you to do one extra action, but since most of the actions take 4hours to 1 day its no where worth the money.  Great game‚Ä¶.to bad EA got greedy!  If you have lots of money to burn, you might like this game.  If you care about your money you might want to pass.",1
Its really good. I enjoy how they introduce it.,5
Great game,5
Good,5
"It's fun, and unique! Definitely get this game.",5
"I loves the Old Dungeon Keeper games and the Spin-off Overlord games so this was already a big hit with me. I'll be playing this for a while. Well done, EA.",5
Love it,5
Great,5
:),5
Really smooth and nice gameplay,5
I played the pc version and loved itand when I saw there was an app it was auto download for me.,5
Awesome,5
Simple and addictive. My new guilty pleasure.,5
Just great,5
Great game kinda like clash of clans,5
Fun,5
Fun game.,5
"Close to some other ""clash"" games but you get to be the bad guy.  A nice twist.",5
Loved this game back in the day glad I get to play it again,5
Thanks for killing my childhood EA,1
Great new take on the genre.,5
I wish there was a bit bigger map more building variety and walls would be nice,5
"Either you don't mind waiting hours to do anything. Or you want to spend an excessive amount of real money, then this is the game for you. Besides that, this is a lot like the classic dungeon keeper.",4
"The original DK and it's sequel were masterpieces - this game is a trite knock off cashing in on the name. If you feel like logging in once a day to tap a single block and then log back out, this game was built for you!",1
code 7. can't get past dungeon keeper screen. all my other online games work fine. I loved this game for computer would love to beable to play it,1
Very good,5
Great game,5
"Pretty graphics, great sound, but full of in-app purchase requirements. This game is only free to INSTALL, not to play. Terrible.",1
Love the game,5
"I like the feel of the game so far, great design.",5
Best game and fun,5
Okay,5
Cool,5
Had the original two games. Glad to see it back and kicking. Fun so far. Voice acting is fantastic for horny the demon,5
Would be a cool game if everything didnt take hours to do but don't worry you can pay to make the game go faster. Isn't that fun,2
Awesome game! One of my favorites,5
"Yes it's free, but to accomplish anything costs way too much.",1
Great,5
Coolio,5
"How can you people be giving this crap 5 stars? In fact how can you be giving it anything but 1 star? It's a terrible cash grab. The original Dungeon keeper was nothing like this, we didn't have to wait hours upon hours just to mine a 4x4 room you got it done in seconds. The maps were never this puny there were much larger and didn't feel so linear. Can't you see they are testing us to see just how much money they can grind out of us? My advice; go download a Windows 98 Emulator and download the original",1
Fun and addicting!,5
Love this game but the instructions are a lot to take in and memorize in one sitting	If u like clash of clans then u will love this,4
A great port of an amazing game! I haven't stopped playing it since I saw it was available.,5
Love how it brings a old game series back with a bit of style.,5
Cant play the game it black screens then takes me back to my home screen. Pls fix,1
Entertaining,5
"Great graphics, free. Whats not to like? ? Get it, try it, see for yourself!",5
i missed playing this game wheni was little,5
Much like the original its a great time waster,4
Time passer,5
One of my first games is back on my handheld  and it is good,5
Great way to pass the time when the boss isnt watching,5
Stuff,5
Nice game,5
Cool game but the in-game purchases kind of killed it otherwise I would have given it 5/5. Would rather pay a 1 time purchase fee instead of buying gems to complete days and days worth of waiting...,3
You can do anny thing,5
It's fun and addicting and I like the way that the game is designed,5
Great game,5
"Loved it as a kid, great phone app!",5
Love it,5
This is a great version of one of my favorite games.  Thanks for bringing it back!,5
In-app purchases are atrocious. Not worthy of the original series.,1
This game plays very nicely. I really like the feature of earning/mining gems rather than buying them.,5
This is a really cool and funny game I think you guys should lower the prices on the imps summons but good job on everything else and on the next update put global chat and guild chat. :),5
Loooooove &lt;333,5
I enjoy it,5
Best game so far :),5
It is a game that keeps you involved,5
It keeps saying error code 7 fix it  ...,2
Its a good game,5
Thanks,5
I love this game. Its the best game In the world.,5
Fun,5
This brings back memories! Way to go EA!,5
Y,5
Cool game like it,5
This game is addictive,5
Why make it a time management game? I hate that crap. Just make a full version like the pc one then sell it. You ruined a once great game,1
Yup good stuff lol,5
"You are goaded into giving the game 5-star reviews for gems. Even if you read some of the reviews, you can tell that these people have only played the tutorial before reviewing and wouldn't REALLY give this game 5 stars. It's a sick ploy to undeservedly elevate the game. Grow a brain, let this game sink.",1
Great tutorial.  Looking forward to playing for hours.,5
This is not the dungeon keeper I know. This is p2w crap.,1
"The in app purchases in this game are insane.  To dig out a block will take 24 hours if you do not pay.  Uninstalled.  I would rather pay $5 for a game I can actually play and enjoy than this so called ""free"" game that continuously charges you just to play.",1
"An amazing reboot of a classic franchise that blends the old school humor with new age building mechanics. The only draw back, like most free to play tablet and phone games is the pay to win aspect that most of them have. Other than that' its amazing.",4
Hhhhhh,5
"Screw micro transactions. The ORIGINAL Dungeon Keeper took under 2 minutes to build some 50 squares. Digging even a small plot now takes over 24 HOURS unless you pay to ""rush"" the projects. What an absolute scam. The originals cost $5 today (I checked). The ""best value"" micro transaction in this game is over $70!! Go pick them up and leave this micro transaction SCAM alone!",1
Good,5
I had both of these games on Win 95. Very pleased with this adaptation so far.,5
My favorite time based game.,5
Good game,4
I love this,5
I hope this game comes with more updates keep up the good work,5
Cool game. A bit different than the 1500 other strategy games out today.,5
"Microtransaction infested garbage. If you were expecting something like the old dungeon keepers have fun being dissapointed. They probably give ""gems"" to people who rate 5",1
Really fun,5
Fun time killer,5
Good way to pass time,5
Fun gameplay and good tutorial to get you up to speed.,5
Woot woot,5
"This game is pretty addictive, I like it",5
I was expecting to play Dungeon Keeper...unfortunately this is just a pay to win game! You just click and wait or click and pay. Game mechanics are not the one of Dungeon Keeper. That's a pity. Uninstalled!,1
"A bit derivative,  but that doesn't take away from the dungeon keeper vibe.",5
One of those money suckers. Try to earn every cent out of players.,1
"The game captures the fun of being a dark lord, managing their dungeon with an iron fist.",5
Even tough I just started it is super fun,5
Like the idea of being the bad guy,5
Error code 7 and they say there on it bullshit I waited 2 days if it actually works ill give it a better rating,1
Virtually everything in this game  required gems to happen at least or to make happen at a reasonable rate,1
Epic App!,5
Great game. Will pass many hours during work.,5
Fun and great to pay,5
Awesome,5
Yep,5
Its a pretty good game,5
The dark humor was pretty well thought out and the game provides some good ol√© fashion dk fun,5
I love it,5
I loved dungeon keeper back in the day. Nice to have it around again.,5
"The original was one of my favorite games, but this version is riddled with micro transactions, not fun at all.",1
Pretty cool haven't spent any money and still fun,5
Addicted,5
Its a really cool game,5
Great game,5
Its fun thus far but time base improvements and no job  queuing is a pain,4
Its good,5
This game is completely unplayable without spending real money. Just about every action requires you to pay real money to speed it up. Waste of time and money.,1
Awsome game so far. It reminds me of Diablo back in the day.,5
good time killer n very fun,5
I used to love the PC version.  Thanks for making it mobile.,5
Cool,5
Pretty cool easy to learn game.,5
Man this brings back memories. not as fun as the originals but it's a great game. I love being the bad guy sometimes,5
Not bad way to kill time,5
Awesome,5
Good game,5
I highly enjoy poop,5
More interactive Tower Defense meets Clash of Clans. Fun game but patience is required.,5
Fantastic re-imaginging of the classic. Thank you for bringing it back.,5
Amazing,5
So many memories.,5
I think this app is the best app ever and I think this app should be able to be all over the world	#google play,5
Pretty ridiculous on how much time you'll need to put into this game,5
"This game is amazing, I was looking for a clash of clans alternative, and this is way better than what I was looking for. It is kind of like Dwarves!",5
Great game,5
Love this game,5
"Too much waiting, but fun free-to-wait overall.",5
Love the look and feel of this game. A Clash of Clans or Castle Clash meets tower defense. I love both genres and this game blends the elements of both in a way I have yet to see. Awesome job.,5
Truly an amazing job. Keep it up guys :),5
Best freaking game EVAR,5
Nice pacing,5
Fun fun fun,5
Game,5
Cool can't stop playing,5
Good,5
Enough Said,5
"Didn't work period on my Kyocera rise, sucks wanted to play",1
"great game, similar to clash of clans i think",5
Great,5
Better than clash of clans,5
its a good time waster. fun dungeon defense.,5
Love this game. A lot of fun.,5
Keep it up,5
awesome,5
Thanks for your time.,5
Cool bro,5
Don't bother. The only thing this app shares with the classic game is its name. Same pointless waste of time as Clash of Clans and its clones.,1
It :),5
"Almost like the original!  Great game but why does the game have to update my status on Google circles?  Every time it tries to update, it locks up.  Very bad... uninstalled. Oh well..",2
"It is time consuming which is not bad, very fast start in ranking up,not bad, but 4 hours after tut of playing you have to wait 4 hours!!!! To remove 2 blocks thats if ur not building somting or you buy there ridiculous gems they force you to spend and buy, So heres my solution to pay to win game BUY! DELETING BUH BUY GOOD JOB EA YOUR TRASH, RUIN MORE CLASSICS, ALWAYS IN IT FOR THE MONEY!!!! PSH DONE DONT PLAY THIS GAME YOULL DELETE IT IN JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER YOU RUN OUT OF BUILDING SPACE, FREEZES CONSTAN",1
Cool,5
Realy truely epic,5
Just like the old times!!!! Never been exited to play an app but this!!!,5
Just like any other main stream publisher... EA thrives on making a quick buck.  This game is no exception.  Thank you for a waste of time. Fun game if you stole your parent's credit card.,1
"I remember when i was about 9 and i played this game on PC.  It hasnt changed to much, better graphics of course, but overall very close to original.  I really do recommend this game for fellow time wasters :-) it will not disappoint",5
Game,5
Awesome game play and layout,5
Great graphics,5
Best and bitchy,5
Classic game made simply,5
Just started very entertaining.,5
The style of play is fun but between the constant begging to be linked to my accounts and losing my progress and setting me back multiple days... Uninstalled.,1
"Yet another IP EA managed to turn into a micro transaction pay to win POS.  Not only that, but the whole theme is wrong.  DK was always monsters vs heroes.  Now heroes are gone and its monsters vs monsters?  That is dumb.",1
Like it,5
And addictive!,5
Great,5
It's an ok game,5
Worth checking out.,5
Like the game having fun figuring it out,5
I still think the PC version is better,3
Good game with a lot of different aspects to make it unique.,5
I loved this game when it originally came out.  Great port!,5
Cool,5
Its a fun game u need patients though,4
Good,5
Really fun game,5
I like this game,5
Fun addicting loved the one on pc,5
It is like the old dungeon keeper,5
I love it great game,5
Great,5
Fix bugs and I'll give 5stars,3
Pay walls everywhere. Want to dig out a small dirt block? Well you can wait 6 real hours or... Buy some gems. Want to upgrade a building.. Well wait 10 or more hours or buy some gems. This is a game that does nothing but ask for more money. Sure it gives you some gems to start off with but once those run out you need to buy more gems or wait.. And wait.. And wait to finish the most menial of tasks to finish.,1
the worst part about this game is that you HAVE to dump money into it to have any sibilance of pace. its made worse by the distraction of PVP constantly undermining you (excuse the pun) Good game and could be way more fun if you could subscribe to a casual channel (that uses ad revenue or something) to offset the need to spend real money on it for advantages...,2
Great,5
W√¥oooooooooooooooooooo,5
Loved as a.kid. Love this new one,5
"This is terrific! It reminds me of the original PC game, which I loved. It looks great on my tablet, and the gameplay is fun and witty. Thank you EA for reviving this awesome classic!",5
Best game ever,5
This is a a w e s o m e awesome game ever,5
Realy fun,5
Its like mine craft,5
"It doesn't quite have the feel of dungeon Keeper to me, perhaps because the dungeon heart acts as the portal, or perhaps because there's no goodly heroes to massacre.",4
Love it,5
Great game.,5
Dont like how you cant pick up minions and place where you want. They also dont look as cool as original designed minions. Takes a lot longer to break through walls than original. Bottom line not as cool as original game.,4
It gets really addictive,5
Great game,5
This has to be the biggest piece of crap with IAP yet.  If you lemmings want to throw away your money on it go right ahead. EA has shown me their true color already but downloaded and wanted to be sure as I loved the old version. How disappointing...,1
Cant play....code 17. Bummer,1
A little different from the old do games but nothing that is not to be expected this being another micro transaction game.,5
It is a fun throwback to the good old dungeon keeper of old. If you like that old game you will like this!,5
Dungeon Keeper!!!,5
Enjoying,5
"So far, so good",5
"I really like it. Nuff said. Kinda closes out sometimes but eh, I ain't gonna complain. Peace.",5
Fun,5
Awesome,5
An amazing and unique game!!!!,5
Super fun,5
Really good time killer,5
Fun for a mobile game,5
Fun game,5
"Gets stuck sometimes, but otherwise great.",4
You guys always make awesome games it is worth to get,5
Brilliant Game! Allonsy!,5
This would have been a great game if it weren't so full of bugs.  Constant crashing to home screen and a few hard crashes requiring removal of my battery makes this game virtually unplayable.  Lost all my game data after the first hard crash and had to start over.  Uninstalled after the second.,1
So far so good,5
New and fun,5
"One of the worst abuses of in-app purchasing I have ever seen. Go purchase the classic original on gog for a few dollars... the graphics may be dated, but it doesn't take hours to excavate...",1
This game is very fun and addicting,5
This game is to fun A must play Game -Romeo,5
Awesome!,5
"Awesome, love it. Amazing graghics fun.",5
Perfect,5
Better than clash of clans,5
Loveit,5
Very fun game to pass time,5
Way fun!,5
Fun.,5
Awesome,5
Awesome game,5
Love it!,5
Good game,5
Go download dungeon keeper two for free and save the bull ish of this freemium crap.,1
Awesome,5
Fun and sillt,4
Great,5
Could always make digging alil shorter:),5
"Love it. Unique material keeps me entertained, but too hard to get resources.",5
Best game I have on my phone. Easily,5
Great game. So addicting,5
Slow star but the concept is solid and the theme is on point,5
(:,5
Really like the demon guide.,5
Yah its fun,5
Good game,5
Addictive,5
Takes to long to do stuff for free,1
Better than the original,5
I am so far pretty pleased with this app although the need for a premium version does kinda disappoint me.,4
This game is amazingly fun  and addictive.,5
Well made and fun,5
IF YOU NEVER DOWNLOADED THIS GAME AND THINK ITS BORING OR INNAPROPRATE YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!  &gt;:D,5
Good game. Hope to see more updates,5
Just like the old pc version but on your phone,5
Very time consuming and enjoyable!,5
So much fun to play,5
"This game is atrocious. If you have ever played the original, don't bother downloading this one. EA is intent on gouging you if you would like to play this like it's predecessor.   The way this game is designed, it takes no skill, no strategy, no forethought to win. You just need money. Screw this philosophy, and all the people who have it a five star rating.",1
I have Dungeon Keeper 2 for my PC. Its great to have a version I can carry with me! I love Dungeon Keeper!!,5
Amazing,5
Unique and fun,5
I hope they make a 2nd one,5
"New type of ""city building"". Funny dialogue.",5
Fun but the original was even more fun.,5
This game is great,5
Fun,5
Gets to 90% loading minions then crashes,1
Good game for people who like games like dragonvale,5
Muah hah hah hah,5
Good game very fun,5
Liking it,5
Fun,4
Great on the John game,5
I like to play it,5
One of the best games I have come across this year,5
Very fun,5
Totally worth the download and premium content.,5
What a great time killer,5
This game takes a classic name and throws the worst of today's pay to win nonsense on top of minimal gameplay. Hopefully this trend dies soon.,1
Unplayable without spending tons of cash on in game currency.,1
"This game comes from one of the greatest old PC games to ever exist. Unfortunately, EA picked up the game and made it unplayable without the microtransactions. The tutorial literally tells you that you have to spend money to get things done. Trying to do things without feeding EA money is impossible. The game is fun, but it's agonizingly slow, so it's absolutely unplayable.",1
Great game,5
Thanks,5
But Addictive,5
Fun needs more room options and space but fun and funny commentary,5
Addictive.,5
Its a great game very time consuming,5
Enough said...,5
Totally radical,5
Too few minions and things take forever to accomplish makes for a slow slow slow game :-( but do love the game,4
Awsomeeee,5
"As a player of the old PC version, I am delighted by this game.",5
A little slow,5
Better than clash of clans,5
Awesome game,5
Awesome game,5
Sweet game,5
Love it..,5
"Fun game lets you feel evil, funny to.",5
Just as good as the original :),5
This thing is garbage.,1
Great,5
Just like I said,5
I thought they recreated the old dungeon keeper .. i was mistaken,1
(:,2
Fun but a little confusing,3
Tactically challenging.,5
"Its a great game, but EA needs to seriously lower the cost of the gems! Way too expensive for a mere phone/tablet app.",4
"While the game may have been fun in it's older iteration, this is just slow and sad.",1
I really like this game .reminds me of old world of warcraft,5
My phone handles it but it struggle at times. Besides that it a wonderful game,5
Decent reboot of Amn awesome game,5
I will give this game 5 stars when I can play it on my tablet. I have a samsung galaxy tab 3 7 inch running jelly bean 4.1.2 PLEASE fix this!!!,4
Awesome,5
"Game is good, but you'd have to spend hundreds of dollars to have a playable game. The game play even with some money spent on gems is way to slow.",1
Just like the original with a time management twist.,5
So silly.,5
I lurve this game,5
Excellent kind of like clash of clans,5
"To quote a review: A cynically motivated skeleton of a non-game, a scam that will take your cash and offer nothing in return. A perversion of a respected series, twisted by some of the most soulless, selfish, and nauseating human beings to ever blight the game industry.",1
Freezes then shuts down my phone randomly,1
What may appear to be a  free to play is covered in constant pay to play model.  Stay away.,1
Fun and addicting awesome game:)!,5
Playing this game is like taking a free ride from a friend who then drives 5 mph unless you pay him money. Then when you fall sleep he keys someone else into the car to mug you.,1
It's so great to pass the time with my new favorite game,5
I like it,5
Awesome,5
Lots of fun so far,5
"Love it so far. It's very reminiscent of the PC games I was obsessed with. The art is much ""cuter"" than it used to be. I only wish things weren't so expensive in gem and rock usage. I also would love the option of earning free gems. I understand these type of games need the waiting factor, but if it could be slightly faster, that'd be wicked.",4
Not man apps are fun these days but this one's pretty fun,5
Great,5
Fun game so far,5
Very entertaing. Reminds of clash of clans but with the old dungeon keeper theme!,5
"Another money grubbing ""pay to wait"" game. Save your money and your time.",1
Very entertaining,5
Great game,5
This game has a lot of room to grow it can just get better and better.,4
Good game,5
Great and fun game,5
‚àÜ,1
This game has an awful pay to win model.   I am not bothering,1
Loving this game,5
Its better than clash of clans,5
"Not the original, but good none the less",5
Love it.,5
A really good game but it was made my EA so what do you expect,5
Happy I found this game is so cool!,5
Its cool,4
"At first glance, this game is reminiscent of the original Bullfrog games with some updates to support mobile platforms.  Unfortunately, they were more interested in creating impediments to gameplay under the guise of a time sink, to enable the sale of ""upgrades"" in exchange for real dollars. As many have already said: I'd gladly pay a substantial amount up front for a game that more closely tracked the original, than be nickel and dimed every third time I dig a new rock, or want another imp to do my bidding",2
Just like I remember it.,5
You'll enjoy it.,5
Addicted all ready,5
AMAZING! !!!!!!!!!,5
I take what i said back! Hard rock get crashed in 4 hours? My gosh... Just a small block of it needs 4 hours. Crazy games. Spend my hours. Uninstall..,1
Everyone this is a coooooool game,5
Great game!!!,5
I would recommend this game to everybody,5
This game is a five out of five game in my books,5
"Not bad but really, really wants you to spend money on it. The two Imps you get go start will take forever to do anything, build rooms, upgrade items, etc.  A 3rd Imp is 800 gems which is an $8 purchase, while the 3rd achievement is ""buy 6 Imps"", for which you'll be rewarded with 50 gems. So the devs want you to spend upwards of $30 (the price goes up with each Imp you buy) to get a 50c reward. Riiiiight.",3
Don't support this incredibly greedy game with in app purchases! Play the original!,1
Fun. Addicting,5
Just alot of fun,5
Can't really give it a good rating if I can't play.,1
"Its a lot of fun! I just started playing it and dont see much at all wrong, I really enjoy it!",5
Coolest game no bugs on my phone love just it is a 5 star game to me,5
Kind of overwhealming at first. But its easy to learn and addictive.,5
Yes,5
üòÅ,5
Sweet,5
Its nice to play as something different then a lot of other games like this. The cool downs are not bad and the animations are great.,5
Lots of fun,5
Good stuff,5
Classic,5
Like the guy who talks to you,5
Fun way to waste time.,5
I play on the computer lots,5
Great game,5
Easy to start,5
"Fun game, I remember paying this game back in the 90s on pc, it was awesome.",5
Awesome,5
This is a great game well made,5
Great game easy to play and has fairly okay graphics,5
A Lil slow at the beginning but Big fun afterwards,5
Yup,5
This is great and totally different,5
Doesn't load on s4,1
Takes me back!!  I enjoy the game and recommend it.,5
Think Overlord dungeon defense,5
Maybe you can make a part 2,5
Requires google +. And its pay 2 play I dont have money for u ea srry but u got enough,1
Had to rate to not be bugged,5
Awesome game to kill time,5
No,5
You have to download this game,5
Good fun,5
"Connectivity and Google plus requirements annoying, then deleted my dungeon!	No offline mode, major interruptions if bus goes through a tunnel, just obnoxiously ruins a pretty fun time waster.  UPDATE: Opened it to see my imps ""show off their work"" and if reset my dungeon!! Lowered from 2 to 1 star.",1
Simple to learn and very addictive and entertainment.   Must download.,5
Played dungeon keeper 1+2 on PC for many years. This is an awesome game... Looking forward to taking over the under world ;),5
DK wrecks in battle,5
funny and entertaining,5
Good,5
Fun!,4
Can't really play it because i keeps saying tap to continue and it does not work,1
Awesomeness,5
Interesting game,5
B,5
Not worth it. Too bad because the PC game was a lot of fun,1
Awesome version of one of my all time favorites!,5
Make it faster to load and no t need to load each time it loses focus,5
Good app,5
A really cool and addictive game,5
"EA pulled the same sort of forced online / forced purchase combination as with Plants vs Zombies 2, only with barely any offline play. Would've spent $10 on a proper version but this one is getting deleted. Major disappointment.",1
Worth it,5
Excellent game,5
Pretty solid game.,5
Boss skags is what this game is. I get down hard and long  on this game!!,5
Great game like Droid game apps that more and more time to upgrade but it's the old school dungeon keeper game,5
Cool,5
I love it,5
Really addicting and fun,5
Awesome,5
Its the perfect experience if u are looking for a good time on your phone,5
Super fun,5
Yes the game is fine. But nobody in their right mind should pay these prices for in app purchases. Im to the point now that console games look attractive again. $60 for a game that you can play nonstop and not wait 24 hours for a wall to be dug out. Sorry EA. Im done with you guys.,1
to mine one block that's insane and so f@#king stupid EA and I'm going to buy dungeon keeper from gog for 5.99 and get the full game that doesn't stab me for my money. If I could give 0 stars I would!,1
Great throwback with up to date improvements.,5
I love this game,5
Awesome!,5
Pretty good,5
Cool game,5
Great game.,5
Fun and funny!,5
It's click a couple of buttons and then wait for 4 hours before I can do anything. I'd rather pay for a good game than wait hours on a crappy one.,1
Great adaptation of a classic,5
It is pretty fun.,5
Thanks,5
This classic game has been twisted into something awful. In-game purchases are required to do anything worthwhile. Uninstalling. Do yourself a favor and buy the original for $6 and remote into your computer to play it.,1
Really fun,5
This isn't a game. Its just an interactive way to lose money.,1
Take them out.,1
Funnn,5
Cool game,5
"Every time I launch a mission it has to reconnect in the middle and I loose everything, including the units I built.  And I have great connectivity.  Too frustrating to bother with.",2
Love this game its like the pc version,5
Is really fun and easy,5
Needs to connect to my google account just to play?  No thanks. Keep being terrible EA,1
Me like :-D,5
Great game!,5
This game is awesome and has been always awesome.,5
Great game to come back after ages,5
Yay,5
I love it period,5
Cant get off,5
Excellent game. Great concept. Tons of fun.,5
This game is so great,5
Good fun,5
"I would rather drop 10 bucks for the game than be constantly reminded I can be faster for gems=money. But I will hate play it because I needed a time sink. Edit: You can't hate play this game. After a day or so the cost of ""free"" materials to upgrade is so high that you can't avoid using gems. And then the PvP rewards attackers with resources that are actually lost by the defenders. If you don't buy gems you will lose your resources.  Uninstalled, and one star. EA is bad, game is bad.",1
"Microtransactions run this game into the ground. It is not only an insult to the consumer, but a pure example of how little EA actually cares about the people who buy their games. The absurd microtransactions associated with this game are an embarrassment to the industry. EA should be ashamed.",1
Interesting gameplay,5
"The original Dungeon Keeper was an amazing game for the time.  It was one of my favorite games of all time.  This version of the game is awful.  While it's ""free"" to play, in reality, you have to pay as much or more than you would for a normal PC game.  Without constantly re-upping your gems via in-app purchases, the game is practically unplayable.  It's taken all the fun out of the original.",1
I love it I really recommend it,5
About 300$/year for premium. The first additional builder costs 8$ who knows what the others cost. Cha Ching. EA turns another of my favorite franchises into a cash deposit machine for their executives.,1
It'll keep u busy for hours..great game with lots of character,5
Great game,5
Very entertaining,5
Woot!,5
Has its highs and low but Very fun,5
All around goodness,5
This is the weakest most saddening app I have downloaded I had high hopes and anticipated playing it but it crashes at 90% of the loading screen every time I try to play maybe fix and I might redownload it but where it stands its just a heap of trash that only takes up space for nothing,1
Great game to pass time,5
So far great game,5
"The only way to do anything in this game in a reasonable amount of time is to fork out money. I'm not talking a few dollars either, for a hundred you can take out 50 blocks that would normally take 24 hours a piece. Skip this game and save your time and money.",1
Great game.very fun.and very different. You just gotta download and play for yourself. U will love this game.its to hard to put down	Game is very fun and very funny and it's amazingly how you can build your own dungeon of pain it is very very great game hard to put down I recommend it to everyone,5
"...But it's a nice mobile spin off none the less. I'm still saddened that EA took over Bullfrog, destroying there amazing line of games such as DK. I'm sure they'll rune this like they do with every other game they take over.",5
I just want to play the game.  I dont want to have to sign in to play,2
Like any other city build tower defense game but with a welcomed twist. Very fun.,5
Yus,5
It fun,5
"Fun game so, havent had much time to play it yet since it wants me to rate right after the tutorial is over. I would rather there was no tutorial.  Sometimes its more fun to figure out the game for myself.",3
Do I get free stuff now?,5
Bad,5
Fun game,5
Whacky adventures,5
good,5
Lots of fun,5
All the stuff they put into it it must of been hard but it was worth it  because it is fun,5
Fun as hell,5
Very fun.,5
"This has taken the free micro-transaction game to a whole other level of mass rip-off!  The game graphics and music are outstanding, but as you'll see, it quickly becomes a game of massive frustration. Sooner or later, you'll need more gems, and gems will cost you an arm and a leg. They suggest buying 14,000 gems for $99.99 US.  Now this may sound like a lot, but in actual game play, it will only allow you to speed up digging away only 57 of the harder single plots of land. So you can pay 243 gems to knock out one of these plots, or wait 24 hrs of real time to have your minion do it.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Does anyone actually pay this kind of money?  Wow, totally nuts!!! EA, you should be ashamed of yourself. Greed is ruining this country. Don;t support this crap. Stay away from micro-transaction games.",1
Full of awful micro-transactions that make a mockery of this classic series. Don't waste a moment of your time.,1
"Loved Dungeon Keeper back in the day. While not the same as before, it is extremely entertaining. Very good.",5
"This game is so great, and all those gems for just $70! That's a great amount of gameplay, feels like they last forever (probably won't have to pay this more than 5 times EVER!), and really, $70 would only get you like, 6 or 7 copies of the prequels. Small bug on download, it's listed under free games, but I'm sure that is my phone.",5
just like the old game,5
"I really dont like tablet games. This is better than most,  but still not worth the time... and man this takes a lot of time or $",1
Looks great and reminds me the old good DK,5
Great game,5
Good game so far.,5
Epic,5
Love it,5
Addictive,5
Nice,5
Takes so long to update because I need internet but I do have internet connection but I said I don't,1
Awesome,5
The in app purchases needed to actually be able to proceed through the game make this impossible to actually play. You can wait HOURS or pay money. I can get the entire game on GOG for $5.99 with none of this garbage. EA should be ashamed of themselves. Or at least release a paid version that doesn't have the transactions in it.,1
"This game was fun for the first five minutes. Then it just froze, and won't play. It would be a five star game if I could play it.",2
"It brings back memories of the PC version, from years past.",5
Fun and addicting!,5
It is awesome for people that like building/strategy games,5
"I have only been playing for a few hours, but this game is addictive.  I can see how the micro transactions could become expensive.  There is a lot going on in this game, which makes it immersive. Drains the heck out of your battery though!",5
Great game,5
"Instead of getting a game reminiscent of dungeon keeper 1&2, this game takes micro transactions to a new level of horrible and is almost completely devoid of real time game play",1
Love it,5
I've been play this scene 2014 February 1st and its got awesome more stuff could be added and get awesomer add a dungeon finder then you can find people and face them!,5
Great fun!,5
"24 hours to mine out a single block? These people either have never played the original dungeon keeper, hate your guts, or both. Makes me want to puke.",1
I've loved this game for years. The mobile game does the franchise proud.,5
Best game,5
Cool game so far!,5
Awesome app,5
Good game,5
it restarted my whole game,1
Nice time killer,5
Tons of fun,5
Great,5
Just like clash of clans but better,5
Go buy the original game on PC instead,1
Good game & entertaining,5
Reminds me of the classic,5
I like this game it reminds me of clash of clans keep up the good work EA,5
"I mean this is good for a mobile game. It does have some elements of the classic Dungeon Keeper, I just wish EA would have done something different instead of turning it into a FTP game.",5
For a build and go game this one is worth your time,5
Good job,5
It is a fun game it just is really addictive so I would get it if I were u just don't get to addicted,4
So much fun,5
Love it,5
Love the commentary. Well done game,5
"This is a really fun game. It has an interesting twist to building your town and plundering other cities. Same basic rules apply but, being evil always that much better.",5
Very cool.,5
Cool,5
Great,5
The in app purchases are beyond a joke in this game.,1
I love a good dungeon game and this one really delivers!,5
Great game.,5
We want your money the game. Don't support EA.,1
Dam cool,5
good game. Kinda reminds me of overlord if tyats the name lol,5
Great game,5
The IAP's are so bad in this game. Seriously you can't play without buying stuff. It sucks. This game was so great back in the day. This is just sad. Shame on you EA.,1
It is so addicting. Recommended for all gamers!,5
I love the PC games! This version has awesome graphics and game play (although different) holds true to its predecessors. Giving it 5 stars for graphics and authenticity. Thank you EA for reviving Dr  :),5
Good,5
"This is a great RTS/tower defense style game. Defend your dungeon, destroy others!!!",5
Fun game,5
"Pretty cool game so far.  A nice twist on the defense genre.   Edit:  The game has since started to crash and reload, starting the game over!  Closing and restarting returns my game to where it should, only to crash again!",5
Love this game,5
Fun!!,5
Good game so far.,5
Cool,4
Cool!,5
Great,5
Brings back memories,5
"Dungeon Keeper is an awesome game... Of course, I'm talking about the Bullfrog game from the 90's. This new game is an in-app purchase- fest.  The game is unplayable without making purchases.  Do Not recommend.",1
Funny how a free game can nickel and dime you to death every time you play it. Turns out in the game app world free only means the download then they want you to pay large fees repeatedly to advance in the game. How about charge us for the game and open it up so the play experience is actually fun. Thanks for another large waste of download.,1
fun game,5
"Interesting and fun, but the time constraints are a little excessive.",4
Great way to pass time  Runs smooth and graphics are beautifully done,5
Having a great time with this version of the game!,5
Excellent game.  Alas you must have a net connection in order to play.  It makes it near useless when played on my tablet unless i'm near a hot spot.,5
Good time killer,5
Very  nostalgic for me. Capture a lot of the amusements I've had in the past.,5
not a Dickson  hdhshshdhdhshdb,5
A lot  like the original classic.   Great game.   A lot like clash of clans.,5
"Must spend money, and lots of it, to play.",1
Fun game love it,4
This game is oozing with personality. Love it.,5
Loved this game ever since I was a little kid!!!! Played back on windows 98!!!! A lot changed but is always going to be one of my favorite games all time!!,5
So far game is fun and easy to follow.  Nice twist on tower defense.,5
"Before you get on comments and make yourself sound dumb, if your phone is old or os is outdated or your phone is just having problems, first look at the majority of comments, 98% of people it is working for, these comments should b directed towards ea so they can figure out how to make thier great game work for your crappy phone, thanks for the good game, o yeah the free one as well, good job!",5
Good,5
Great game,5
Reminds me of when I plaued this for pc,5
Good!,5
Awesome graphics. Cool take on dungeon games.,5
Very fun. Excellent dungeon crawler game. Similar to clash of clans and games like it,5
Great game,5
It helps time fly by at work. While I'm slaving away so are my minions.,5
"Finally after all this time, Keeper comes to Android.",5
Had a pc game like this its great,5
"The real object of this game is to test your patience. If EA wins, they milk you for in-app purchases until your wallet bleeds. If you win, you get to endure hours of tedious, unfun gameplay that doesn't do the original Dungeon Keeper any sort of justice. In short, the only REAL way to win is not to play.  For a more authentic and modern DK experience, try War for the Overworld on Steam. It's in an unfinished, early release phase right now, and it STILL beats this ""polished"" F2P piece of crap by a mile!",1
Easy fun game to kill some.time,5
Awesome job thanks for taking the time to create a great game,5
"Dungeon still goes missing. Game restarts, gold and stone go missing. Buggy and rough, needs polish.",2
Finally something other than medieval barbarians and archers. Plus you get to be the bad guy.,5
I really like the game brings back the old days of dungeons and dragons in your moms basement,5
Really cool,5
Funny,5
Unique and deviously addicting,5
"I loved this game in its original form way back when..but in the in a world of instant gratification, waiting 4 hours for an imp to break down a block is crap, and discourages me from playing. I'd pay a dollar for 500 gems but not $5.. Make this pay for play or drop the aforementioned time/$ amounts and you'll have my $",3
Easy to learn and has lots of promise,5
This is another game that is increasing the trend of either pay to win or pay to play. Where times are extremely slow to do anything in a attempt to make you pay for more. While adults can see through it children are impatient and may make charges go up. Waiting many hours just to do one thing is not fun especially if it's just for the beginning. It's a price model that needs to stop if you want to price your work that's fine make it 4 or 5 dollars but this freemium stuff needs to stop.,1
Beats ClashOfClans any day.,5
"Good game so far, though I really dislike IAP. But then again, this was EA so what did we expect :)",4
Really fun and addictive but I wish there was a setting for seeing down to the level of the minions.,4
I love this game I recommend it to every one,5
I L.O.V.E. the old DK feel to this Clan game.   Super production values.,5
"This is a zombie of a game stitched together by EA's slave team of necromancers.   This game represents what is wrong with phone gaming today. Micro-transactions are for sub-humans, by sub-humans.  Go catch a disease and die in a fire you filth.",1
"Easy start, and fun",5
"A mere caricature of the original.  Fortunately, it's priced right.",1
Nice,5
Different feel than the old PC classic but overall a fun time killer,5
Interesting and a good time killer.,5
Love it,5
Fun time waster,5
EA ruining another great series. In app purchases ruined this game. I can't believe there are so many people that gave this steaming pile of garbage 5 stars.,1
"Runs smoothly, commentary is hilarious. Looks very good too!",5
Awesome game!,5
Like it so far. The dialogue isn't too bad either.,5
But too many iap,5
Reminds me of samurai seige which I'm digging cuz I am still hooked off that so....so far it's a plus so check it out if you are looking for a builder and something to just pass time,5
Just as much fun as when I played on my PC years ago,5
Fun game,5
"What can I say this game will steal all the time you have, and maybe some that you didn't...  in other words very addicting",5
It is a really good game,5
"Made my phone freeze, but works great on my tablet",5
Best time I have ever had on my phone.,5
L,5
Good and fun,5
EA is one of the most evil companies on the planet. The Freemium model has almost completely destroyed gaming. Dungeon Keeper was another great franchise placed on the dung pile by EA.,1
I would rate five stars but I had to restart the game two or three times. When I start it up for the first time all I see is black boxes. Fix this and ill rate five,4
Please want to give a better star rating but it keep saying 7 somthing,1
Awesome... Easily the best out there,5
"Boring, obnoxious crap.",1
Bomb digs,5
Free to play garbage full of micro transactions. It's not even a full game by itself. You have to continuously pay for the game to work like it should. Games like this are killing gaming as a whole.,1
EA destroyed this classic PC game. This game is all about paying real money to buy gems that you use to speed up your minions. EA slowed everything that your minions do so you feel forced into buying gems. I have already uninstalled this scam of a game.,1
Brings back memories from the original pc version a little hard to get use to but its a blast,5
It's good.,5
...could not connect to server.  Typical EA crap these days.,1
Fun,5
Good time waster,5
"This is a really fun free game, which is why I gave it 4-stars, but the micro transactions, and wait time are killer to what this Game is supposed to be. A RTS. 1d, and 250 gems to mine 1 block? That's a bit outrageous.",4
"24 hours to mine out some rock or pay ""gems""  to rush it. Really people? Don't you realize this is a scam.  I bet 99% of you don't realize this is a remake of a 90 game.  You really think it's OK to charge the price of a full retail game as an in app purchase!? STOP RATING THIS 5 STARS.",1
I Love This Game!,5
I like the voice over. Decent tutorial to get you started,5
Cool vame,5
Way to ruin a classic game EA.,1
fun game,5
Crappie game play that it is nothing like the original game.,1
Fun,5
I love this,5
Classic,5
Truly fun game,5
Great game!,5
Fun,5
Requires an internet connection to play. Can't play on a play or in a hotel without WiFi,1
Reminiscent of the old game. Nice that I don't have to be glued to it for hours.,5
"Helluva game, lots of fun",5
Could be a good game. I will never know as it wants to get my Google plus info.,1
"This ""game"" is handicapped by artificial mechanics that will have you paying hundreds of dollars to play it like a real game.",1
"I like this game. I've played Castle Clash and Clash of Clans, and this is my favorite so far. However, upon entering my dungeon and more recently, mid-raid, i keep getting a message that says, ""Wait while the imps get your dungeon in order"" then I'm returned to a completely unimproved dungeon. I just have to restart to get my dungeon back, but it's very frustrating having to do so. The app even froze and force closed once behind this issue. Please resolve this immediately.",4
The game force closes every couple of seconds will rate higher when fixed,1
Everyone should get this,5
"24 hours to dig out a wall, OR I can PAY to have it done instantly? Pay to win is ruining this industry, and it makes me sad just how far developers are willing to go. Games are supposed to be fun, not a grind that you can pay to bypass.",1
Good times,5
Awsom,5
Fun,5
very good,5
Really gives me hope to find a game to keep my attention like this does!,5
Took a good game from way back and made it an annoying pay-to-play.  Do people actually spend $20+ in a game???,1
Evil        Fun,5
GadrielRamirez,5
Can't play offline,1
A retro update.,5
Pretty awesome. Nothing to complain about!,5
Great game. Doesnt try and force you to spend real money all that much,5
Very fun,5
Pootis,5
Same here managed to play up to placing first trap then it crashed and I keep getting error code 7 how do u fix that?,1
"Good game, same as everything else. For free takes a long time. Gems are rare.",4
Nice twist on a common game,5
In app purchases ruined this game. It was my favorite back in the day. Don't bother with this rip off,1
It was fun,5
Lot of fun,5
I loved this game on the PC.  So glad I get to play it again!,5
This game is back!!!,5
It helps pass time but fun,5
Miss this game on the PC! Was excited to see it become an app,5
Its a little complicated at first but becomes easy and addicting.,5
Very nice game to play,5
"This isn't even a game, unless waiting is your idea of fun.  Don't waste your money in the store.  Don't even start playing this shameless money grab.",1
It's just the same old tired mobile game... It's all in-game purchase drivin. This is why mobile gaming will never replace console or PC gaming.,1
SWEET DOG,5
Good graphic,5
Pretty sweet little game,5
"I in joy seeing an old game coming back, and its nice to see that its free two. So far its seems to be an good and well balanced game the only problem I in countered was after the tutorial the touch mechanics of the game went haywire but after reloading the app everything worked fine. I would recommend playing this game and look for the original PC game.",5
Love it so far,5
Cleverly addicting,5
Unless your willing to drop gems (money) this game will take forever! EA is clearly using an old and loved title to scam people,1
Fun,4
"Loaded with in app purchase crap. No confirm spend for the ""premium"" currancy. AVOID.",1
"Top pick game? More like top uninstall game, don't even waste your time. Would have paid for the original version straight up. Game is completely handicapped by micro transactions and virtually unplayable. I do not recommend.",1
Exellent,5
Would not load,1
Moop,5
Liking the new feel.... Wish it was like the og however,5
Great game fun n addictive,5
"Easily one of, if not the best game I have played on a mobile phone.",5
Awesome,5
Classic Dungeon Keeperish!,5
Awesome,5
"Mega company EA milks an old franchise, spits on fans by not making a proper game, copies low budget mobile games, adds nothing original, then throws out the standard, absurd pricing structure with a healthy pay to win element. Tap and wait, so goes the joke in another of their titles.  I don't know who to be more ashamed of, EA or everyone making this ridiculous system financially viable enough to choke mobile gaming with copy-paste garbage.",1
Very nice game its the best game i think so,5
"This game would be fun if things were balanced so that you could play for a while each day, instead of forcing you to set things in motion and come back every few hours for a few minutes...  Or buy gems at exorbitant rates.  7 days of premium time, which boosts all your resource collection, is over $7!  100 Days is $100!  That's just ridiculous.  It's also extremely pay-to-win, with the ability to buy bonuses to offense and defense, and you can even buy a 'cave in' which prevents anyone from attacking your dungeon.  In the end, it means the game isn't fun unless you're spending dozens of dollars per day.  It's an absolute travesty.",1
Really fun,5
Quick learning curve. I am just done with all these types of games that you have to spend money just to get better stuff in them. But it is fun and the voice over is cool,5
The app's really fun if you like to conquer things. (:,5
Its great,5
Its a wonderful mix of good old DK game play with the now necessary microtransaction needed to survive.,5
Love it!!! üòÄüòÄüòÄ,5
I'll have Jordan Concords,5
I saw this game on computers but now phones,5
Great game so far...keep up the great work.,5
Awesome!,5
It's OK to pay 5 bucks or so to get the full game. But the wait time and cost of this makes this free to play a scam. Get real people. Stop rating these games so high and STOP PAYING THIS MUCH for crap,1
"I was glad to see this game again, I played the original one back in the day, this is a good version of it thanks guys",5
U can build you own dungeon and go in battles to save your dungeon!,5
Enjoyable twist on standard builder.,5
"Very, very addictive. Absolutely fun and challenging.",5
"And I just started, this game puts an awesome new spin on old kingdom games",5
Fun and really easy to control,5
Cannot connect to server,1
Better than clash of clans more interactivity and cool graphics,5
A nice game,5
Absolutely amazing and I've only had the game for an hour. I'm sold!,5
Its a fun game with a ton of things to do. Great game guys!,5
Very good,5
Great game,5
Extremely fun should be sleeping but can't stop playing,5
I played this when I a kid and loved it same now lol :-),5
Sweet game.,5
Very nice.,5
Somewhat similar to clash of clans but funnier,5
Very good,5
I loved the original and so far Im really into this version. Good job,5
Nice adaptation to the good old days,5
This game very fun and interesting,5
"Those who played DK 1 and 2 should definitely get it... Ofc not as good as the game but is definitely made as close as possible and is a lot of fun. Also game fans, 3rd dungeon keeper is being created, ""war for the over world"", look it up if you like dungeon keeper.",5
Addictive and fun,5
K well this game sucks bc it keep saying code 7 so until u fix it ill make sure all my friends know not to play this game so fix it,1
I love this game it is so fun being bad,5
Very enjoyable. Brings back old dk memories,5
Expect to uninstall within 5 minutes of game play.  EA absolutely destroyed what used to be an awesome game with micro-transactions.  It's beyond comical that people are willing to pay their way to victory in addition to giving this game a much undeserved 4.7.  The same could be said for a huge majority of the games on the Play Store.,1
Gold,4
This is a great game just really fun no problems that I've found really a great game,5
Wow awsome,5
This is a free-to-play cashgrab that takes a giant greasy dump on the spirit of a great IP.  How could anyone be proud of working on this?,1
IAPs are ruining games.,1
Can't stop playing!,5
Always loved this game...thank you,5
"It's another EA pay-to-win app that wants access to all your Google contacts, even the ones that aren't in circles, when it isn't constantly reconnecting and locking up. Way to run a classic franchise into the toilet.",1
I enjoy waiting for hours to break one block. - said no one,1
Cool,5
Amazing game brings back memories,5
Its a must play,5
This game is boombastic,5
Game,4
Good game,5
Very fun,5
"Fun to see a different version of Dungeon Keeper even if it is like most ""Facebook"" style of games.",5
Best game of its genere,5
So far,4
"Unless you are prepared to spend FAR more than you would on any regular game purchase or subscription, do not expect this to be fun. Google ""baekdal dungeon keeper"" for a good explanation.  When it says ""get more out of"" this by linking it with your Google ID, what it means is you can't play unless you do. Social engineering much?  Tried to give it a fair chance, but between the pressure to spend (and buy) gems, the constant ""code 7"" disconnects, and two lockups requiring battery pulls, it's gone for good.",1
Good,5
If you have ever played Dungeon Keeper on the computer then you will enjoy this mobile version! :) It brings back memories of the fun times I had with the other games.,5
Controls are touchy.,5
Loved playing Dungeon Keeper when I was younger on pc but now I can enjoy it on my phone!,5
This is a good replacement to clash of clans. Imo anyway?! Try it a lil different from the usually rts ay style,5
Brings back great memory and fun for a pay 2 win game,5
Heck yeah I loved these games bavk when I was a kid an they finaly brought em back,5
Nice game to pass time with,5
"This meets nearly all of your mobile gaming needs. Its fun, quirky, and quick. Like most high production games today, on the mobile market, it takes a while to load and perform complex actions, save for the most advanced android devices.",5
Some diffs but change can be good sometimes,5
No issues. Run of the mill with good humor. Classic franchise with classic feel. Well done,5
Awesome Game Is Awesome,5
Brings back good memories of the original!,4
Awesome and fun,5
Super fun game so far,5
Chicken squishing at it's finest.,5
this is the first game that im really injoying out of any other game iv downlaoded,5
Dungeon keeper is the best beat your friend up game,4
Cool,5
Its fun,5
Ridiculously expensive free game.  Just ruining one of the best games from the 90s with their micro transactions.,1
Pretty fun,5
Fun and creative,5
Bad money drain,1
Great game!,5
"EA should be ashamed of themselves. No one should download this ""free"" game. This is greed in action.",1
Loved it on pc and love it more that they brought it back,5
"EA has updated the tower defense game, Dungeon Keeper, and made it into a Clash of Clans free-to-play clone. While some may decry EA for despoiling a gaming classic others will welcome another entry into the highly competitive tower defense genre that have made CoC and its ilk the top downloaded games on mobile devices. You don't ever have to pay for anything in the game to progress, but the trade off is considerable waiting times to build out and staff your dungeon. Again, this is nothing new for CoC veterans, who probably will try it out so that they can play another similarly-styled game in between content upgrades.",5
Great,5
Excellent,5
love game,5
This game is so devilishly fun,5
Enjoyable fast paced,5
Cool.,5
A fun game and very addictive,5
Finally a rival for Clash Of Clans! Hope this game spreads fast.,5
Loved this game when I was a kid,5
Just an overall time killer. Very captivating,5
Great,5
Great,5
"So far so good, if it maintains I will give it 5 stars",4
Original game was brilliant. This has some aspects of the humor and fun. But the pay to play model mapped on top of this feels wrong. Having to wait days to play your dungeon kills all the fun for me. I would play the original for hours at a stretch.  This is meant to be played 5 mins at a time every couple hours.,3
"Its more complex than Clash of clans, but still keeps the fun!",5
"This is nuts, too much pay me pay me now, gaming used to be fun, not pay me to make the game playable!",1
!!!!!!! Legend,5
I can't put it down,5
Fun :P,5
Love DK when it first came out and this app has taken DK to the next lvl,5
Game has well done graphics and animation work over all. Gameplay is smooth. Fun and creative.,5
Good game,5
Very fun very addicting,5
Good,5
Fun,5
Awsome,5
I haven't slapped an imp in years and it feels so good to get back into the game that I wasted so many hours on years ago. I feel a re-addiction coming on!,5
Fun to play,5
Just so close to what I remeber,5
Fun app.,5
Really fun!,5
Played this game on computer before. Cool to see it on mobile,5
Ones u start u dont wanna stop,5
This game is driving me mad but it's a pretty good game,5
It's a game you play and its good.,5
Goog,5
One of my favorite old games redone with even more awesome.,5
One of my new favs...EA keep'em coming,5
Very cool game just wish gems where easier to obtain!!,5
Ive played with mythic before ea took it over so im happy to see it is still around,5
Good stuff,5
Fun game its like clash of clans with a twist,5
Great,5
Love playing builder games,5
Solid title,5
Dope,5
I played the first series on PC and absolutely loved it and now that it is on my Android I am ecstatic about it and can't wait to see what the developers have for me!!!!,5
Awesome fun,5
Fun,5
Aaaaaa,5
Really fun game. :),5
Not bad,5
Just fix it,1
Pretty kuhl,5
"Good game , seems easy, weak internet connection though",5
"Looks like im gonna be hooked, just like im hooked on the pc version.",5
"Pay to win big time. Much worst here than in other games. Bonuses to damage, bonuses to loot, bonuses to everything you can imagine as long as you pay. Sucks that this is the state mobile gaming has gotten to.",1
Fun,4
Pay-as-you-go with no offline mode. Crap like this is ruining mobile gaming.,1
Fun,5
It takes an entire day to dig out one tiny block of land? Microtransactions are beyond reason.,1
"Fun, well crafted,",4
Great time killer,5
"Was really excited to play the game. Before realizing it was a ""free to play"" game. Takes 4 hours to go through one block or you can pay. Major disappointment...",1
Can't stop playing. Game is packed full of humorous puns,5
Fh,5
"To speed up wait times you need crystals, eventually. To get more crystals, if you don't want to wait or lose your army to get more crystals by beating missions. Is to buy them. Eventually you'll need to buy them... And only after a few lvls.",2
Fun to play,5
Addictive,5
Been wait  years for  this,5
Really great game. Just like its computer predecessor,5
Yep,5
This game makes me so happy. I love all the DK games!,5
In game purchasing ruined this entire game. What a disgrace,1
This game is basically impossible without spending a lot of money to buy more gems.,1
So fun,5
Love playing this game when it first came out!,5
Great,5
"Good graphics, doesn't reach instantly for your wallet.",5
Fun game.,5
Plays like a dream on my nook HD+!,5
"Takes a bit to learn, but thats a good thing.",5
Fun so far kinda odd it asks to rate 10 minutes into the game oh well,5
Its pretty cool,5
Fun,5
I loved this game on the computer and now I have it on my phone!!  Not the exact same but it's close enough for me. :),5
When i got this i thought. It was going to suck but now that i have played it MORE i need more feachers more more more!!!!!. `sometimes its good to be bad` ~NegaJack~,5
"Except often having to reload, (+Battery drainer) but otherwise great game",5
This game is addicting :),5
Fun,5
"Probably one of the best games on the market. Even though paying is an option you get the full experience already just sticking to the free factors. The detail to the environments, characters, actual voices. It's freaking amazing!!",5
Gm,5
Good,5
MonKey likes games of manipulation. Like Chess and Overlord.,5
"Update: lowered to one star. There is nothing redeemable about this ""game""  bullfrog the original creator of dungeon keeper made a fun unique game  Imp's make your dungeon, you get 2 to start. After that they cost real money.  To do anything you need Imps.  Everything takes ages to do so the game play is:  log in. check time left for each imp.  Click to do next task if an imp finished a task. log out for that day. Repeat.  Sounds like fun! I'd pay $20 for a functional version... Not interested in extortion.",1
Dungeon keeper Is a great game highle recamend it,5
Fun game,5
If you don't want to be constantly needing to use gems to keep the game up to pace and spending much more money than the game is even worth then this game is not for you.,1
Most fun I've had in a while,5
Not bad,5
"Bad Mythic! Bad! You don't need access to my system settings for a game and you shouldn't even want all of those  network permissions. I'm already being data mined enough, thanks.",1
Awsome,5
Great game,5
Good game annoying on how you have to wait to claim more mines,5
"They turned a PC game into a time based game for mobile, very much like clan wars. The gameplay is almost an exact match but the theme is better, so I choose this one.",5
Awesome,5
"Fun, inventive",5
Cool,5
Been looking for this game for a long time!!,5
Fun game,5
Love this game,5
Fun,5
Awesome,5
Loved this game as a kid and was so happy to see it back!!!,5
Like,5
Fun,5
I was looking for a good game to play I think i found it gotta tell me friends,5
Game is reminiscent of the old dk2.   Fun but at times need to wait too long for various things.   But what do you want for the price of free.,5
good game,5
Yay!,5
Cool,5
Super fun addicting,5
Campaign and achievements make game fun offline,5
He he he he it's fun,5
A fun build and expand game with a dark twist love it!!!,5
Pinche juego esta chingo,5
Yes,5
Can't wait to see what more you do with this,5
Come on people. These micro transaction laden games are ridiculous. They took dungeon keeper 2 and wrecked it. And sim city.  I just loathe EA.,1
Really fun,5
"This game is really good, still have to learn how to play though",5
U all need to fix error code 7 ..... fix it fix it fix it i loved the game back in the day,1
Great game,5
this game has amazing potential. Guild potential is amazing but please for the love of God make an open world chat! I cannot find an active guild at all! Please I will run the entire underworld just let us communicate!,2
Awesome,5
Nice,5
If you are looking for something fun and to pass the time this is your game.,5
Just like the pc one,5
I can't even install it it keeps giving me the error code,1
Quite entertaining,5
"Pay to win, but a great tablet setup. If updates are maintained, this could be one of the best dungeon raiding games for mobile",5
"Pretty funny, but that doesn't redeem the mechanics.",1
This is one of my favorite games from back in the day! The computer version was a cult classic! This game lives up to the original! Instant favorite. If you loved the first DK you will feel right at home,5
"Great games, does bullfrog proud. Hugely recommended to DK fans",5
Microtransactions ruined it,1
Sweet,5
Great game,5
Keep getting error 7,1
Great game,5
Fun like clach of clans,5
Please make it not so easy to make the imp s accidently start digging. It sucks when they're digging for 24 hrs when you didn't want them to,4
Really fun,5
The game gets interrupted when the internet isn't available. Not helpful for a tablet user. Uninstalled.,1
I've been waiting for a new Dungeon Keeper (Mobile or PC) for a long time.,5
Wonderful homage to the original. Worth the download.,5
Still waiting to get bored of it.,5
Great game,5
Nice and fun lol keeps me interested,5
Brings back memories.,5
Fun theming,5
"Miss this game as kid. Glad to see it back, with some interesting changes.",5
Pretty good so far,5
"I used to play this on the PC years ago, loved it then, and am gonna love it now.",5
"The original was great! This has such promise, but it tries to mine your wallet so fast and hard right after the tutorial you feel like crying in the rape shower. Seriously EA, for shame! At least Candy Crush sweet talks me first and doesn't make me wait FOREVER for some gratification. (Mining one square takes a day!?! Really?) Oh how I long for the days of paying for a game upfront. Lame. Uninstalling.",1
Really enjoying it. Makes me remember playing it back in the day.,5
What happened you turned this game into the the average  no brainer bf skinner game take it back to the pc and give us first person control like DK gold.,2
Great remake,4
"Would prefer a one  time fee, and be able to enjoy a experience. This is click and wait.  If you don't pay,  then the players who do will destroy you, making it pointless.  Save your money and buy a whole game or 10.",2
Basically makes you pay by making you wait 24 hours for diving out 1 wtf,1
I played the PC game years ago and loved it then. Sale DK without the gem I would pay the price.,5
"Its a good game so far, getting thru the tutorial is a little long",4
EA why does your games always have connection probelms.I started the game  and after three minutes the code 7 thingy popped out.,2
Offline,1
This used to be one of my all time favorite games on the PC. I was so excited to see it on Android. However that lasted just through the tutorial. The amount of money you have to spend on gems for even the most basic task is OBSCENE. Talk about corporate greed. I feel sad for all those who are actually paying for this crap.,1
This game is awesome luv graphics luv gameplay recommended for any fun gamer,5
Excellent game,5
Awesome,5
I cannot get past the start  itll freeze and reset my phone  i wanted to love this game,1
Great spin on an old favorite!,5
Im so bad im good,5
Very fun,5
Good,5
"For an Android App, it's a pretty entertaining rendition of Bullfrogs classic.",5
Simply a money grab by EA. Go find the pc version and enjoy.,1
Great game give it a try,5
Great game,5
Great and witty game with mischievous humor,5
nice game,5
"Most of the five star reviews are because players were bribed with in game bonuses. The game is designed to make in app purchases required to progress at any reasonable speed. This is not the Dungeon Keeper you remember, it is just a tool to leverage the Dungeon Keeper name to sell gems in game.",3
Just started this game. Very impressive. ...Thanks EA.,5
Very close to the dk I already fell in love with on pc and dos,5
Very well done,5
Fun,5
Great game,5
"In my opinion, this is way better than clash of clans!!! Everything about this game is amazing i just wish the wait times were a little shorter. Also the game could use more slapping because slapping those imps is halarious xD",5
i realy liked it,5
I love this game on the p_c on the phone it's not as good but still fun,5
A must try,5
This game is awesome.,5
Fun!,5
I cant even play it wont let me even move the camera,1
The nostalgia alone is worth it.,5
Great game so far,5
In an awesome way! It's a pretty faithful to make of the original. Fun and a good way to wile away time on a bus or in a car.,5
I liked the original and this one brings back a lot of memories,5
I miss dungeon games and now tht i have one im glad,5
"I was a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, so I looked forward to this. Unfortunately I can't play it. I get a server error 17. I haven't any idea what this means and no desire to debug it. Uninstalling until EA can provide something that actually works.",1
But underground,1
Great,5
Highly addicting,5
I like the random speech.,5
Loved this game back on the computer and still love it on my phone,5
Enjoying the game so far.,5
fun,5
This is the most horrible micro transaction game I've ever played.  And the game play is pretty dumb to boot.   Can we get a proper Dungeon Keeper reboot?,1
Fun for hours of play or just little bits of time,5
Awesome game,5
Fun stuff,5
Accept there should be a place for you to download the rap in game accidently clicked never and now can't get it also everything is to expensive for suck low levels should balance it more,4
cool,5
"I was very excited for this game as the original was so much fun. The only problem is that it isn't a game. It is little more than a thinly veiled scam. To do anything in the game you have to wait inordinate amounts of time unless you're prepared to micro transaction all day. You can even dig out the whole map for $100. The amount of IAPs is just insane. IAPs period, but I can see them being used to accelerate the game. However you can't even play this game without spending money.",1
Awesome,5
Loving the game. Played tbd original years ago.,5
Love making traps,5
Lots of fun,5
Amazing,5
"This was a fun game at the beginning,  but once you run out of gems good luck. I can't believe the sheer greed of companies these days. They expect us to pay $100 for a stack of gems to continue playing when the game is not even worth half that. Big Dissapointment!",1
Good but not perfect,4
Love it,5
Super fun,5
No comment,5
"So far it's fun! I also like the comments, I find myself chuckling",5
"I can't even remember the amount of time I've spent wandering the dungeons of Dungeon Keeper 2...  I wrote EA many moons ago asking (begging) if they were going to come out with another Dungeon Keeper after they bought Bullfrog and cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3 in March of 2000 -- My face literally lit-up when I saw this.  True to the game of old, Horny is back and the game looks stunning!  ""One of your imps does a great impression of you. He can even do the ears.""",5
I remember playing the original Dungeon Keeper game and enjoyed the pace. Now in order to play the same game requires massive amounts of time to accomplish what took minutes!  And the solution for this? In app purchase to speed things up. Unacceptable game design and I won't have this game on my Android any longer.,1
Good game,1
Cool game,5
Great game,5
Fun and exciting game,5
:),5
Great,5
Fun game!,5
Love it so far,5
Good,5
Ruining SimCity must not have been enough...,1
Brings back years gone by of dnd paper and pen sessions.,5
To bad it's a pay as you play game,5
awesome,5
Was great now very poor,1
Sweet,5
Great game!,5
Not bad! Something diff,5
awesome,5
Fun twist on dungeon games,5
It's like clash of clans,5
Great game,5
"EA took an amazing, beloved Bullfrog game and spat all over it. It barely represents what the game used to be, and is a thinly veiled attempt to suck your wallet dry.",1
"Still cannot beat Clash Of Clans,",4
Fun game,5
Great game,5
Fun game.,5
Fun,5
"New at this sort of thing,  but so far it's been fun.",5
I loved this game when it came out more than 15 years ago. I hope this brings all those good times back.,5
"The original is still much better than this version and it was made 15+ years ago, ea bought the rights to this game and ruined it imho.",1
Good to pass the time,5
Yee Yee,5
Really fun. I'm hooked,5
Very much like the PC version I played endlessly! I call this an excellent game!,5
This is awful.  Anyone who knows what this game truly is must vomit at the horrendous money mine EA turned this into.  This must stop.,1
I lovethis game a lot its really cool,5
Good game.,5
Lots of imp slapping fun!,5
Great game to pass the time,5
Nice,5
"So far this reminds me of the old dungeon keeper game.  I'm not a big fan of the 'every action=waiting' to get you to spend money, but so far this is fun.  My guess is I will soon get tired of all the waiting around and stop playing.",5
Other than that I really enjoyed this,5
"Up on playing for couple of hours my opinion about this game has changed dramatically. The game is unplayable without spending cash to buy gems. It isn't an incentive to buy the gems, it is unplayable without them, often putting on hours long, sometimes an entire day of wait to complete an action. That's not slowing the game down, that's stopping it for a day. Couple that with their ""best value"" gem purchase option being $90+, this game is too much of a blatant cash grab for my liking. Uninstalling.",2
A bit expensive but still great!,5
I love this game finally tha game I've been f+@$in waitin for,5
Great game!,5
Great game,5
This game is really fun ‚ô•,5
Great game and addicting,5
Love it!,5
Fun,5
Best game ive played in a while and its funny and full of houmor,5
Fun,5
Just like old times,5
Love the game. Super fun and quite addicting. Definitely gonna keep me busy!,5
Great concept. Fluid play.,5
Fun game,5
Micro transactions are killing gaming on phones.,1
Sad turned what was once a good game into junk. Dont bother to play just yet another old game memory destroyed by a bad phone app	This game stinks now. Uses the old DK theme to try and make a quick buck.,1
Very good game,5
Veary good game a little different then the original one but still good,5
Pretty fun. A classic game type executed masterfully.,5
Good,5
Better than original,5
Good game spent lots of time,5
"From the first few minutes on, this game goes out of its way to exploit users out if privacy and money.",1
Awesome,5
Great,5
Addicted like it,5
Best game ever,5
Sweet game. Very polished and professional.,5
A nice pace change from clash of clans. Also remember when this originally was out for pc,5
"Long term style of old dk, just what it needed",5
Still a good game to pass the time,5
Hope they improve game it on single core  like the samsung 4.2 galaxy player 2.3 andriod this would be super. Thank you not many people have dual core with lots of ram my is 1gig  cpu single core and 486 ram please improve smooth game play love the game.,5
Would love a fix to be able to play,1
Seems fun,5
I love it finally they bring it to a nap I've played this in a million times on the computer so now I can play on my phone,5
Excellent so far,5
It could have more blood and gore but other than that its awesome,5
Good stuff,5
I remember playing DK2 back in the day. This is a fun time waster while keeping true to the original games,5
Thanks,5
"they make you either pay or wait dumb amounts of time to break blocks. It's nothing like the original, and disgraces it completely. I hate all the in-app purchases so much I uninstalled. If you are going to make me pay to enjoy the game then just make me pay $5 up front and not have any in-app purchases, I did the math and its about 110 dollars to actively break 60 gem blocks and EA is a terrible company for that. It was not enjoyable, get the original for computer and you will be happy.",1
Ku,5
Yay,5
Fun game.  Reminds me of the old school game.  Need some mistresses to slap around.,5
Love it,5
Great Game!,5
Fun to play!,5
Pretty good. Like the voice of the demon.,4
He original DK games were amazingly fun and addicting. This update of the series captures that perfectly and is hands down one of the best mobile games I've played. DK and Clash of Clans have robbed me of countless hours of my life haha.,5
Fun game,5
"Yes! At last! It isn't Dungeon Keeper 3, but it plays great for what it is.",5
Excellent,5
Enjoying the game loads,5
Fun game!,5
"I have been waiting for a game like this! I don't have time to play games lately, and with this game, I don't need time. I can pay real money and win without playing! I wish all games had this option! When I am not winning I just pay more money than my opponent, and I win! I would much rather pay real money repeatedly than play a game and possibly lose. Why play when you can pay? I couldn't win games without microtransactions. They are the answer to every lazy gamer's prayers! Welcome to the future!",1
How dare you try to gouge players of such a obscene amount of money. Shame on you,1
Excellent just needs less time,5
I keep getting disconnected from my server frequently other than that it's a pretty awsome game,4
Really fun game and great  graphics can't wait to upgrade and grow strong,5
I was really expecting better. Looks like just another crappy village/town style game. I would pay good money to have a very close replica of dk2 on my mobile device.,1
AWESOME,5
Great but laggy,4
Great reboot,5
Just started and I like how you can get going very fast. The developers should add more room and allow hard gem vains to be broken much faster than an entire day,4
I'm still learning...,4
Nothing but in app purchases that last for a short time. Basically the downfall of the gaming world... Thanks EA for doing what you to make the gaming community a little worse everyday.,1
The dialog is fun as you go through the game. And Slapping your imps... Nuf said.,5
Awesome,5
"I was a huge fan of the originals on pc. This is a good translation but could stand a few tweaks. Biggest complaint is that this is more of a time based game than the originals. I dont want to wait 4 hours to tear down one earth tile. It was more fun starting from scratch every level. I would be more then happy paying $5-$7 on this ""lite version"". I know free to play profit margins dont allow for this but I dont see why ppl would make iap's on something that gets old quickly. Other then that I love this!",5
Loved this game back in the day still love it mobile.,5
Not how i remberd the game but still quite fun.,5
Addictive,5
Is a fun game,5
"A must have. Was worried that it was like any other castle defense game. It's not. Get it, you won't regret it. Awesome. Totally awesome.",5
Good game,5
Is legit,5
Awesome game!,5
"It's really really fun. Good graphics, too.",5
Quality product from EA as always.,5
A very nice spin on a classic!,5
Cool game,5
"Brings back lots of memories.  It is for the free to play model, so doing just about anything takes time or purchased gems,  such as upgrading a room can be 30 mins. You can earn some gems by completing achievements. You also do not need to just wait around for resources to gather as you can get them by raiding in the solo campaign.  Pretty fun so far.",4
"Great game, never played this before and I'm hooked!!!",5
BONER,5
"EA once again took successful attempt of assasination of great franchise. I would still be willing to buy this game but that's not what EA want, they want to keep their greedy hands inside of my wallet forever. 4 hours for imp to dig one square or instant if you pay. Game is hardly playable, rather you turn it on for 2 min to click few things and that's all, wait for somebody who spent theirs mom's paycheck to raid you.",2
Fun game,5
A blast from the past. Brought a smile to my face!,5
It is a great game,5
I have a feeling that I'm not getting anything accomplished for a while. If you need me I'll be in my my dungeon.,5
"Awesome effects, and design. Loving it!",5
Very fun,5
Its awesome. I love slapping the minions. :D,5
Played until I had to go and plug my phone in Samsung galaxy Mega!,5
Fun game,5
Fun game!,5
So basically this is clash of clans with a few DK elements and too many micro transactions. I would have loved a good port of DK2 and not a game that only resembles Dungeon Keeper.,2
I use to play this on pc and its great to see it remade like this I really enjoying it so far can't wait to see what other imprivments you do.,5
Excellent,5
Fun in OCD form,5
A classic returns.,5
"I was a good guy at first. I had friends and I talked to my family. Then came along Dungeon Keeper, now I don't see my family and all my friends say I've become a little sadistic and even my parents are starting to become worried. I've lost track of time on numerous accounts and the games beginning to consume me. Overall its okay.",5
Awesome graphics,5
"When I saw this game on the play store I almost had a heart attack. Dungeon keeper. One of my favorite games here in the palm of my hand. I was so happy. That was short lived though as five minutes into the game, I was reminded that all that glimmers is not gold. Twenty four hours to dig one plot of land. Oh but there were gems that you could use to speed up the process. But after you spent the ones you had? You have to buy more. YOU COULD BUY THE ORIGINAL GAME WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY. I MEAN MY GOD.",1
Brings back memories,5
Just almost like the classic great,5
My second favorite game,5
I wish EA didn't try to make so much on all their games.  This is one of my all time favorite games.,5
Pretty fun!,5
This game reminds me of Dungeons so much. It is awesome to think that I have that game play again,5
Better than I expected,5
"The tutorials drag on but, it is really fun.",5
I used to love this game for PC. Seems pretty cool.,5
"Awesome, nothing more... Nothing less",5
One of my all-time favorites returns from the grave like  hungry vampire!,5
Good,5
Awesomeness,5
Awesome but gets boring,5
nice,5
Love this game played it as a child kinda wish it was like the older game instead of a money maker,5
It would be better if you could just buy it.,1
Its interesting so far,4
"It's pay or wait forever, to get  one tile of space you wait a day or pay 249 gems which is equal to 2.50 dollars this is for 1 tile just don't get this game.",1
The original DK was a well thought out strategic game.  This is a bad clash clone.  The first hour of the original game would provide you with a thought out dungeon and fun experience.  To get even half of that dungeon experience would take over a week in this game unless you want to spend $100.  There are litterally hundreds of games that are a better use of your time and money.,1
Interesting idea. & awesome gameplay. Can get really addicting. If u ever liked dungeon crawl games you will definitely like this!,5
Just say no...,1
Funtimes,5
Fun funny quirky,4
Games with Micro-transactions aren't fun. This one is just over the top.,1
It be it!,5
Awesome,5
"It has in app purchases, but its pretty good.",4
FIIIIX IIITTT,3
"Brings back good memories of DK. It's a little different obviously,  but a lot of fun!",5
Loved this game when it was on pc... love the fact that I can play it in my phone!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Happy,5
A great game to get into,5
Awesome!,5
Grrrreat,5
I remember watching my mom play it when I was a child... now I get to play it.   VERY ADDICTING!!!!!,5
"Think Clash of Clans but Dungeon Keeper. Though it occurs to me some of you may not have been around for Dungeon Keeper... anyways, download this!",5
Awesome,5
COOL,5
"If I attack someone I loose my beginners protection. Why the hell am I being attacked? Same with all the other games like this. If you start later than others and you don't spend cash, its a waste of time.",1
Not as good as a full version but still addictive and fun to play,4
Great,5
Micro transactions. Killing gaming.,1
Love this game get it,5
Its just really awesome,5
Reminds me of the old pc version I used to play.,5
Buy Dungeon Keeper 1 and don't bother.,1
"Love this game, isn't pushy about paying",5
Mucho enjoyable! Lots of wonderful time wasting.,5
Just wow. IAP hell. I feel so bad for this title.,1
It's fun,5
A game that lets you play in a way that is unique and I love it,5
Sauce,5
"Excellent Game... similar to clash of clans, but better",5
H,5
It is cool,5
Micro transactions have ruined the mobile gaming industry.,1
Waiting,1
Reminds me of the old pc version with a twist,5
Loads of fun for the whole family,5
Could use a better system for connecting though,5
Very fun game for some RTS type play.,5
"Great graphics and sound and gameplay.  IAP ruins all the good work done by the dev and art teams.  If there was a no IAP version that let me play the game instead of trying to decide how much actual money I'd like to spend clearing a square, I would be interested.  Also, the game uses an unreasonable amount of battery when left running in the background.",1
Practice of your body to be done it without me,5
Fun-tastic!,5
I loved the the old dungeon keeper games and this is an awesome addition to the line up. I just find that it is to easy to move your rooms. Quite often when I am simply moving over a room it thinks I want to move it. Maybe make it an option when selecting the room instead of touching and holding over a room.,5
Great Game,5
"Oh, nostalgia, you have bested me here.",5
Fun so far,5
This is fudgen awesome,5
Like these types of games. very good time wasters,5
Ode to the Original with a modern twist!,5
Hhh,5
Like a fall day,5
"I was pretty excited when I saw the Dungeon Keeper app, since the originals were some of my favorites. It was a little disappointing to find out it was more of a Clash of Clans ripoff than a Dungeon Keeper game.  Having said that, it's a fairly fun Clash of Clans ripoff.",3
So glad this classic game is back...thanks EA,5
Pay to Play.  At all.,1
Awesome,5
"Awesome throwback to the original classic, with a lot of changes that will make it appeal to a whole new audience.",5
A beautiful style of strategy. When update s lunch this game will be all the more better,5
"Whenever you feel like joining the dark side, this is a must.",5
New fun,4
Skippy,5
Great . Just ease up on buying gems.,5
The original game was a lot of fun. The aggressive IAP price gouging takes away from what used to be a great game.,1
"Great gave, keep up the devil talks lol",5
Much better than their competitors games!,5
Awesomeness,5
Its alive¬°!!!!!!!¬°!!!!!!!@!!,5
A good adaptation of an old favorite.,5
"Fun game, really good polish and finish. Voice is nice. Note 3",5
Fun so far.. Gems are too hard to get,5
K,5
Epic,5
Like it,5
Wow! This game is just loaded with cool features to defend your dungeon!!,5
"I came into this hopeful. I saw the screenshots, listened to Horny and was genuinely enjoying reliving that dungeon keeper atmosphere... started up the game the game, slapped some minions, had trolls making traps, started digging out some rooms... and uninstalled as literally every single action I took in that game was asking me to spend money to do it faster.  They turned Dungeon Keeper into another Clash of Clans except they managed to have their in-app purchases tied to literally every single action you can take in that game.  If you are looking for another Dungeon Keeper then we still have hope that War for the Overworld will give us what we are looking for.",1
"Wasn't sure if like it as I'm not a big fan of tower defense, but this game rocks.",5
Great,5
Great,5
As good as the original,5
Interesting and pretty fun game,5
This game is awful. Any game with almost necessary pay to win mechanics deserves one star.,1
Killed the game and experience for me. You can get more *'s for $2.99 each (best value),1
I ate this tipe of game where you just log in 20 times a day and collect money and other crap that doesn't do anything,1
Instructions are very helpful and there is always something to do!,5
This is bad for everybody.,1
Finally something different  i like so far,5
Just as I remember it,5
"Very fun, creative, and dark game! I would certainly recommend giving this game chance! Does seem like a game that will eventually fizzle out once you get far into the game, but enjoy it until that time comes, because it's awesome!",5
Pretty decent game I must admit!,5
Good,5
Almost like the first one on the pc,5
Its slow but I like it a lot,5
"You've earned one star. To earn the other 4 stars please pay $120 worth of gems.  In all seriousness, EA is the only people who could ever mess up a dungeon keeper game.",1
So funny so fun! !,5
Great,5
Its amazing to play a game like this on my phone. Nicely done.,4
Fun,5
Easy to grasp game play.  Pretty fun game,5
Badass,5
"I was so stoked when I saw Dungeon Keeper, but it won't even start up.	DK was literally the best PC strategy game ever developed. After their company Bullfrog was bought up and disappeared, I always hoped that someday the game would pop up or manifest into something someday. I was so happy to see DK in the playstore and couldn't wait to download it. It never opened passed the loading screen. I uninstalled and downloaded it 3 times, and it never worked. I was really disappointed. Shame on you EA. You destroyed the best game ever. You'll never get any money from me ever again.",1
Pretty decent game,5
Awesome game I loved it on pc and this is better,5
^,5
Like the I dea,5
Ive played DK since I was a little kid and I absolutely love This game so far. Its like a mix between clash of clans and DK. I would like to see alliances of sorts but still... great game guys! So glad to see it coming back.,5
"What a load of pay to play crap. This would be a great game if it didnt take 24 hours or $2 to dig out one square. This free to play, pay to win crap is so bad now. I would gladly pay for the game if it didnt have in app purchases.  Way to ruin a great game. F*** YOU EA YOU GREEDY BUNCH OF DOUCHEBAGS!!!!!!!!",1
I've only been playing for about 20 minutes and I love it!!,5
I love how the game is strategic.,4
Fun,5
Great game so far. It's cracking me up.,5
Fun,5
I can't believe how much I enjoy the thrill of sending minions all over to do my bidding,5
Amazeballs,5
I like it.,5
Yay,5
Great and keeps me on my toes,5
Great love it and the original.,5
"Gr8 game,but can you guys make a way to earn free gems? Ik u want money and stuff but can you add an Earn free gems button? Ty",5
Play it!,5
"Amazing game, so much better than any of the other strategy/building management games I've played.  Download now!",5
Its easy to pick up and play. And you cant beat free,5
I'm fed up with in app purchasing.  If you have paid money to this greedy company you should be ashamed.,1
I downloaded this game and found it to be quite fun. But I uninstalled it because it started giving me pop-ups and messages about apps I didn't care about.,2
Awsome,5
This is pretty true to the original but geared toward mobile. Pretty good stuff.,4
I have been searching for this game for years for the computer!  Now I get to play it on the go!!!!! I am so excited!!! Now all we need is another pc version to go with it!,5
"A so-so variation of the old computer game. They made it very cartoony for kids and unfortunately you have to spend real money unless you want to spend all your time waiting to play and very little actually playing I would rather pay for the game outright and not have to spend 5$ for every new worker, will be uninstalling",1
Great game ever its not like the other ones,5
Amazing,5
Good game,5
Very enjoyable dungeon raiding/building game,5
Kol,5
Love it! One of my favorite games even on the pc.,5
I love this game.,5
"The humor is there, though I'm a bit concerned about the IAPs.  EDIT: Rating lowered to one star.  The IAP structure is absurd.  Look for NerdCubed's video review on YouTube if you want to see how bad it is for yourself.",1
Sweet,5
Fun addicting,5
Good,5
Great game. Fun mechanics great childish humor. Love it,5
Awesome game blast from the past,5
Love it,5
Its pretty unique,5
Wow! Going back in time. I remember this game! Awesome and even better now!,5
Great game,5
"The graphics are fun and well done. The animations are top notch... and that's ALL the good I can say about this game.   You can either wait or pay.  Want to upgrade a room or minion? Wait or pay. Want to summon a minion? Wait or pay. Want to dig anything other than soft dirt? Wait or pay.  Gems are ridiculously hard to come by. The rewards for achievements are stingy. The COST of gems for purchase in game is ludicrous. Once you run out of gems, you're done. Pay or stop playing.  One of the more annoying 'features' is the defense 'Raid' where your dungeon is invaded by minions FAR stronger than your own and best of all. Once your minions are deployed you have no control over them. They'll wander off after a fight and stand in one corner of your dungeon while the enemy ravages your rooms and destroys your dungeon heart.  I played the original back when it  was released. This is an insult to its memory. EA, you get none of my money.",2
I've played the original DK for years. This is a nice mix of old fashioned fun and new time crunch gaming,5
"It may feel a bit repetitive at first but hang in there, you unlock more things as you go. The tactics are a bit too basic for me. I like bigger dungeons and better control over my minions. Thats all I could ask for. I already spend hours waiting for my minions to finish building, battles arnt that long. So longer battles atleast.",5
"Awful micro transactions, makes the game unplayable.",1
"Tldr; IAPs destroy a faithful remake of a classic RTS.   I've been known to go for IAPs when they enhance game play and are reasonably priced, but this is obscene. Without them, you're restricted to 2 imps and the best routes that you can use for your dungeon layout are near impossible (1 tile = 24 hours real time; 1 leg = 9 days; completed route is &gt;1 month). The cost of buying the currency is over $100. For reference, the PC version of this game (circa 1997), currently sells for $5.99 and isn't hobbled.",2
It is good,5
Wish it di not take soo long on the clearing out and more imps  love this game,5
I used to play Dungeon Keeper on the PC years ago. This brings back a lot of memories and is still extremely fun!,5
"Pretty cool, but kinda slow",5
Pretty awesome game so far.,5
Another microtransaction black hole where there is no game unless you spend insane amounts of money. Stop supporting these kinds of scams.,1
Keeps locking up.,3
Just like every other game out there right now.,2
Fun and addictive building game.,5
Easy to start and some decent depth.,5
Awesome and fun,5
Enough said,5
"Great fun......however, its another free game that u cant really progress in without buying things in game",5
Great game,5
Super fun like a TD and anti TD plus a farm all in one pretty sweet,5
"Another must be logged in fiasco a LA Sim City (strike 1). Another spend unlimited amounts of cash fremium app (strike 2). Imp takes 4 hours to mine one block so it is completely unplayable without spending copious amounts of cash (strike 3). Uninstalled. To bad really, this was a brilliant franchise.",1
Yup,5
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhh awesome,5
Great game! Lots of fun!,5
Good fun if you're looking for simple RTS gameplay.,5
I LOVE IT,5
Why does this need wireless connection? This is crap.,1
"Just started game, but it is enjoyable to play.",5
Everything works well and it looks great,5
Dont really understand this game,2
It's awesome!!!!,5
Cool,5
I played this on PC when it was developed by bullfrog. I think the transition to mobile is great and it still has the same feel to it. 5 stars!,5
Amazing graphics! Very addictive,5
AWESOME,5
Fun,5
Loved playing the previous versions on pc.,5
Love the old first dungeon keeper needs more Pc quality for more dungeon keeper likeness,5
It's a fun game to play when you got nothing to do.,5
One of the only games that hold my attention for more than a few times. Great game.,5
Really fun,5
Addictive,5
Not like the old ones but still good in a new way,5
"After a few times of playing, now it won't load.",2
I used to love this game so much when I was growing up. Played it for hours. I wish i could play it but it won't work &lt;\3 totally a bummer.,1
It is a really good game in my opinion,5
Addicted,5
"I enjoy the Dungeon Keeper franchise a lot. It was one of the first games that I really got into and one of the best rts franchises around. This addition simply disappoints because of the micro-transaction aspect taking over the game entirely after the tutorial and its lack of the twisted charm of the original. I tried to like this game, but was unable to. EA does it again.",1
It's everything it boasts and tons of fun.,5
The original was much better on PC back in the day.,2
Just amazing,5
Best game ever Dude,1
This game is cool as ishh,5
"A little complicated, but fun never the less",4
Runs smoothly and is very fun,5
Loved this on pc.  So glad to have it mobile.,5
"It installed, loads game then shuts off! That's bullshit!",1
Love tjis app,5
A cool game,5
I really like it,5
Nice slow but nice,5
Slow... Dull... Pay $$$ to play...,2
You need to bring in possession of your imps. The game would be much better,4
So far so good 5*s. We will see if any issues arrive later,5
Quite fun,5
Super awesome game,5
Great game.!,5
Great,5
It's a fun game :),5
Easy play n control. Nice graphic too,5
This is my type of game,5
I was paid $10 by EA to write this review,5
"What a pathetic, money-grabbing, boring slog. It takes days to build anything at all, and even buying a ""premium"" version only upgrades you for 7 days, then you need to pay again. (At $8 a week, that's over $32 a month!) And it will cost far more if you want more minions or pretty much anything else. On top of that, it harassed you every 30 minutes to keep things moving.  All for a ""game"" that isn't even fun to play.  Save your time and bandwidth,  and go find an actual game to play.",1
Awesome,5
Similar to other games like dragons world but with a more dnd/rpg theme,5
M,5
Well made,5
"Games like this are killing the mobile gaming industry. It's nothing but a blatant, transparent cash grab. You simply cannot win without in-app purchases. They are not interested in making a good game, only in wringing as much cash out of you as they possibly can and then tossing you aside like a dish rag.  IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME AND YOU ARE MAKING IN-APP PURCHASES, YOU ARE HELPING TO DESTROY THE GAMING INDUSTRY!  :(",1
Cool,5
Nostalgia.,5
Fun,5
"This game is garbage. The originals were awesome, and is now garbage thanks to their ""pay to breathe"" model.  Im disappointed and will now be wary of any future EA mobile games.  Funny, I STILL dont have to pay to play Angry Birds.   Too bad EA isn't innovative enough to make money without alienating their fan base.  Bye Bye Electronic Arts.",1
Reminds me if the old days on PC. Great fun for new keepers and retro keepers alike,5
Just watch the times on the digging.,5
This has awsome graphics,5
Awesome game,5
Micro transactions slow the game down to a halt unless you pay exorbitant amounts of money to speed it up.,1
Great,5
Awesome little game,5
Pretty fun. Lots of variations on what you can do,5
good dungeon game,5
Humorous as well,5
Lol,5
Greattttt,5
This game could never get better thank you for people who made this game is awesome no other games that are played can stop it.,5

This is an amazing game,5
Awesomeness,5
Great game different from the classic but it works five stars.,5
Reminds me of the old days on PC! Works great and tons of fun! Very easy to use and tutorial is very smooth and easy to understand.,5
"Just a mindless grow an army, destroy everything type game. Hours of entertainment.",5
Great voice acting. Good humor and fun game play.,5
Love the old school game,5
Fun game still learning just asked to rate 5 stars for gems so I am.,5
Absolute garbage. Do not play this. Do not pay for micro transactions. Just stop.,1
"Like most mobile games of this genre, this game has been carefully structured by business types to milk users for cash. Progress is slow and limited unless you're willing to shell out dollars. This is an insult to the original Dungeon Keeper games, which were far more engaging and enjoyable.",3
Must play forever!,5
good game,5
Just like the original,5
Another win wonderful grand to waste time too.,5
Good game so far... hoping it doesn't slow down to much. I Don't like paying for free games.,5
Well done.,5
Love it,5
Generic build defence but with fun graphics,5
I like it,5
Yoay,5
a lot of fun!,5
Pretty good but takes some getting used to,5
Nothing like the original. Completely dominated by micro transactions.,1
Awesome,5
Really fun and addicting. Similar to CoC.,5
Its preety fun.,5
Ok so far,5
Loved the first game and this is a lot like it,5
Love this game!!!!!! &lt;3,5
It's not that bad I  guess,5

Almost as good as the original but none the less amazin,5
Excellent,5
Love it fresh and smooth,5
So far this game is very similar to the old game that I enjoyed,5
Fun to play,5
Game is amazing,5
"Represents the total destruction and monetization of a classic game. There is no gameplay, only paying money.",1
Rad,5
"Loved this game on Pc back in the day.  Did a good job with the mobile, though it shouldn't require online. :(",5
"Hi, just started but had the original game back in the day. Love the remake so far.",5
Such a fun throwback,5
Not as good as the pc but cool,5
Ea has a great game here. Its awesome,5
"Very fun to play and you get addicted, fast!",5
At times is tedious but def. Great to pass time two thumbs up,5
The best,5
"This game is really fun, and the things the Red guy says are absolutely hilarious.",5
Great time killer.  Very enjoyable,5
A Bit laggy for HTC one overall great game.,5
Dk,3
Loved the original game and now it's back!,5
This a good game,5
Has good graphics,5
"Great game,amazing battle system and so much fun",5
This game is way too complex for a phone and is boring,1
Cool,5
Kool game!!! I like slapping imps. Makes me feel IMPortant. Hehe,5
A little ruff starting up up fun once you get going,5
Loving every minute,5
Great game.....good way to waist time,5
IT'S  so  cool  IT  blos  my  mind.,4
Amazing game,5
Really freakin fun,5
"Find the originals, this one is not worth it",2
"Not as good as the original, but VERY FUN!",5
This game is very fun and exciting.. great job,5
Very fun,5
Game has trouble maintaining saved games.  Often boots you back to beginning.  Wait til they fix the bugs.,1
Childhood memories,5
I LOVE the old dungeon keeper games. Let's hope that this good. So far it been nice!,5
Great game,5
Just plain out awesome!,5
"This game is not free nor should it be, but the in app purchases are a scam. You will spend way more money playing this game with in app purchases than if you could actually just buy the game for a set price and then play for fun. Right now it is a constant pay to play which is no fun at all.",1
Great game reminds me of people version,5
Still good though,5
"Excellent, brings back a lot of old pc memories. Happy to see the big red guy doing his thing again.",5
I like it,5
Something different and if you like syrategic games yull like this one,5
I loved playing this on PC back in the day. It has the same humor and love the revamped characters. Keep up the good work....I just might find a digital version of DK 2 now lol,5
Yeah,5
Awsome!,5
Good audio with interactive visuals makes this more entertaining than other similar games,5
"This is quite a game, love it.",5
If you try this game you will find it hard to stop playing.,5
I've been looking for a different game besides CoC and this one really seems to grab my interest,5
Great game overall,5
Hi,5
Original and very good,5
This was my favourite pc game. I'm so beyond stoked for this app!,5
Awesome game,5
Its tons of fun,4
Cool,5
"The game looks fun but i  can't even open its because of "" code 7""",1
This game is a straight up 5 stars for good graphics and grewt gameplay!,5
It's pretty good game. It's a lot like Clash of Clans.,5
It's so nice to have a Dungeon Keeper on a mobile device,5
Fun game,5
Good,5
Lol,5
Good game,5
Yay yay yay,5
"Love the game, but the micro transactions kill it.",1
Wow!!,5
"Love it! so addicting, a must have!",5
I always played the old pc version and still do great app love it,5
I have missed DK and while this is different I still feel nostalgic.,5
I'm enjoying all the witty jokes,5
Great game.,5
Very fun.,5
"Great game, almost as good as the original!",5
Havent played a nice dungeon crawler esc game in a while,5
Really fun and addictive,5
Super good,5
Must play,5
"Needs Google plus. What the heck man, screw that",1
"I grew up with this game on pc, to be able to play it on my phone, takes me back",5
BAANANAFEFOFANA,5
Great fun game,5
Aweome game I feel so.....evil mwahahaha,5
Then how about a stable server?  Seems like a fun game but I have to reconnect to the server every couple of minutes.  Unplayable.  I guess that's EA for you.,1
I loooove dungeon keeper! I can remember beating it over and over on my old PC as a kid. I don't like how they've made it a waiting game where you have to have money now. It should be just like the old PC version storyline and all just with more maps and the option to play other people. Dungeon keeper fanatic for life though!!!! One of the best strategy games ever,4
Good,5
"Really easy to learn, funn, adictive and no glitchs or adds!",5
Loved this game then love it now,5
A lot of fun.,5
Cool game,4
Really fun and cool you will like,5
Great!,5
Cool,5
Enjoyable dialogue having a ball,5
I'm not even sure you can call this a game. Its a scam to extract money from you. Its not even remotely fun.,1
"This game was awesome on my pc, now its on my tablet. Danger zone!",5
"After playing for a while I decided that it is not as good as the original. You have to build items in certain sizes and can not build rooms touching each other. And if you attack some one, I can not find how to control each unit. They will bypass the hart to go after enemies that are on the other side of the board",3
"I loved the original DK as a kid, and this new version does capture the feel of the classic games quite well, if in a diluted form from being a mobile game. I hope EA eventually gives us a new full-fledged DK.",5
"You must pay to win and it has no offline mode, you know, so they can require you to pay. Nothing like the original.",1
=o,5
"Awesome game, addicting",5
Blatent cash grab from a once great game.  800 crystals for a 3rd imp?  You have to be joking me!  4 hours for 2 imps to earn 12 crystals and that's with keeping them going at 2x speed!,1
This game rocks,5
Kinda confusing but fun,4
The service is so bad I can only get on like every blue moon,1
Very fun,5
I can actually enjoy a good game for once!,4
Great adapt brings back old days of computer version,5
The entire game is microtransactions.,1
No thanks.,1
"While it lacks some of the more mature themes from the original, this is a good mobile reboot. Well done!",5
"Don't know why people can't play this great game , maybe they should get better electronics or stop downloading garbage :)",5
Good,5
Loads of fun,5
Great game!,5
Nice game good graphics.,5
Is amazayn.period.,5
It's good,5
Enjoying it so far,5
Amazing!!!!!!!,5
I've missed this game ever since DK II wouldn't work on any new computers. The only thing that sux is that I remember is that imps could work on the same tile/trap/etc,5
Too slow and buggy,2
This is a good game,5
"Fun, takes forever to load, crashes frequently",2
Really fun,5
Just reset all of a sudden lost everything good thing I didn't  spend any money,1
A very well made game,5
"I played the first dungeon keeper game when I was a kid. It was great and I love the franchise. This game could have been great but microtransactions completely killed any chance of that happening. Lets make this clear if you haven't played the original (which you can find online for ~5$), it should take you about 2 minutes to dig out a huge room. Not the 2+ hours EA is trying to sell you. Make the game the way it was meant to be and I would happily pay 10$ for it, but not like this, not ever.",1
It's a nice cross between city building and tower attack /defense,5
Requires google plus and too much access. Network connection required.,1
Better than most mmo strategies i've played in a while,5
It's like a cross between the old dungeon keeper with the time based building akin to clash of clans. Fun times. Here's hoping they add some kind of teams... alliances or guilds...,5
"I've always loved the Dungeon Keeper franchise and am enjoying this one so far. Hopefully it's not overrun with CC players, that's enough to ruin a game like this.",5
Interesting game,4
Jk,5
Awesomeness,5
Funny voice overs and pretty smooth gameplay.,5
Good game! Poppa like!,5
Great game,5
no comment,5
Usually pretty good games,5
'Nuff said.,5
Great game! Extremely addicting!!!,5
I loved playing this game on PC way back in the day . This version is not bad at all for a mobile version . Its slightly different but still very good .,5
Funny and hilarious at the same time,5
Good stuff,5
Awesome,5
I like it,5
Fun,5
Cool game.,5
You have to pay a pound or wait 24 hours to dig out one plot of land.,1
Awesome,5
Cool as hell,5
This game was great on the PC.  I'm glad to see it back in action.,5
"missed this Game I'm so glad they brought it back, but of course ea seems to have screwed it up. I really wish they would stick to sports games",3
Good times,5
Get an error every time I try to install.,1
Very addicting.,5
I havent eaten for 7 weeks im thirsty,5
Yup,5
Good stuff.   Crafty mimic of clash of clans.,5
Galaxy tab 3 working great,5
I love the old of version. This is a decent update.,5
"Love this game, I recommend it to people who aren't so sure about this game.",5
Yup.,5
I'm liking this game so far..,5
"I was a big fan of the original dungeon keeper and dungeon keeper 2 on PC.  This game is all about how to convince you to buy more gems.  I understand they do need to make money, but don't say a game is free and then expect you to pay $20+ to make it anywhere in the game.",2
Good game to kill time with. Great humor and fun building your own evil lair to hide in.,5
Good star. Lets see where it goes...,4
If you're patient you don't have to buy gems. I just switch it on every now and then and kill some stuff. Great game,5
Good times,5
Micro transactions prevent this from being a playable game in any form.,1
Great game,5
Keeps checking for updates...,1
Yea,5
Love the commentary and bad puns. Game play is super fun too,5
Fun,5
Very good in explaining how too play and it gets addicting as you go,5
Pretty fun time waster,5
Awesome combination of strategy games!,5
Enjoying the game,5
Great game,5
I really like this game because I always liked dungeon keeper on my computer and this game isn't exactly like it but its still cool,5
"Do you have lots of money? Are you a spoiled brat? Are you just plain stupid? Play Dungeon Keeper MOBILE! It's the dig 'em out that just keeps on diggin' (for your wallet)! Nothing like the original pay-then-play like the originals, it's now converted to the awful pay-TO-play that suckers idiots into paying EA for DAMNED GEMS. The demons in this game are supposed to be building a dungeon, not a monopoly under the name ELECTRONIC ARTS! Comic Book Guy would call it the ""Worst. Game. Ever.""",1
Best update of one of my favorite PC games.,5
Fun,5
Awesome play. Highly addictive,5
Finally an absolutely great game...if I had a complaint which I don't it takes awhile to build up..but all in all a lot of fun!!!,5
A lot like clash of clans,5
Awesome,5
Its a great time absorber for when you need to kill some time,5
Bert then the ordinal game by far,5
This game rocks. Fact,5
Played this back in the day.  Seems like I'm right back there!,5
Good game. Though it functions like a facebook game and not like it should.,5
I've been waiting for this for a long time,5
Outstanding EA Best game I have played on my phone and best game with graphics respectively,5
I used to play this on my old computer! I loved it! But when I got a newer faster computer it didn't work!,5
Go buy it on GOG and run it on dos box. This is a joke.,1
Great game,5
Fun,5
Very cool,5
Just like nerd 3 said,1
I like it,5
Almost as good as the PC game.,5
"This game looks great, sounds great. It's impossible to sit and pay because to work the dungeon you have to constantly wait or buy",1
The microtransactions are terrible and the grind is the worst I've ever seen in a microtransaction based game,1
"I wish it was just the regular game, but great translation ""optimized for tablets"" clearly meant in game purchases, though.",5
:),5
Great game and is fun to pass time,5
Fun time so far,5
"Love it. Its a great dungeon master tower defense game. Just started, its slow, but as all good things to those who plan well.",5
Great game,5
A fun game with great voiceovers and tutorials.,5
"Great game. Good graphics, fun gameplay. It's kind of like a very highly interactive tower defense game with a lot more strategy and leveling up your dungeon. Only thing I can complain about is that I feel like they're should be a raid option that you can do against NPCs, but without being on campaign. Kind of like a challenge mode, just so you can build up resources and gain better strategizing plans. Also, the size of the dungeon is a little limiting, plus imps are ridiculously pricy for no reason at all.",4
Very fun and addicting; similar to clash of clans,5
enjoyable and fun to play,5
Great feel of the original PC version,5
This was one of my favorite games as a kid,5
Awful micro transactions,1
This is cool,5
Fun,5
...but it will take you $600 and a month to unlock it. If you love the original game then you owe it to yourself to pretend that this version doesn't exist.,1
EA destroyed a great dungeon game like everything they get there hands on. Wish they revive the game not destroy its reputation with this cheap cheesy pg knockoff. Its like any other pay to play if you really want to get any where in the game or accomplish anything you need to invest in time and cash.,2
I loved the original Dungeon Keepers and I was stoked to see this in the play store! I downloaded and played it only to realized that it was horribly ruined by the mobile freemium model. That's EA for ya. I would have paid up to $10 if this was based on microtransactions.,2
Love this game,5
Exceptionally fun,5
Old school great,5
You should install this game.,5
Good,5
Cool,5
Devilishly cool,5
With out transactions and etc can't really play the game.,1
Nice,5
Extremely fun nd very creative love how funny it is as well,5
Very addicting:),5
Fun game so far,5
Great strategy game with great graphics. Very nice.,5
Nostalgic update of the classic dungeon keeper games.,5
Fun game!,5
Good but too focused on making me pay to get five stars.,4
"Cool, game if you can get a steady internet connection....Don't forget to slap your Imps",5
Awesome!,5
"No problems, downloaded the game, it up a Dated when it was first launched. Connected it to my Google account and am playing. So far no issues. Opens, plays and closes just fine. It isn't perfect of course but what is in this life?",4
Cool game!,5
Fun,5
As good as I remember from the old days. Just slight lag on a zte savvy,5
Awesome fun game! I'm glad someone brought it back.,5
Good game,5
"Most games with micro trans. let you play a few hours before suckering you for currency. Within a few moments of  tutorial ending, the upgrades & structures take 10-45 minutes to complete without paying to rush. While they do give you a few hundred it's currently impossible to earn enough for more Imps, to do more than one thing at a time.  No errors here, people disconnecting must have bad connections.  Try Jurassic Park game instead, if you desire a similar concept, with less $ & faster progression.",2
Hell yes so glad this game is here. Just like the old days.,5
Yuhp,5
Cool,5
Awesome game,5
Very fun enjoyable game!,5
Love it,5
Great fun,5
I like games better when I don't have to wait 4 hours or pay money to mine through one tile.,1
Very fun.,5
Enough said,5
They did great job of bringing the classic back the only thing i would change is the wait times,5
I like this game its funny and fun nothing wrong with it yet that I know of,5
Great,5
Not a big fan of the real time waiting thing but love this game,5
Entertaing,5
"Dungeon Keeper was once a fun game.  This trend of free-to-play games slowed to a crawl unless you pay with micro transactions has destroyed another possible great title.  Who has the time to check in every four hours to mine one chunk of gems anyway?         EA,  let me pay $30 once and put the game back the way it used to be!",1
"Nice twist to the resource, defend, raid type games",5
Dope game,5
I used to have this game for my computer.  Brings back lots of fond memories of whipping minions into shape,5
Been anticipating the retell of toys game on android,5
This is not dungeon keeper. It is a micro transaction filled waiting simulator. Breaking one wall square takes 24hours. Of course this can be sped up for $2,2
Is he is mend,5
installed and deleted  once it became clear that this game is unplayable without endless micro transactions costing more than a full console game. despicable greedy behavior,1
This a fun game,5
"Instead of being a crook, just charge 19.99 for the game instead of making people buy F@#%! Gems	You suck",1
Love it!,5
Anyone who actually gave this POS greed crap from EA 5 stars should be ashamed. Not only does it perpetuates the greed by developers but frankly a waste of money. I'm not opposed to IAP when it is done right but here it is absolutely the worst of the worst. I actually played this game on the PC and was excited that it was coming to mobile. EA once again ruined it and EA is shady bullocks.,1
Can't even get it past the loading screen it says  just checking for updates please fix this and I will  and I will rate 5 stars  I have A Dell venue 8 inch,1
Good,5
Its like clash of clans but its better,5
Great game lots of fun,5
I like it way more then clash of clans,5
Love the battle,5
Very fun,5
Legit,5
Best game ever,5
Good,5
I love it so far its alot of fun and runs well overall a good game :),5
Hi,5
Mindless fun,4
Better than clash of clans. Great job guys!,5
If you love clash of clans you will love this game also,5
Not my type of game,3
Game,5
Microtransactions galore. Do not get this game.,1
Right on,5
For updates,5
Its cool,5
Uninstalled,1
Awsome,5
Easy and simple to understand while still maintaining the gripping entertainment needed for a great game. Aaaand its free at that!,5
"Has many similar sets of tools, dungeons and minions as the original. A must if you enjoyed the old pc game.",5
Creative idea following the classic Tower Defense craze,5
Unique just like clash of clans,5
Nice  game,5
Really fun and funny,5
Many much fun,5
"Just jumped into it, but so far this game has me very impressed & thrilled as a result!",5
Amazing,5
If you like clash of clans you will love this game.,4
Keeps me busy when im waitin for troops on clash of clans,5
Great and exciting fun.....a great spin on a ton of games out already,5
:P,5
Runs great!,5
I play this on the computer and now... Its tablet ready....Thanku thanks thanks.... My favorite game.... Is now my favorite game again...,5
Best game I've played in a while,5
I've played a few ports but this is by far the best.  I love the classic play of dungeon keeper and the fact that that play is preserved and brought back in this mobile port is amazing.,5
Lots of fun,5
Pretty dern fun.,5
It's a fun lil game,5
"I would give zero stars if it were possible. In app purchases render this game unplayable for days. If you've ever played the original game, you'd know this game is an utter rip off. In app purchases have ruined the mobile platform and this abomination of a game is a prime example of that.",1
Alot of the concepts have been copied from the original Clash of Clans,3
It's cool,5
Lol,5
Just started but I like it.,5
Someone tell me who voices the demon...cus i luv his voice,5
Yup,5
THE BEST GAME EVER,5
Great twist on the build your base games. Lots of fun.,5
Very unique and cool game closely related to Clash of Clans,4
Pure awesome fun,5
Awesome game,5
Nice game,5
"I'll go play the old game, maybe if you made it like the original and just charged people upfront it would be fun. But waiting 2 hours to dig a wall is not in anyway fun",1
Addicting and fun! Cool concept 5/5,5
New and brilliant game,5
Pretty good game,5
T.y love,4
It won't load to play! And after reading the reviews it doesn't sound like I'm missing out on much. Uninstalling!,1
"Yes, you will like it.",5
Great game,5
Hell yes!,5
So fun,5
This game is awesome you should play it! :),5
Very fun n different then a lot of other games... I have played it for about 2 hours so far n see myself playing it for months...,5
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,5
Its oblock 3000,5
Oh man its addicting,5
This game is so cool!,5
Awesome game,5
Love it!!,5
To bad I miss the old school game need to bring it back,5
Gear,4
This game is truly a Pay to Win title. Even the blocks you have to destroy take freaking 24 hours while the original pc game takes 2 seconds!,1
Best Ever!,5
Fun game,5
Cool,5
"Fun and balanced, although the mining times could be lowered a little",5
Hi,5
Easy to play,5
Designed to drain your wallet.,1
Very entertaining!!,5
Great dungeon game,5
Reminds of the good old days,5
"The game seems like it could be a lot of fun but it's built to make you pay real money in order to do anything.  To dig one block (depending on type) will take either 4 hrs or 24 hrs.  So unless you pay real money for ""gems"" this game is a waste of time.",2
"Of mobile games, and their reviews is ignore all five star reviews. More often than not those reviews are given by the asinine, or blinded individuals. This game is as bad as everyone who says it is, is. I very much doubt it will ever be anything better than the terrible junk it is now - especially given EA's track record. Everything that was great about the original has now been chained down, and extremely restricted by micro-transactions; and, if you want to play with any of the staples you have to pay.",1
Don't love the in-app $$  But still psyched to see it,4
Brings back memories or yore,5
Casual and humorous,5
Very fun,5
Coooooool,5
"This is nothing like the original series, and should not use the name dungeon keeper",1
So far this game is pretty awesome. But if you don't have patience this game is not fo you.,5
The license agreements allow EA to share personal and phone info with a number of companies. The agreement is ridiculously long and clearly meant to deter you from understanding what you are agreeing to. I won't reward a  company that spies on and deceives its customers.,1
Like clash of clans,5
"This game has to be the worst of all time. If you are a nerd like me, and a smart one at that, you will 1 love the original and 2 hate anything to do with micro-transactions. This game is the most greedy game in the world, if you remember dungeon keeper you will know that you mine out tons of blocks to help you. This game will take you at least 4 hours, if not a whole day to mine out ONE. You can spend actual money to speed it up, but you will have to pay about 70 USD to mine 60 blocks DO NOT GET!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Great game,5
R R R R4rrrrrrrrrr AAR R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R,3
I played this game as a kid and I still like it,5
But good so far ...,4
Exelent game,5
Its seems like a really high quality game that I think would be great on an actual gaming console.........like ps4 maybe,5
Love it on the pc as well,5
Super Fun A Little Laggy At Times But I'm Sure it's Just y Phones. other Than That I Love It,5
Awesome game,5
Just started playing and its already got me hooked,5
Love it,5
I like the game but I really wish some of the objects weren't so two dimensional,4
Oh the memories...,5
Its just awsome,5
"It takes too much time to interact with the game, you get bored before even trying to play",1
It's easy to see how this game could get addicting...,5
Awsome game,5
I likee iit,5
Amazing,5
You  need a distraction? This is it.,5
Great concept for a game  ruined by ea's need to alter games to force microtransactions,1
Awesome game,5
Congtats to my friends at Mythic Entertainment on a job well done,4
Fun and unique. Similar to clash of clans,5
Fun defense type game. Beware you probably need Wi-Fi to run it best,5
The in app purchases are beyond frustrating. So much so that you actually have to stop playing for 24 hours unless you pay way too much to speed things up.,1
Nice game!,5
Cool game,5
Sluggish,4
Intense,5
"I was very happy to see this app in the store. I finally remembered playing Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2 for the PC. When I saw this, I had to try. I was a little worried EA would ruin this like they have so many other games, but so far I am pleasantly surprise surprise have fun this has been.",5
Would be better if it was more like the original dungen keeper .. but all in all not bad,5
Good,5
"Let's get one thing out of the way: it's *not* Dungeon Keeper. Not really.  It's cute; a passable way of wasting some time, but it is most definitely just another ""F(r)ee-to-play"" title with a DK skin.  Better than some (at least there are *some* actual *game* elements), but not anything I will be investing any serious time in. There are *much* better options out there, even though they're still in beta.  And if it proves to be as *annoying* as The Simpsons: Tapped Out proved to be, it will be getting uninstalled without even a first thought. I do *not* put up with games that think it's OK to yell at me because I'm not playing often enough.",3
So fun,5
It's fun and cool,5
Goob game,5
gg,5
Awesome game,5
fun,5
New concept really becomes addictive fast.,5
This game is very fun and exciting,5
Don't download,1
Fun game,5
Awesome,5
This game is great so far. Just started but the graphics and take play are great. Would and will suggest it to people that play clash of clans but like this way better.,5
Good,5
Very fun and addictive,5
Familiar enough to be easy but still has a lot of personality all its own,4
Once I started I couldn't put it  down.  Better then clash of clans.,5
Very nice game and fun,5
Love the commentary during gameplay.  Great game thus far and Ive only been playin it for an hour.  Great art too,5
I love this game and can't put it down,5
"It was going pretty slow at first, but now its fine and extremely fun!",5
Keeps me on my toes.,5
Very fun and silly.  Great graphics and refreshing new style of gameplay make this tower defense game a sure 5 star,5
Awsome,5
Never played these games as I understand it this was a PC game. This will not disappoint and it very funny.,5
Amazing game especially if your a clash of clan fan this is deff another one to add to the list. Now I have something else to switch too while my builders are occupied on clash.. must download game plus its free what do you have to loose,5
I'm super happy to be able to play this again.,5
"I used to love playing DK on pc! It's about time it came to android. Great job, developers.",5
I issued the minion a dig command,5
"Reminds me of a game,but I forgot its name!",5
If you enjoy clash of clans this game is the game for you,5
There is something oddly satisfykng about smacking to ugly looking things called imps for twenty seconds,5
"If you've never played the original Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper 2, stop playing this piece of garbage and go to GOG and get both, fully unlocked, fast paced, and FUN games for the price of speeding up about 3-4 of the hardest squares in this atrocity. Do not spend money on this game, or waste your valuable time trying to play it for free with 24 HOUR long waits to dig out blocks. Go buy a real game and actually have fun playing rather than pay ridiculous sums to make this thing slightly less annoying.",1
Missed playing as a dungeon overlord,5
"Loved this game growing up, glad I can now play it on my phone.",5
Its almost like the quest for epic loot,5
This is a great action packed game with strategy.,5
Download it now!!!,4
Good game,5
I love the game! 5 stars,5
Crazy as hell but great,5
Cool game!,5
Old school meets new school tower defense style,5
Pretty good,5
Ruined a perfectly good game franchise with a pay-to-win model. Deleted minutes after I installed it.,1
About time! I missed you Horny!,5
I hate microtransactions..,1
Way better than Clash of Clans,5
Good start,5
True  to the classic game!! Love it,5
I love this game,5
"I do have some tolerance for micro- transactions, but gameplay is brought to a screeching halt more often than not in this title. EA games seems to have forgotten why people play games,  since they have sucked the fun out of the wonderful Dungeon Keeper series with this greed-laiden garbage.  Head to gog dot com if you want the real DK experience.",1
I remember the old dungeon keeper... This new one is great.,5
Great game,5
I like the idea of defending your base and attacking other peoples bases,5
A lot more fun than I was expecting! Lol,5
"Must be online to play, and constantly asks for my google plus account. Since when do games need to know so much about you personally?  After reading more reviews im glad I just deleted it. Micro transactions are ruining video games.",1
"I started playing and thanks to this game, I haven't seen my family in days. Thanks, Dungeon Keeper!",5
Just as the title reads,5
New life to an awesome old game! Micro transactions stink but game is fun.,5
"Great idea, different type of strategy game",5
Fun!!!,5
Great game,5
Slow version of a great game  imps too expensive.,4
Like it alot finally a game like this I can get into plus I enjoyed the original one!!!,5
Amazing great play,5
Cool,5
"I was a fan of the original PC game.  This game successfully ports DK to mobile while keeping the fun and feel of the original.  Great job, loving it so far.",5
"Another example of the problems with modern games. The asynchronous multiplayer (allowing you to attack other players while they're not playing), and build up your defenses is interesting, but it's balanced against an incredibly slow pace designed to drive the sale of 'gems', which can be used to activate faster building, various 'bonuses' (read: cheats), and to purchase resources.  You've played this game. Maybe it was called Farmville, or any of the other games that require you to return to them every hour or so, but you've played this. The asynchronous multiplayer doesn't make up for what amounts to next to no actual gameplay.",2
Reminds of the board game,4
Very fun,5
Will launch but have not been able to play. It just freezes every time.,1
Very fun game,5
This has different aspects of playing a traditional clan game it is gonna keep me entertained got a while,5
This game is great just kinda a glitchy title thing on the right side of the screen from time to time but game play and concept is great,5
"C I look funny, but yo I'm makin' money, see so yo world I hope you're ready for me. Now gather round I'm the new fool in town and my sound's laid down by the Underground. I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf so just let me introduce myself	Awesome",5
This is a good game,5
Good game to pass time,5
Great game,5
Try it,5
I loved the old pc games and this one rocks as a face book game,5
Lots to learn but looks great,5
This game is fun,5
It's cool,4
Brings back so many memories of the old PC game... can we get another EA?,5
Best game,5
It takes really long areas to dig. I don't like that part,5
"Decent building game, like the graphics, looks and plays good on tablet",5
"I love this game, its so hot",5
Great graphics and kind of like clash of clans which makes it a great game to kill time,5
Lots of fun,5
Great,5
Ea out did them self's again,5
Awesome game play it all day,5
Awesome,5
I love this game! It's the best ever!,5
Pretty cool game,5
Great game so happy they made one for mobile devices.,5
"This game is just broken, I came into this thinking I can relive some child hood memories. The game seemed fun at first, plenty of gems. I slowly filled up the middle bit of area you get. So I tried building on the outside. BUT IT TAKES 24 HOURS TO DESTROY ONE BLOCK, with the two umps your given it would take a month just clear up a small space. And them the gem price is stupid, 115 dollars for 500 gems? I can clear 56 spots, yay. NO THATS BULLSHIT. For that money I can buy 11 copies if DK 1 and DK 2.",1
Fun,5
This is an amazing game!!!!!!,5
Great game. Very reminiscent of the original.,5
Very fun not p2p,5
"Been waiting for another release in this series a long time. Good slightly dark humor is appropriately included. Micro purchases have so far not been necessary, but seem to be JUST helpful which is a welcome change.",5
I'm impressed by the graphics. It flows really nice on my g2,5
AWSOME !!!!!,5
Pretty good defending game.,5
Straight game play,5
Almost bettet than thr pc  version.,5
A good game I will continue to play for a long time.,5
Awesome pure awesome,5
Loved DK2 and I love DKMobile.,5
"This game is so good, the mining takes a bit but over all its a great game",5
Gives me a java error. Galaxy s epic,1
"It brings me back to my high school days,  love it!!",5
Pretty good so far,5
Great way to mix tower defender with civilization creater!!,5
new game,5
Love this game,5
Great little game.,5
Except all of the microtransactions,1
Good game I definitely like the voice. Keep up with updates and I think the game will be nice,5
"Great game, can't stop playing just make sure your near good wifi for initial update or it will take FOREVER but other than that no problems so far, couldn't put my phone down when i first got it.",5
Like it!,5
Took a restart after loading but no screw ups during game play since.,5
Nice,5
It's an entertaining game. Worth checking out.,5
This game is probably better than clash of clans.,5
I used to be mad dungeon keeper wouldn't install to newer computers Thanks EA!,5
evil funny and fun,5
Great game,5
But so much better. Fun theme and innuendos.,5
Awesome,5
Intentionally slowed down to make you want to buy IAP. Plus it wants to collect your address book from email. No thanks.,2
Great fun,5
EA is greedy. I refuse to pay 50+ dollars to play a mobile app.,1
Takes me back,5
Good game,5
It has pretty nice graphics and is really entertaining!,5
"A nice twist on the ""clash of clans"" style games. Haven't been playing long but so far i love it!",5
2 Stars ($29.99) 3 Stars ($54.99) 4 Stars ($79.99) 5 Stars ($99.99) *BEST VALUE*,1
Great,5
"This game is very amusing and has a pleasantly dark theme. I've stopped playing Castle Clash to play this. It's truly  awesome and well worth the download. Solid gold, EA. Keep up the good work.",5
"Love the old dungeon keeper games, everything works. Wish there was a 1 time purchase of this game instead of a shop",5
Better than most of the builders out there,5
"Loved the original on the PC, and while this one has updated graphics, the constant increasing timers is crazy. 2 Gemstones for your first imp, 147 for the 2nd, 800 for the 3rd. To dig a regular wall, 15 sec, medium wall 4 hours, hard wall 1 day. With more imps you could do more, but imps cost gemstones which you can buy for real money or mine for them. See dig times above. There are no gems in a regular wall.",1
To your contacts and account the game is always running and sent out emails to my contacts.,1
But will this 5¬¢ & 10¬¢ model last,5
Love this game,5
I really have no idea why people are rating this more than 1 star. First off its a greedy smack in the face to the original Dungeon Keeper series. 2nd its just another stupid time drainer. If you have never played the original DK go find and play it. This game is just a bastardization of a title EA abandoned for no reason years ago.,1
It sometimes will crash on you but overall a great game,5
Great fun!,5
It constantly freezes and wont open ea is a terrible company hope they lose this lawsuit,1
One of the best games that I've played on android.,5
Love this game,5
Good,5
Really enjoying this game so far,5
Love it.,5
Fun! Better than clash of clans!,5
I like,5
"Cool game. Works great and is a lot of fun. Would give this a higher rating, but the expansion is limited do to gems. Its really hard to get gems thru gameplay. Another game just trying to suck money out of me.",2
I love this game it is super cool,5
But this one has Horny,5
Just started and it is very fun,5
Best game I ever had,3
Pure awesome XD,5
Super fun,5
Not a fan thought I was like the computer game nothing like it hate it,2
This is a great game,5
"Funny, Free, And Entertaining ? You guys fn Rule ! This game is truley fun. Thank You !",5
Love it,5
Good,5
Awesome game!!!,5
Thanks,5
This game has everything I like in it,5
Ok,5
Id recommend this game to anyone,5
A good game,5
Its back!,5
Fun!!!!!,5
"Definitely a great time sink, different enough to stand out from other games. Also the graphics are very nice!",5
I loved this game on the pc years ago and was hoping someone would remake it.  This is what I get?  What a rip off.  I'd rather pay $60 for a console version!,2
Would have paid for this game in order to rid of the time restrains but other wise this is a very good game,5
Fun,5
Awesome,5
"This is just sad, EA has just butchered one of my favorite games, you know what I don't like about strategy games, waiting 24 hours to build things expecting you to pay really money. I'd rather go buy the original game for 10 bucks on GOG than pay money for this pile of crap.",1
Fun.  Great graphics.,5
Fun game...,5
Love this game a lot.  Just wish you could rotate the perspective allowing visibility on all sides of the dungeon.  Other than that this game is really great.,5
Just got started but has potential :),4
While not the same as the origin all from bullfrog. It does give that nostalgia feeling which makes it enjoyable to play,5
Till it wanted me to pick a name the keyboard won't come up,1
"Hey EA, want more stars, that will be $69.99.  Seriously this game is fee-to-play not ""free"" to play.",1
Amazing really fun to play.,5
Loads of fun!,5
Its pretty good I love the concept,5
"I'm using an RCA tablet, an el cheapo, and this plays beautifully with no faults or slow downs. I foresee hours of fun play in my future.",5
All time favorite game!,5
Really cool game.,5
"Very creative and cartoon like game in nature, love it",5
This game is a lot of fun. Reminds me of the original games,5
"Crashes my phone within 5 seconds of finishing its crazy long load time. Makes me so sad, i loved this game om my PC.",1
Really good,5
And it's all that you remember it being. Loved the original. Now loving the mobile. DK! Ooh-rah!,5
It's cool,5
Good so far! Bringing back nostalgia big time... Would love a Steam release or something... *hint* *hint*,5
Domnic game so Gay and stupid -.- why the hell you guys make this horrible unbelievable thats Sad,1
ibid.,5
Has its comedy and hard ethics,5
Good,4
Fun game,5
"This game brings back all the classic fun of Dungeon Keeper to your modern, mobile device. My sister and I were big fans of Dungeon Keeper and are both thrilled to have this new edition.",5
Keep me posted on the way to the extent of the World.,5
#awesome,5
Love this game very challenging,5
Great game.... good old days,5
I played the original game on pc... This brings back memories... Fun too haha,5
Fasinating,5
Vertical Gold :-) game,5
Great little sinister game,5
Strangely enough fun game,5
Its alrght I could play it 4 a while,5
"I still have the 2 original games, and had mild success at loading them on W7. But have always wanted EA to do something with Bullfrogs best title. Glad to see they finally did!",5
Great graphics and gameplay... I'm hooked,5
Awesome game by a great team. Tons of fun!,5
"This game is a disgrace to the original dungeon keeper. It's supposed to be real-time strategy, not week long strategy.",1
"Needs fixing, sound stutters. Game freezes whole phone every 3-5 min, phone auto restarts. Would like to play this game.",2
Loved the original pc games. So far it is fun!,5
Uninstalled immediately.,1
I loved playing DK on the PC years ago. The tablet is the perfect place to bring this gem back. Thanks! ‚ò∫,5
Its so fun and addictive I love it :),3
"Somewhat confusing a first, but I like it",5
"Solid game, allows for both casual and competitive playing.",5
"Just what is needed, enough said",5
The graphics are sick and the user interface is amazing. Very detailed game with lots to keep you interested.,5
Just like I remembered,5
Awesome game,5
Digging time could b a little less time then 4 hours but great game so far,5
Almost as good as the original game,5
"Really fun, enjoyable and addictive so far",5
This is a fun and very detail oriented game. Love my minions Bahahaha,5
Bringing back an old classic...,5
nice game like it,5
Fun and easy to play,5
Its simple and keeps you interested,5
Fun game,5
Good game as long as you dont spend your gems until you get the just of things because their hard to come by unless you spend that cash. Still able to have fun without spending that chedder and that means FREE.,4
"I used to agree with the micro trans bashers. but now I get it. its casual folks. ur gonna stop anyway after a few minutes.  why not have something progress while you're offline?  give it longevity?  this was the brilliance of Eve's skill training.  besides my hand gets tired holding my phone anyway lol. this game is fun, so is clash of clans. and free.  and lasts years. so quit complaining and don't spend your money if you don't want to. login, enjoy briefly, logoff, repeat.",5
Just wish they would make these game a flat charge and no IAPs.,5
DK was one of my all time favorite PC games.  I have missed it since bullfrog stopped selling it and I lost my disk. When I heard the app was in development I couldn't wait to get it.  The app is everything g the PC version was and more. Totally worth the wait!,5
Got to gind ot out but it reminded me of dungeon keeper 2. After playing it still reminds me of DK2. Some slow features but if you were a fan of the old dungeon keepers then try ot out youll probably lile it.,4
Great so far.  We'll see what happens as I progress,5
Loved this game for the PC when I was growing up. Very excited to be able to play it again.,5
"Fun so far, there are in app purchases but you can get along without them.",5
Good fun!,5
Good stuff,5
Awesome live playin,5
Awesome fun.,5
I've played the original PC version. And now I'm excited to see a castle defense version where I can make my dungeon and kill the good guys!,5
Pretty freaking cool,5
I love the concept of this game it works really well.,5
Fun and somewhat true to the original.,5
Good,5
Best game ever:-D,5
Awesome game a must have for all ranges of skill sets. To the casual pick up game to the hardcore gamer!!,5
Takes to long to play if u don't buy gems. You have to keep waiting,3
An old classic reborn for mobile devices.,5
The game had great game play but even from the beginning you had would have to pay to really play the game.  I'm not one that is against paying to play games but in a game like this if you need to use in game credits right away then you know it will get expensive fast.,2
A little slow at times you can tell it's just a bit bugish but it's still a great game I'm sure in time those bugs will be worked out,5
Love it.  Just like the old game in the 90's!!!!,5
Raid game with a twist. Defend and attack in a whole new way.,5
I enjoyed the original dungeon keeper much more because it wasnt ftp. But its nice ea recognized a great game that would blend well with the other gem hungry games,5
Fun,5
Good game,5
Interesting time killer,5
Very fun and easy to pick up,5
Great,5
Its......still awesome....just....taking time,5
Fun,5
Enjoyed it,3
Addictive game,5
It keeps shutting down after I build an object or attacking(annoying)..fix for better rating,3
"Like a death metal castle defence. Looks amazing too, can't belive its not a paid app",5
:),5
Very fun and addicting. Good time killer,5
Its the ultimate strategy and tower defense game,5
Better than anything else,5
Very well developed.,5
This game is horribly unbalanced. Whatever defense you create it doesnt help. In a nut shell: this game f%! $@ng sucks! EA just wants your money and doesn't care about the players enjoyment.,1
Good,5
Cool,5
Glad it came to the phone.,5
Good game,5
LOVE THIS GAME,5
Jool,5
Cool game,5
Fun fun,5
FEELIN THIS GAME,5
Generic pay and play,4
Pretty fun game.,4
love it.  r‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨¬∂¬∂¬∂¬∂¬∂er,5
Fun,5
O dungeon keeper I'll throw some money at that 5 minutes later trying to get a refund.,1
Fun game,5
New take on a clash of clans type game.,5
Lots of fun reminds me of the original games. Dear ea please do dk3!!!,5
Fun so far,5
Fun game,5
30 mins in already addicted.,5
Doesn't load. Waste of time.,1
It so fun and funny,5
Goooood,5
Passes time by but to many of these games out now. Need originality,5
Jj,5
"Nice graphics, and entertaining",5
Fun to play.,5
Okay.,5
Tons o evil fun.,5
Awesome game,5
A ton of fun. What's next?,5
Fun game.,5
I played this game so much before on the computer. Now it's on my phone. The fun shall never end.,5
Cool,5
Fun game. Enjoying it so far,5
Reminds me of clash of clans....only darker.,5
So far so good,5
Easy play..great graphics!,3
"Love it, like the older PC types.",5
Just awesome nuff said,5
I'll be back in the New York,5
"So I have been looking for a game to pull me into it, and here it is. Tldr; fun. Get it.",5
"Good shop far,  good concept,  fun stuff.",5
Love it great game,5
Yup,5
"So I love how this is the 3rd game from EA I have DL and/or purchased, and when I run the program it closes....wtg EA always screw us and never give any support because you know your games dont work on more than 75% of users devices... EA the software WH0123s of gaming.... sad...",1
I loved the originals and this is a fun mobile take on the classic game,4
"Game doesn't work on my Galaxy S. But that is pry just 'cause it's old. Receiving ""Error Code 7""",2
Loved the old dungeon keepers and good way to make it for mobile.,5
Fun to play. Makes me want to play the old game again,5
Pretty fun to have power.,5
Fun game,5
Fun game with well thought out and wonderfully designed mechanisms without fault.,5
I honestly got excited seeing that the Dungeon Keeper series finally had a new game in its line. Now I feel like they should have just kept it buried. Just Dungeon Keeper in name... Not close to the real thing. Another crappy EA time waster. So sad.,1
Its like a better version of dungeon overlord,5
"This game really looks like one I would love to play on my Tab 3 but its not compatible, if EA could get this out for more devices it would be awesome. :)",4
"What more can you say? I'm running it on an iView 777TPCII tablet I got for $59, and it looks and sounds beautiful and plays smoothly! Definitely worth the install!",5
"Played game for an hour, then suddenly, it started from the very beginning with the tutorial and I lost everything. Thank go I'd not purchased anything!!",1
"This is not Dungeon Keeper. This is some bastardised ""freemium"" trash that vaguely reminds me of a game I knew and loved during my childhood that happens to share the same name. I'm hugely disappointed...",1
Fun,5
"Another unplayability bad ""freemium"" game. Game play consists of click, wait minutes to hours, click, wait, etc. Nothing like the original dungeon keeper.",1
Love it :-D,5
Love the idea 9 the game.  Can't stop playing it and I have to work in the morning so you tell me if it addicting or not.,5
5 stars,5
Awesome,5
Rawr,5
"I'd say it's like CoC, but with a different theme. You might like it",5
Excellent free game. Great detail and graphics,5
Very challenging.,5
Very good game,5
Just started and cant put it down. Too awesome!!!!,5
Eggcelent,5
Cool,5
Good game.. and funny,5
Kinda different than the others but its also what I like about,5
Good fun,5
Give it a shot! Cool story line too.,5
Fun,5
Very fun,5
I love this game. Memories,5
Ridicules amount of fun haha.,5
Best game stratagey game ever,5
Fu ck yeah,5
Fun,4
I just started playing and it somewhat feels like class of clans but it is a bit different. If you like COC you should try this game,5
Love it,5
Awesome,5
Just as fun as the old pc game just bummer it's set up for transactions,5
Great,5
"But they let you play all the way through the tutorial before dropping the EULA on you. It's a shame, because it seemed like it fun game otherwise.",1
Like it.,5
I got addicted to this immediately!   Really fun!,5
This game killed itself just to make an extra buck. F* you EA.,1
"This game has a lot to offer along side other tower defense games, especially like the tunnel system for creating bottle neck traps. Gonna be putting some time into this awesome game",5
Game is pretty dang awesome!,5
Love this game so much,5
Brings back old gaming memories!!!,5
If why other people are having troubles but it works fine for me and its a great game  so hopefully it'll be fixed for those other people,5
Fun,5
It's okay. I'd much rather have a port of the old PC game than just one more micro-trans grindfest.,2
A really fun and entertaining game. I can't stop playing it reminds me of dwarves on steam but funnier,5
Entertaining,5
Yup,5
"So if you have ever played any web game that slowly gives you resources or turns over time, you have already played this game. Micro transactions speed things along, but why bother when there are plenty of other games to play that were designed better and show their true costs up front. This could have been a good dungeon keeper game, but they decided to try and fleece casual gamers for easy money.",1
Played for a bit and I enjoyed it.,5
Awesome game well Balanced,5
Fun,5
I like it,5
Sweet game,5
Bad               Bad,1
Finally a mobile strategy game that I don't need to pay to get the real experience.,5
"Good interface, great gameplay.",5
Yup,5
Fun,5
Been waiting for this,5
"Great game no real problems, could run off less RAM but 4 stars for gameplay and gameplot",4
Good game,4
"Not quite the originl dungeon keeper, but some of the soul and spirit is still there, amongst the silly time managment elements.",5
Just like the PSP games dungeon maker. I loved those games. Now if you could reduce build times!!!!!,5
Classic gameplay updated with social interactions.,5
Said i had a patch error. Uninstalled then Reinstalled. Works fine.. For now.. Great game i want to see make it. Fix this ill rate 5,2
Addictive,5
The game play is great and the mechanics of the game is great. Keep up the good work	The game play is great and the mechanics of the game is great. I am starting to wonder about there next game.,5
So far so good,5
"If you played the old dungeon keepers,  this will just make you sad.",1
Just like the old pc version but with mobile game graphics,5
"This game is a lot of fun. Easy to learn, takes time like most games but enjoyable never the less.",5
Awesome,5
Fun,5
Cool game,5
Awesome,5
This game is good.,5
Good game,5
Its awesome,5
Just like the pc version all the years ago,5
"Nice change of pace from Jungle Heat and other build and attack games. Very comical too... Just try it, the price is right. Can't go better than free.",5
Enjoyable so far...,5
Awesome gameplay,5
"Dungeons and dragons, but on the dungeon master side. Not too shabby",5
Yo,5
I can't believe this is on my phone. Best PC game and now best smart phone game. Well done.,5
Interesting game,5
Need to be like clash of clans,5
Great,5
"I remember this game back from the day loved it then and apparently still do... Hate they want u to spend real money but what game doesn't these days... Fun tho, must see",5
Best defense game out thereand I love the graphics.,5
Bad,1
Uhhh ditto,5
Another pay to win,1
Great,5
Just don't!,1
"I will give a better rating once I actually play it but I'm so excited. My dad gave me the PC version of this game years ago and my mother lost it when she confiscated it for being ""too mature""",3
I still prefer the old Bullfrog games though.,5
"A modern spin on a really great classic. Makes me want to dig out my old CD of this game, install it, and play like crazy!",5
Great game,5
I grew up with this game ea needs to bring it back to pc,5
Once I start I can't seem to stop...like one of them games.,5
Thanks EA for ruining a classic...  Just another pay to progress type phone game that runs poorly at that.  I was so excited to play this game until i realized it takes 4 hours to dig out just one block of wall unless i want to use up all of my gems and start paying real money to actually play the game as it should be played.  Don't waste your time with this one...,1
Good,5
This a very fun game,5
Fun game,5
Freaking awesome game brings back memories of the old school Dungeon Keeper,5
Good graphics,4
Very addicting and fun bring out the inner evil,5
Boss,5

Played the original and am loving this new phone version,5
Like the dark Clash of Clans,5
Played the old computer game forever. Love this one!,5
Cool fun,5
Played through tutorial and was immediately nailed by 4+ hour wait times.,1

Love playing,5
Plays well good graphics and seems fun,5
Just amazing for this type of game. I love it!,5
One of the worst games ever,1
I love it,4
Used to be a great PC game many years ago. Now it looks to be tedious drivel. All the fun of this once great game appears to have been tortured into nonexistence. Oh well.,1
It keeps freezing i play for a minute and freezes somtimes it even freezes when its at the load screen for the game if yall fix i would play  i played the computer versions all the time plzz fix,1
Fun game brings back memories of my DK days on computers shame theres no PC version of this or somthin similer,5
The original on cp so many years ago. thank you so much EA !!!!!!,5
Yn,5
"Its just bad, no further comment.",1
Awesome!!!!!!!!!,5
Entertaining,5
Good,5
Could be good???crashes every couple of minutes,1
Good game.,4
Very interesting,5
Great game,5
Awsom,5
This game is great and i only just started playing it today! I've played tons of games like this and by far,5
fun,5
Great game,5
Thanks to your team.,5
"I miss the people game, but this will do",5
I loved the original dungeon keeper but now i hate ea for doing what they did	No more micro transaction I hate games with micro transaction that's why I'll never play this game again,1
I had dungeon keeper 2 gold edition for PC  and this brings back memories you guys really did an amazing job no lag or problems for me keep up the good work,5
Having fun so far,5
Awsome,5
I remember playing this long time ago. Great game,5
Kind of like clash of clans but a lot of fun and a different take with the defense route nice job!!,5
Would give the game five stars good game but it laggs so much even when there isint allot going on needs the bugs to be fixed,1
Loved it on PC. Digging it on droid!,5
Not as good as the original but I guess they would need to change a few of the mechanics to make a profit off of it. Otherwise this is really fun I like it better than most village building game.,5
Works great and really fun!,5
an Android port. Decent graphics. Easy enough to pick up and play - personally not a fan of games that require 4 hours to wait for anything without spending a currency that is based on real money (but it _is_ EA after all). All in all this is one of the better EA Android games.,5
Get it,5
Nostalgiarific,5
Sup,5
Awesome,5
Its just like clash of clans but cooler,5
"If you are a fan of the Bullfrog studio Dungeon Keeper series, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SHABBY PERVERSION. Utter filth compared to the great god game that was DK and DKII.",1
Like this game alot,5
Awsome,5
Addictive,5
"Great game so far, very funy, polished, no bugs.",5
Ruins a good game,1
Mhm,5
Fun to play,5
"This game has the potential of being an amazing game, but every time I play, it says Error Code 7. Please fix.",1
Loved this when I was younger. I like this too.,5
Yes,5
"Fun game,  great graphics",5
This was one of my favorite games.  I am excited to see EA give it a reincarnation,5
Remnds me so much of the hours I used to spend playing this on the computer,5
"There was alot more control on the pc game. You could direct your minions a little more, but this is still a great game",5
I love these type of games. This one is worth playing.,5
Worth it,5
wont work just like most people,1
I had a lot of fun,5
Why fun game. Great to play when feeling board or mAke the time go by.,5
"Possibly ""smart"" move of EA to force people into paying for the gems.  Nut sure.  But without the microtransactions (which are not really micro,  but quite contrary quite expensive) you will wait one day to remove one square of stone.  Started to be bored after 6 hours.  I want a game that is fun to play as the original DK used to be! Uninstalling...",1
Great always liked these games.,5
Fun,5
A great update to an old classic,5
"Work fine after first update. A bit long for tutorial if you dont pay with gem, but nothing to go crazy abouth.	See for yourself , enjoyable game.",5
"Great idea, poorly executed... You can't go 10 minutes without being forced to pay large amounts of money to play. Not worth the time or money",1
Great game!,5
Better then barbarian raid games no names of course,5
Great,5
I hate waiting,4
Fun,5
Best game ever,5
Great game sofar just started though,5
Fun,5
You guys should make it so you can have more thin one imp working on one thin so it donst take so long to dig or make things like work shops,5
It's good,5
Cant stop playing,5
Playing it and the graphic are awesome,5
Kewl fun,5
It is cool,5
Very fun addictive I love it,5
It's alot like clash of clans but better,5
I loved the original and it's great to have in on a mobile platform. Great game,5
I loved the original. This game has been changed to accommodate the mobile generation. Not bad bad for the first try out the door. Imps are a bit expensive since they alone allow for dungeon growth. I cannot wait to grow larger.,5
Nic3,5
Real fun,5
"The type of people who design a game that locks you out of playing unless you pay, have a special level of hell carved out just for them. Microtransactions are fine, but should only be used to enhance the game play, not be an integral part that ALLOWS you to play a game. Dont bother with this BS. DON'T give these crooks your money to keep funding this type of robbery.",1
Great game,5
Pretty cool. Wish dungeons could be bigger,4
"Nice little game.  Wish it moved a tad quicker, but overall i like it.",5
This  Isna fail of a game,1
Simple time killer game just started so nothing negative,5
Epic,5
"Amazing game, and plays well on my Galaxy S4 Mini!",5
"Fluent, new and has me wanting to do more",5
Its a great game ! But lags a bit,5
"Fu, addictive, and looks good.",5
"Not as good as the original game, but a decent diversion.",5
"I played the first two games on pc back in the day and I quite enjoyed them. This game is a good follow up to a unique series, very funny with engrossing game play. Totally worth playing, wheather u want to spend money or not.",5
Can't get enough of this game,5
Awesome,5
Very cool. Graphics are nice,5
Fun.,5
I mean sum stuff take 24hours to kill a block or something,1
(=,5
Fun,5
Good,5
Great game !!,5

Not bad!,5
Cool,5
Awesome strategic game!,5
It would be nice to play the real dungeon keeper again.....such good times,4
Fun,5
Awesome,5
DK is still my all-time fave. This is an awesome new version!,5
This just isn't as enjoyable as the one Bullfrog made on PC years ago. Actually I'm going to go play it right now.,2
"Great game, easy to play",5
I enjoy playing this a lot,5
Looks like I'm going to be up all night playing again!,5
Can't put it down love the reverse of the tower defense makes strategies a lot harder because u have to plan ur layout for offensive as well as defense great time killer,5
Great combo of tower defense and assualt. Love to plunder!,5
This is an awesome game.,5
BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!,5
Ok,5
Super fun!,5
Fun game,5
Love the concept!,5
Cool but freezes alot,5
Great,5
Nostalgia reigns... I am so happy.,5
Great game love it better then clash of clans smhh:p,5
Play it,5
I like it I was kinda getting bored of Clash of Clans pretty fun and addictive,5
I've had it on the computer for a while and this one has better graphics and I don't have to sit on my computer to play,5
Addictif,5
Seems nice. Thinking I might grab full version.,5
Just like clash of clans but better,5
When i play it after a minute or so my phone reboots,3
"Kinda confusing I felt at first, but hey, once I got it down, wow. Just addicting and tine consuming. Thanks",5
It reminds me of Dungeons the PC game.,5
You have earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $9.99 each.,1
Awesome game. Played the original when I was younger.,5
I got it to work but usaly it cuts off every 15 min plz fix p.s delete,2
I  like,5
So awesome!,5
So littered by micro transactions that the game is actually unplayable... Sickening to think that they would do this to such a great franchise.,1
I really cannot rate this game high enough! Its amazing and addictive,5
I really am enjoying this game  its full of excitement and dungeon raids,5
"Great graphics, sounds, and all around best game I played so far on my phone!!",5
A great game and really brings back memories of dungeon keeper for pc,5
Highly recommend it,5
Played on PC and other networks but this time it's a lot better all around. Could use more chances for premium content and other exclusive things. Otherwise it's a great game! Well done!,4
Good game!,5
This game is great,5
Pretty good.,4
good game,5
"Entertaining, great graphic, dead chickens... The",5
Fun,5
"Cute and fun.  Good graphics.  Takes a little while to get the hang of it, but worth learning.",5
Cool so far. Addictive.,5
So far so good. :),5
Loved the originals its nice to be able to play them again,5
Even better than it used to be.,5
I remember this game on old school pc and it still holds up,5
Awesome,5
It can't be bad,5
Its a good game so far. Pretty fun,5
Great,5
Str8 dope son!,5
New to game but fun so far.,5
"You have ruined a classic. Real time strategy.. it's supposed to be real time, not whatever the hell this is. I feel worse for your developers that probably have to cry themselves to sleep knowing their hard work was just wasted on this garbage in app strategy.",1
I never thought anything could beat clash of clans...... This app proved me wrong,5
So much fun.  Nicely done!,5
this game is a ripoff.,1
Dh as tefhfcj eek last.  Seec last.   is      to.  lOO.   are not be a lot to see you can you can get it is the new one is a lot of this message is,5
Well done EA,5
Fun game,5
An amazing game and I've only just begun.,5
Epic,5
Nostalgia,5
It is a great game but... jk I love it!!!!!!,5
I really like the concept and the fact that it has no freaking bugs,5
Really fun to play.,5
"I don't mind paying a fair price for a game.  I like free demos and then paying to unlock or download a full copy.  At any rate, when I download a game, I expect to be able to play it.  Then they're this turkey.    I don't expect Facebook style do-something-today, check-back-tomorrow gaming from a downloaded game.  Well, without throwing real money repeatedly at the game that is...  Bottom line, avoid this at all costs.",1
This app will leave you satisfied and have you coming back for more.,5
Pppp,5
Old school style with great sense of humor.,5
Best game must play!,5
Great game,5
"IAPs are overwhelming, the timers are ridiculous.. A 4 day wait - seriously? I'd have paid real money for this classic spin on dungeons, but not for this obvious click the cow ripoff.",1
Not to shabby.,4
Great,5
This is just crazy and has not much to do with classic DK. It is pure pay to win or grind and wait.,1
Verry good,5
Fun game all around,5
I Very fjn,5
Nice game,5
Its slow downloading but overall its a great game.,5
Addicting,5
Love it,5
"Does not even deserve 1 star, are you kidding me 120$ in app purchases, I am insulted.",1
Lots of fun,5
Adicting,5
Gr8 game,5
Its really good.,5
Fun,5
I like it,5
"Micro transactions are horrible. Sure, they make tons of money for the developers, but they ruin games. This game would be okay if it didn't take a whole day to mine a section without paying tons of money. Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 were good games, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE MIRCO TRANSACTIONS. EA, please stop ruining games by doing this.",1
Awesome game,5
A potentially fun game absolutely ruined by expensive microtransactions.,1
Awesome game amazing twist on an original game.,5
This game is actually pretty cool,5
Nice take on these castle raid type games!,5
"The game loads to 90% before saying error code 7. My end is flawless, so fix it for a real review.",1
This game brings back so many memories of playing the original dungeon keeper on pc years ago. It's not quite the same but it gets 4 stars for the nostalgia. It's a decent time waster but it's just another in game purchase trip.,4
Good,5
Good start so far...,5
So far so good,5
Awesome,5
"I remember this game when it first came out. It was addictive then, and is especially so now! I can take it wherever I am now which makes it that much better!",5
Awesome,5
Cool,3
Cool,5
Awesome game,5
Game is a money pit. EA destroying good games for decades. Don't even try it. Garbage!,1
great,5
Gaining resources is really really slow. Enough for me to uninstall.,2
guess wat day it is guess wat day it is HUMP DAY YEAH,5
"Incredible mobile experience, if you aren't playing, you are missing out on something amazing!",5
cool so far,4
Good game to burn time,5
badass game,5
Starts slow but when you pass the tutorial it becomes epic,5
Good for killing time lol,5
Money grabbing devil wants you to use gems with real cash.  Pops up constantly.  I don't know the purpose of the game because it just seems like it's about waiting or spending gems,1
Fun,5
Great game,5
Your dungeon is full of yogurt.,5
Excellent K,5
It's pretty good,5
No Comment,5
Wonderfully fun,5
"Was managing well enough, but when I switched to send a text and back, no longer runs!",1

This is almost like the dungeon keeper I used to play on the computer,5
"i woulf give this game a better rating of i could actually play it. since downloading it onto my phone, it keeps showing error code7.",1
Very funny game,5
I love it,5
Congratulations EA you have earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for 2.99 or get all 5 for 69.99 (best value!),1
Excellent game. I loved this game on the PC.,5
Awesome,5
This is the reason micro transactions are hated so much,1
Awesome game,5
Wow will be playing this for awile,5
Good fun very inventive,5
Great,5
Yay,5
Cool,5
EA turns yet another classic from my childhood into a petty cash grab.  F2P can work; unfortunately this game misses that mark by a country mile.,1
An amazing classic returns.... Good looking,5
I cant stop play this game.,5
"Love the old PC games, this is pretty close to the original.",5
Crazy fun,5
"Even without playing it, unless it sucks (which I doubt), this is one of the best games ever created. \m/",5
"Its new but still keeps the old themes and such. Its really cool seeing wut theyve done with the game and it is truly, awesome",5
Very funny,5
Always liked this game,4
Fun Entertainment.,5
I love this game. So reminiscent of the old Dungeon Keeper games.,5
I love this game.  It's based on the clash of clans but has better tactics possibilities.,5
"Great job,EA",5
Needs to be like pc open world version I was very excited to see one of my favorite games of all time come to mobile thank you Enough I thought you had abandoned the title completely,3
"I loved the pc game and this is a great adaptation, GREAT JOB!!!",5
I remember this game for pc it was amazing this has some different aspects but fun,5
Great,5
Freemium nonsense,1
I remember the old Dungeon Keepers...love this game,5
"Nothing like the original one, my only problem is that the space takes too long to mine out and IS TO SMALL",3
So addicting love it great game,5
Just awesome!!!,5
Everything about it is average,3
"The playability of this game is about 30 seconds at a time, then put it down for several hours; and repeat ad infinitum.  That is unless you want to drop between  $5 and $100 to speed it up..  ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.  Beyond ridiculous.",1
Grrrreat game,5
Like the style of play,4
Really fun,5
Excellent,5
Reminds me of the good ol days on pc,5
I love this game,5
Ive waited for this sence the 2nd DK and I still cant belive its finaly here!!!!!,5
LOL GG,5
"No it's not a perfect replica of the game we all knew and loved, but for an ap I'm pretty happy with the game. Haven't run into huge problems yet, though I wish resources were easier to obtain. Ah well. Just gimme more imps to smack around...",5
"Free!  What's better than free?  Nothing!  But if you want to enjoy this game it can cost you $100s of dollars.  Or, you can buy the original Good Old Game to play on your computer for only $6 with no game killing in app purchases.  Party on EA!",1
Good but slow,4
Fantastic have t played dk in years glad to see a version for tablets,5
Swell,5
Best game thus far,5
Cool,5
Love this game,5
So fun!!!!!!!,5
"This game requires a lot of microtransactions to play, and it really has no reason to be called Dungeon Keeper. Avoid avoid avoid.",1
Fun,5
Pretty decent game....I havent had any problems with it.,5
K,5
the best game I ever played :-) :-) :-) :-),5
Good game,5
Play it often,5
This gaame is great,5
Good so far,4
Hooked can't stop playing,5
Awesome,5
Awesome game,5
Fun game,5
Very addictive and fun game. You have to dedicate some time to it and have patience.,5
Absolutely love it :D,5
"I remember when seeing the EA logo used to mean awesome games, but the last couple have had major issues. I have a brand new top off the line phone with 4g and fast wifi and this game still doesn't connect. DK used to be one of the most fun and addicting games but I can't even play this one. Of course DK back in the day had huge amounts of bugs and glitches. You can play the original for free through game tap.",1
I'm having a lot of fun being evil!!! HELL YEAH!!!,5
Reminds me of the old PC version lol,5
Usually youre always raiding dungeons in games but this time you make one and defend it,5
I have been waiting for a this game to be on android,5
"Dungeon Keeper is SUPPOSED to be a real time strategy game, not a ""wait 24 hours for something that should be immediate"" type of game. Building takes real time. In order to speed up the building you have to buy - you guessed it - MICRO-TRANSATIONS. Which cost a stupid amount of money. 1.50 so expedite a SINGLE TILE from taking 24 hours.  JUST GIVE US A 20 DOLLAR ONE TIME PURCHASE OPTION WITH NO MICRO-TRANSATIONS. Then I might actually play this. Until then, stay way, way clear.",1
it's awesome!,5
"As much as I love the IP as it brings much nostalgia, games pay to win hard. Hard dry with no lube. GG",3
Love it!  Played the original back in 2000 or so....still lots of fun. Wish I could make more imps quickly,5
"No issues so far...kinda seems like a knock off of clash of clans, but I like the differences.",5
Uninstalled,1
Been looking for something like this since playing Dungeon Overlord on Facebook.,5
Yosome,5
24 hours to destroy one block or 1.50...,1
"Love this game as good as the frist, almost as good as DK2",5
"Very well laid out, Dungeon Keeper translates extremely well to touch devices, and f2p as well. EA has been ruling the mobile scene. Great job!",5
"Once had this for pc. I don't like that there were ""gems"" brought into the mix but it's still a fun game. Could also use without the timers, I don't remember that being in DK.",4
Good game,5
Awesome.,5
I remember this game from way back gg,5
This game is amazing. And the host sounds like tim curry.,5
Yay,5
Addicted already,5
Generally fun,5
"So far I am enjoying the gameplay. I own all of the dungeon games on computer, and am hoping this will be as fun. I also hope to see multiplayer cooperative features in this game, because I only enjoy games when I can share the fun with friends and family. I will re-rate them game in the near future as I progress, and or when new updates arrive. Again I hope more cooperative features are implemented, which I cannot stress enough.",5
I like it its a different take on tower defense the developers did a good job with this one its pretty fun and dialogue is funny if you like being the bad guy this game is for you,5
Awesome game,5
No bugs or nothing Good RPG as well,5
Alway loved this game,5
"I just happened to check this game out by chance, glad I did. Plays excellently on my LG G2",5
StupiID!!!!!!!!,5
Tons o Funs,5
Exactly what i have been looking for,5
Lots of fun  could be a bit faster,5
I had the old game for the pc and am so happy it is on android.,5
Tons of fun,5
Fun buff saif,5
Awesome,5
Love it,5
Great game,5
Asume,5
Lots of fun!,5
I love this game it reminded me of overlord,5
How hard would it be to bring classic dk back... I'll pass on this ea thanks anyways.,1
Fun,5
"EA ruined the name. Another one of those ""wait for 10 days for something to build"" game. To get anywhere in the game you will need to spend lots of real money.",1
Pay to win model as always.  Screw you EA,1
Very fun,5
Different and addictive,5
Good one!,5
Play it every day,5
Interesting concept,5
A day to mine a block...,1
Fun game so far,5
Nice to go back and pay around with Horny,5
f****** microtransactions,1
Great game,5
Time killer taking getting used to compared to pc version,5
Great game,5
Lots of fun,5
Good,5
This game used to be fun id rather have the original game style at the cost of purchasing the app instead of in game purchases... sadly its too expensive and time consuming for it to be much fun....800 gems just for a imp is really stupid.   EA ruined a great game.  Oh but thats EA for you greedy greedy.,3
Great reamaging of the original,5
Great,5
Reminds me of the good days!,5
I love this game!,5
Excellent game was on computer before the tablet but awesome job converting the game,5
Awesome,5
Fun and occupying!,5
"I used to spend hours playing the original games, and this version, while very different, is just as much fun as I remember the originals being",5
Awesome with a touch of the classic DK,5
Better then most game!!!,5
So amazing,5
The only real problem that I have with the game is the time it takes to mine gems.,4
"It's fun, but laggy at times with freezes",4
Awesome,5
Fun and awsome,5
Great brah,5
Fun game so far,5
"This game is really fun you can do so much, even slap your workers (imps) to speed them up!",5
Amazing,5
Fun times...wish I could get more gems though.,5
Action,5
Imps are boss,5
Fun game,5
Great game,5
Cool game hope they make another,5
Awesome game!!!!,5
Good,5
Sweet game,5
Same great game and its free,5
Very entertaining!,5
Great graphics and playability,5
"After downloading the app and updates for two and a half hours, I expected to play an awesome game. I tried numerous times to load the game, but I repeatedly got the error for code seven. Please fix this in an update soon. I have loved many EA games and this honestly disappoints me. Please fix asap. I give you two stars because I still have hope in this. As soon as it starts playing on my phone, I will give you a proper and worthy rating.",2
Cool game remember it from the pc,5
"I'm not waiting 4-24 hours for an imp to dig one sodding square. Nor am I paying real money to make the game move along at a reasonable rate.  Ea seems to have forgotten how dungeon keeper 1 and 2 worked. Then thought ""how do we make tons of money on it""  Also requires a constant internet connection to play. No signal? No game.",1
Cool game old PC game,5
I totally agree awesome game,5
Requires G+ and see all my friends just to boot the game? Nope.,2
Lot of fun:-),5
"Controls are glitchy, takes a long time to load. Game play is slowed to a crawl mostly waiting for resources to load in order to convince you to buy gems. Storyline asks you to buy gems constantly. Unless you'd like to spend enough money to buy a dozen other games on microtransactions, don't bother downloading.",2
"Awesome on my Samsunggalaxy tab 2 7""",5
So cool,5
Fun an entertaining,5
J,5
Hi,5
Just as good as the one that came out way long ago,5
I am already addicted and just downloaded it.  Great job EA!!!,5
Very fun,5
"This is a really great game, the way the creatures look are weird to me, but everything else is fantastic",5
Thanks,5
Very well put together,5
What a epic way to destroy a classic game memory. Too much emphasis placed on in game purchases EA ! Congrats you have tainted a gaming memory with this new uncreative trash . For future reference do not take a classic loved old game and try to turn it into micro transaction hell. I would have paid a fair onetime price for the game if you were not trying to squeeze every action in said game into a transaction nightmare.,1
"Let's see how annoying the timers get.  Already got a 4 hour timer 6 minutes into the game.  Yeah, the timers man...",4
Cheap Clash of Clans clone. No resemblance to it's namesake at all! Also very expensive (like Clash) if you don't want to wait hours for anything to progress. Avoid this unless they adjust pricing drastically.,2
"Great concept, ease of use is fantastic",5
I love this game!!!! If it's anything like the pc game I'm sold.,5
Fun,5
Awesome so much like clash of clans...get it,5
Addictive from the start.,5
Almost exactly how I remember the pc version. .,5
Awsome,5
Fun,5
I love the interactive voice and the gameplay is great! Keep the updates coming.,5
Haven't tried the online features yet but the main game seems well built	Great game,4
Interesting and very entertai.ing,5
It's ok,4
Good game,5
It is so fun to play.,5
"While the game itself is decent enough it only uses the similar theme of dungeon keeper and that's about it. It plays very similarly to Clash of Clans, except not nearly as well. Overall the game is just disappointing.",3
Great game,5
Fun game,5
This game looked like high ugh quality so I assumed it would be slow. It's rather the opposite! The comic book type style and awesome devil commentary makes this game tremendous!,5
Its so much fun I love playing it :),5
Sweet,5
For it to b a time waiting game its pretty good. U all should make a commercial just like the others,4
"This is a cool game especially because of the traps. But is obviously a clash of clans copy. Overall, cool",3
Ok,5
Loved the old pc version. Great job development team.,5
Good,5
Awesome,5
great game,5
Good,5
Very good,5
"Fun so far, great for nostalgia.",5
Play it!!!!,5
Kills my battery but oh do I not regret it,5
Great game but I could do with out the micro transaction,5
Awesome,5
Kills time and enjoy playing it I would recommend this to my friends,5
I have just started this game but so far so good,5
"Love it. Wish game play was closer to the comp version, but still an amzing fun game",5
Fun,5
Just like clash of clans! Super fun!,5
"I had the original game on my OLD PC years ago, ran slow. But on my Nexus 7 (2013) it runs as smooth as burning oil!",5
Love this game being able to build my own dungeon is lots of fun!!!,5
Great way to pass time. Very similar to the old version for pc. Always was a good game.,5
Loved it!,5
Good game with fun mechanic's. Unique and reminds me of an old computer game.,5
Great for killing time,5
It  is s good to  me it mite be good for you,4
Great game a little buggy but its great just fix the problem with the health bar not showing on raiding I'll rate 5,5
"great game cool graphic.great sounds, love it",5
Love it!,5
A lot of fun so far great waste of time,5
The fact that I have to wait 24hour for one wall to break is sickening,1
If you ever played the original on pc you will love this!,5
Cool,5
I really like the game it fun definitely worthy of 5 stars,5
I like it,5
I loved dungeon keeper 2. This feels like a way to cash in on the dk fanboys. Shame on you ea. The game worked but it isn't dungeon keeper we all know ane love.,1
Apologies for eneyone stupid enough to throw money at this game go play the original for 5$,1
Amazing,5
Runs very nice on my phone. Love that I get to slap my imps!!!!,5
New spin on an old favorite! I've found my new time waster :),5
Love the game.,5
Only gave r stars because it must be played online. Maybe they could make it where you only need online when doing pvp.,4
A new devilish twist in strategy! üëø,5
Same concept as most other tap and wait games definently a pay to win too but cool concept and cool time killer.,4
Awesome,5
Lol kooky,5
Game,5
:-),5
Wish rooms expanded like pc version but.. they gotta make money somehow.,5
Good,5
"I really wish this was more like DK2, but I'm just happy to be smacking imps again.",5
Its nice,5
Fun,5
A childhood favorite reborn!,5
I kind of didn't want to rate it because I didn't want to stop playing. It deserves more downloads. Better than your average dungeon defending game.,5
Awesome,5
Good fun,5
Just another wait forever for things to get build game. I am sad that they are using Dungeon Keeper name for this boring game. The old P C Dungeon Keeper is ten times better then this.,1
"I was really excited to see Dungeon Keeper on my phone. I really loved playing the original version of this game. The micro-transactions however, make this game absolutely unplayable and ridiculous. Don't let the tutorial fool you. This is not worth a download.",1
:-),5
Spent hours when owned by bullfrog. Wish they would come out with a console or update version,5
Rock out with your socks out,5
Kool game,5
Its not bad,5
Way cooool,5
Loving it,5
"Good game, easy to play. More involved than many similar games.",5
Fun,5
Would love to play but never gets past 90% load and tells me message 7 error.,1
Just like warcraft,5
That's about it.,5
Evil and cool,5
Fun so far,5
Having all kinds of monster is good much more will be great,4
"I used to enjoy this game for years then it kinda faded away after it stopped being compatible with my pc.  It is missing a few of the tricks and such butnit is still a solid enjoyable game that bring back dark, dank and shiney dungeony memories :)",5
Love the game its a great game to play during your free time,5
Basically I get to be the villain for once...again.,5
A must play,5
This game is a crying shame as to a Dungeon Keeper game. Save your money and buy the original from GoG.,1
It freaking rocks,5
Very addi..... gotta go,5
Great game so far.,5
Not like the old one but for being a mobile version its great,5
Awesome,5
very good,5
Loved this game when I was younger and its still fun,5
"Man this game is almost as good as it's original computer version, but it's still worthy of top rating",5
Love it,5
It's like dungeon keeper but wastes more time,5
"I used to play this game on my pc, and I loved it. Looking forward to more options with raids, etc.",5
Evil!!!,5
Awsome,5
Don't take as long as Clash of Clans,5
Yea.,5
This is ridiculous.,1
Lots o fun,5
I haven't had the game that long but it is a lot of fun so far,5
"If you liked the first or second game, play those and stay away from this micro transaction Sim",1
Fun and addicting!,5
Almost like the original for PC.,5
Fun even if you don't spend money on it. I recommend.,5
Nicegame but u have to read the instructions first dont do  the next next next,5
Good game,5
Very polished and keeps with the charm of the original. Nice work Mythic,5
"This micro-transaction stuff needs to stop.  And this is the ABSOLUTE WORST I've ever seen it.  STOP!  All of you.  I would rather pay 5 dollars for a game that I can play unhindered than have to pay for EVERY little thing I do in a game.  This is unacceptable.  And for every one of you who actually PAYS money for these micro-transactions,  you are making it worse, by saying this behaviour is ok.    IT IS NOT!  STOP making games with micro-transactions, you are DESTROYING the world of gaming.  1 Star, and great big F-U!",1
Fun,5
Excellent graphics and fun to play,5
Must play.,5
Love this app game play is smooth.,5
"It's nice to be playing Dungeon Keeper again, but it sucks that it's made in this model again.",3
Love this game,5
Don't think twice about downloading this game. EA always delivers,5
Bout time!,5
Simple strategy with lots of charm. Fun way to pass the time.,5
Gg,5
Better than the rest. Period.,5
Awesome,4
Just started already love it :),5
I like the game. Fun and the graphics are a lot better then i thought.,5
Sweet,5
"Certain things take a while, and the only way to speed things up is with gems, main way to get those is micro-transactions. Other than that, fair game. I prefer the pc version.",4
Great game I remember playing on PC. Graphics in this one are more cartoony and the voice isn't the same but its still a great game!,5
Oh.,3
Definetely worthy of all 5. Sick.,5
"Good, diabolical fun.",5
Hi it's good,5
Loved it before and now‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï,5
This is a very good game but breaking down the rocks 2 get 2 the gold and rock producer stuff takes too long,5
Must try,5
Fun minion play,5
Much better than greed for glory. I love the mix of tower defense and a rts.,5
Ive played clash of clans and other games like it and i have to say i am really entertained with this game its funny and brings a wicked style to these types of games,5
Yay,5
Love it!,5
I love this game...by far the best mobile game I've played in a long time...,5
The game is really fun,5
"I used to play this over a decade ago and it's somewhat different than it used to be,  but it's still addictive as hell! Love this game!!!!!!",5
Fun game,5
Awesome. I've been waiting for a new dungeon keeper game!,5
Kinda like the old pc game. Except not as much control. Still great!,5
Pretty fun,5
"It's better than the original,",1
I like the spin on tower defence,5
Fun and funny. No game is better if you can't turn things into chickens and squash them haha,5
Great,5
Fun,5
Takes days to progress without purchasing their real money in game currency. Don't waste your time on a game you can't even play.,1
Very addictive fun game .,5
Its really fun and easy to get into,5
"I played the original PC dungeon keeper so this like walking down ""hellish"" memory lane",5
Love everything about this game and the humor is pretty funny too!  But the major thing is you really don't need to buy anything with money,5
Pay wall in this game is horrendous.,1
Fun,5
Dungeon Keeper is back!,5
"This game is different, but holds the same concept as strategy games like Clash of Clans. I love it! Recommend for sure! Get the game!",5
Jet cool,5
Loved to old pc version of this. Hope thos continues to be just as good as the old one,5
Seems good,4
"Have only played for a Little bit, but I like it so far. The only down sides are it has to have an Internet connection to play, there is no offline like say to build up your dungeon and it take so long to get through some of the dig squares its tempting to use your limited gems need for more workers",5
Fun,5
I hope it proves as fun as the old one,5
Great game,5
Epic,5
Possibly better than the original!,5
Reminds of my old game when it was owned by bullfrog!!! Love it!!,5
Fun,5
Funny demon,5
Funny game,5
This game so fun! Every one should download this!,5
I feel bad to the bone,5
Dungeon keeper is awesome I love playing this on PC back in the day also dungeon keeper 2,5
Cool,5
Good,5
Fun game,5
This game is great the only bad thing is that you have to wait for things to happen you don't need to wait if you pay that's the only catch but the gameplay is great,5
Awesomely dark game!,5
Cool,5
Ye,5
Fun,5
Fun,5
Already addicted to it. Happy that you gett to start out with enough gems.,5
I used to play this game for pc a long time ago and i can say that it is definitely worth downloading this game.,5
Fun times!,5
I'm having a lot of fun playing this game. It's simple to learn how to play and it's addictive.,5
Fun,5
"Google, please stop allowing ""Pay To Win"" (Pay To Cheat, actually) games.  Didn't you say ""do no evil""?  Well, PTC games ARE evil, pure evil, like crack cocaine Evil.  Please listen to us Google, please?",1
Game stops at a certain point with in app purchases,1
A different mixture of defense and city building.  Liking it so far.,5
Its nice to be on the other side of the story. We always have to plunder dungeons now we can build our own.,5
Amazing :-D,5
The game I love now on my phone :-),5
"I'm a fan of the originals - if that's what you're expecting, you may not enjoy this.  It's a decent translation to the free app model.  If you're prepared for that and can adapt to the timers, you'll be OK.  I would still prefer to shell out $20-30 for a straight up single player update of the game, but I can make do with this. For what it to s, it's well done.",5
Dungeon Keeper has always been a great blast from the past. I'm very excited about a mobile version!,5
Pretty blatant rip off of clash mechanics using dungeon keeper art style. Seems like a fun idea but paying for something that disappears never works. Find something permanent for me to buy or just stop!,2
This reminds me of the old school dungeon keeper for pc. I am really liking this,5
Charming tower defense game with an evil twist. A lot of fun to be had here. Just getting started and I'm already hooked.,5
"I loved Dungeon Keeper when I played it long ago.Although this new approach is unusual, it's actually a good F2P game. You don't really need to Pay 2 Win.",5
Awesomely,5
Addictive and fun,5
But so far its pretty cool. Plus the bigass screen on the note helps.,5
A great game to kill some time.,5
This Is a fun game.,5
Awesome game :),5
Great,5
Fun game,5
I almost forgot about Dungeon Keeper.,5
Just make us pay for a good gane instead of designing a crappy game purely based on microtransactions... ea sucks so bad,1
Buy this game it is awsome and amazing,5
Fun game get it,5
"Very good game, but more games need to be made without such a long wait time on building, we have lives and we just wanna play the game right then and there not have to wait so long",5
Awesome game,5
EA paid for them,1
Freaking awesome n the dialog cracks me up lmao,5
I used to play it all the time on the comp great to have it back,5
Interesting,5
Awesome time playing this,5
This game is so much fun and addicting,5
I like it.  Not a fan of in game cash shops but I just ignore them.,5
Good game just wish you didn't have to wait so long to build / research everything,5
Loved this game back in the day,5
Interesting,5
Khoob,5
Much like dungeon keeper on the pc,5
Said comment,5
Reminds me of a mix of the original and mighty quest for epic loot,5
"Played once and afterwards it started spamming my notification bar trying to get me to play more. Go fly a kite, EA. Uninstalled.",1
:-),5
Deliciously different. Though I would have preferred to be an angel. Oh well.,5
Glad this game came to mobile,5
Wonderful game,5
Fun game,5
Great game so far!,5
Dis right here is my jam.,5
Love the nostalgia,5
"Considering this is from EA (a company that, in my opinion, usually ruins IPs and overstocks the Android store with sub par products), this is actually quite a fun game. Minus the in-app purchases, this game manager to keep me interested and have fun for quite some time before I get bored.",5
Yea ok,5
A different approach and very entertaining,5
Very entertaining and smooth on my moto x,5
Not the original but still fun,5
"Just a pretty clash clone... Time consuming, money hungry app. Could have been a $4.99-$6.99 paid app and they would have made more overall cash... But settle for your micro transactions on 1/10th of the players... poor decisions EA...",1
Good game and I am looking for the first time,5
Love it,5
Really good game,5
Really loving this game.  Its addictive and the dialogue in it is just excellent,5
This game is dope! Very original and fun! Teaches you exactly what to do! Love it!,5
Fine,5
So happy to see dungeon keeper back.  It's a little different than before but that's to be expected with the free-to-play model used,5
I would be happy to pay for a full game all at once. As it is right now it feels more like EA is just making a money grab using an old IP that's loved by gamers. When you really is the full version I will buy it.,2
"This is utter crap, it is clearly just a money hungry clan of clans rip off rather than an actual Dungeon Keeper game... You guys are horrible even the paid EA games are full of IAPs but at least they are normally playable without paying a ton of money!",1
Hours of fun,5
Fun,5
"This is a blatant cash cow barely disguised as a game. It saddens me that the mobile game industry has become like this, have you no respect? It's clear that you do not.  Please do not install this game and please do not install any other games from EA. They need to be taught that this is not acceptable, we want real games with real gameplay that isn't simply a gimmick to part you with large sums of your money.   Despicable.",1
So much no,1
I wish the creators let us play games such as dk but offline,5
Awesome graphics and great time killer,5
Cool.,4
I,5
"Pretty good, I am enjoying it so far",5
Love the game. Used to play on pc. Give us a sandbox mode haha love it.,5
Good game if bored,4
meow,5
Love it,5
It says its optimized for tablets then why when I try to download on my Samsung galaxy tab 3 it tells me its not compatible with my device????,1
I LOVED the old pic game and now I can finally ply it wherever I want. EA you have new respect from me!,5
Best game ever I love it more than clash of clans,5
Loads up and then sits on a black screen. Surprise..another not so great EA game..,1
The only thing is it takes way to long for the digging or upgrading. ..I understand things take time but this is to long. .,5
Funny,5
Waz!!,5
"Awesome fun, hilariously addictive!",5
Playing this game...great time spender...,5
"Unusual but it does what it is supposed to, waste time.",5
Great game,5
Similar to other farming games but very different at the same time,5
really fun and addictive! its basically clash of clans,5
Brings back old memories! Awesome,5
Good old game,5
So far so good love the concept and the graphics are good and smooth. Just wish you could move the camera controls were more free.,4
Didn't have no problems everthing is perfect keep it up EA,5
Fun fun fun,5
Good graphics and game play fun to play,5
"This is crap ,this is worse than the recent deadrising ,this is  another pay to win game ,this is not worth the time,this is the nail in the coffin for EA first they ruin red alert then the rest of their rts games follow. twighlight? Need I say more? Generals 2 is going to pay to win even though you payed for the game. You just lost a generation of gamers good luck milking spoild brats and no life mobile simulator douchbags who have no skill in pc or console, THIS IS NOT EVEN WORTH A SPARTANS PITTY.",1
I was told five stars would help the game provide free upgrade!  :3  Free is good.,5
Ok,5
Loved this game on PC years ago. So far they've done a good job porting it.,5
Game updates but then just keeps loading,1
It doesn't load,1
Enjoyable so far,5
Best game ever.,5
Awesome,5
But for a mobile time sink is great,5
Fun game,5
I used to play the original love it Thank you ea,5
Like it better then C.of C,5
Really fun and silly,5
Love it,5
Awsome,5
A good game,5
Very fun and simple,5
It's almost as good as the PC version... But still fun as hell!!!,5
Love this!,5
Loved all the dk games,5
Like the strategic layout,5
Raid and defend dungeons. Very different feel. I like It!,5
Sweet,5
"Why EA? Why did you take a great game and make it impossible to play without micro transactions? I'll take make money and but the classic yet better version, I dont care if I have to play it only on a computer, I'll live.",1
Unique fun rpg,5
Excellent mechanics/game type,5
Loads of fun,5
The best game on the market,5
Keeps a lot of the fun of the original in a handheld form.,5
A+,5
Reminds me of the dungeon keeper made for PC.,5
Cool,5
This game is the worst. It takes up to 24 hours to dig one tile. They completely destroyed dungeon keeper.,1
"Game is awesome! Great graphics, and great play!!",5
.....,5
Very fun,5
Very cool so far,5
Giggity,4
This is the worst game you could play,1
Sweet,5
Fun reminds me of the pc game,5
Good job. Great little game. Keeps me entertained.,5
Good game to waste a little time,5
5 *****,5
Awesome,5
Great childhood flashback,5
Great fun,5
DK for mobile! Nuff' said!,5
Games randomly disconnects ... Have had it start and not sign in so all progress missing...   Game will be dope when bugs are fixed,5
I absolutely loved dungeon keeper. But this drek simply defecated all over the title.  EA please do not put out anymore games until you get in touch with your fan base. You ruined C&C too.,1
Great game!,5
Great dungeon creator and defence,5
I love this game,5
Better then clash of clans I think anyway.,5
Loved DK back in the day Love DK now! wish there was in game purchases makes the game feel dirty but i guess its suppose to be evil.,5
EVIL,5
Would love to play this. But it says error 7 when loading.,5
Get this Game ASAP !,4
Loved it on pc..,5
This was a childhood game I have played till I beat the game and then played it again and again and could never get enough. I remember playing this on Windows 98 and now seeing it in the palm of my hands and touch screen too is just amazing. Technology has journeyed its way to something great. Greatest game to ever make a come back. I thank you EA for making this game and kept it alive.,5
Stuff,5
Fun,5
Good to just jump on and play a hit,5
Fun Fun,5
I usually dont like games like this....but i love dungeon keeper,5
J,5
A different spin on raid/defense games. Graphics look great and it plays very well. Moto X,5
"Everything is done right, there is a visual bug when opening up the DK challenges, but I know that will get fixed",5
Nice,5
Games that constantly show that paying more money means a stronger setup against everyone else is the downfall of the gaming world...,4
I remember the old DK. This game brings back some memories.  Only problem it's built on microtrasactions.  You can play this game without paying a cent.,5
Fun for hours at a time. Well built!,5
Looks like fun but as soon as u get the stone quarry it freezes. Please fix because game looks great!,2
Fun game i recomend downloading,5
Excellent,5
The graphics and everything else was top notch,5
It reminds me of the original one on pc,5
Very fun game love the imps. Reminds me of overlord for the ps3,5
"This game is awsome, live slapping around my minions like they are my b+tch",5
Fun,5
Loved it it was and is fun.,5
Good game,5
This game is great fun with a demented twist!!,5
Nice update from original version on pc,5
It's a cool bane,5
Dope,5
Clever game,5
Love this game,5
This dungeon game is cool,5
"This great, I should be sleeping! However this is just as good as the classic!‚ôé",5
Very fun!,5
So far very fun,5
Really fun and entertaining,5
I love this game from it's very humble start to now...,5
Very little of the original game left here.,2
Really enjoying this game whiling away the hours playing it.,5
Has been a great deal of fun playing a game I used to enjoy when I was younger.,4
Lots of fun,5
Good,5
this is one of the best game i've ever installed,5
Gotta do somethin,5
"Neat idea, but come on! Timers of 4 hours to build right from the start?!",3
"Pure crap, clash of Clans type game. Thanks EA for screwing up another classic. Avoid this.",1
"10 minutes in, and I'm still clicking along like an idiot to the tutorial. The pace is way too slow - give me the option to get in and play.",1
Sweet,5
Good,5
Been playing for a while now. Great game.,5
Amazing,5
A little slow compared to the PC game but that's a tablet game for ya! Hoping to see a larger dungeon then is looks like at first too. But so far its very cool!,5
Simple game,5
Good play,5
Neat fun times,5
"Man I remember playing both of the Dungeon Keepers on PC! But of course they made it for mobile by the way of ""Pay to Play"" So other than that all in all this is a great game for your phone!!",4
Awesomeness,5
Great game love it smooth play,5
The sounds are so epic and the graphics as well makes u addict this take,5
Very cool,5
"it's long time from last time I played this game,the creatures ,fight with nights, wow!........",5
"I couldn't wait for this to finish downloading. Used to pay this on pc all the time. Thanks, EA!",5
U have to buy gems with real money and u have to wait 4 hrs to dig a wall but other then that it's the real deal lol,5
the game is very good,5
Great game better than that clash game,5
Gives a whole new meaning to Dungeon keeper great graphics and battles..cool thing is you guys keeped it almost original Keep up the good work fellas,5
"Great game, loving it!",5
Creative on how they made this type of game,5
Awesome,5
Its a really good game and concept for a tower defense strategy game.,5
Great game... As good as the original pc version.,5
"played for just over an hour. less than 10 mins actually playing, rest was loading screens and error messages. absolutely requires a rock-solid network connection: even when not doing anything that has any reason to need to talk to the server, even the tiniest network disruption forces you to spend another 30 seconds on a load screen, and loses all the benefits of whatever action you were in the middle of.",1
Clash of clans competitor,5
Strategic,5
Its a good time waster.,5
I WAS excited to see dungeon keeper resurface! What happen to dungeon keeper? Time buffers? Paying for resources instead of waiting and waiting... very let down! I expected more than this childish attemp to recreate dungeon keeper. R.I.P. BULLFROG you are greatly missed!!!,1
Pretty neat,5
Old DK reinvented for mobile play!,5
...,5
Glad they finally made a sequel,5
Cant complain just a good time waster.,4
Fun,5
So far so good,5
Excellent game,5
A lot like the original I use to play on my pc. It's fun especially for a phone game.,5
Great game,5
Great PC port!,5
Really fun to play!,5
Only game I find worth playing,5
Fun. A great time killer.,5
Fun to play and relax and pass the time by good on the s4,4
Love the graphics.,5
You need to fix the scrolling aspect.  Other than that the game is good for how you changed it. I wish you kept the graphics or made them more realistic but bringing a classic game is great. Fix the bugs in the game and ill change to 5 Stars.  I'll also probably buy gems too if you fix it. Thanks,3
"Keeps a solid ballance, lacks some of the charm of the original",5
It's entertaiNing yet deliciOusly evil,5
It's cool,4
"A oldie thats come back to haunt me, in a good way. Touch controls all responsive, slapping imps has never been more entertaining!",5
This game reminds me of dungen and dragons.,5
Good way to burn some time,5
"A good game, true to the dark humor if all true others .",5
"Great on GS Note 10.1 2014,  no crashes for hours on end. Really like the narrator and slapping minions",5
Excellent,5
Love this game,5
they definitely need to bring this game back on the new consoles epic game great! put a new spin on but it is a great idea. I miss the ability to possess my minions and that would be easy add-in on the new systems. Gr8,5
Reminds me of the original,5
"Suggestion for devs- in the SUMMONING QUEUE, show what minions i allready have in my army. So i know what i need to queue up! Clash of clans..but 10 times better!!!",5
"EA did the series very proud.  I love all the DK games, and I still have them on my pc!",5
Awesome Game!,5
Loved this on pic and even though they made it into a time game like the other Facebook games. It has lots of elements from the pic game and I find it quite addictive.  Give it a try!  :),5
Good,4
Used to love the pc version back in the day!,5
Better than the average touch and builds,5
Very fun,5
Love it,5
Good game,5
I'll give a higher rating once cloud saving is enabled on this game,3
"I love this game I played a version of it on the computer, it's a like clash of clans in a way but a lot better",5
Great game!!!,5
Verry cool,5
Won't play this on Android because it's an EA game and F2P which means it needs real money to actually enjoy. EA is the worst publisher for all platforms and should not be supported. They want nothing but money and don't care about their products or tbeir quality.,1
"First game in a long time to hold my attention. Very reasonable IAPs, funny. Give it a try.",5
"Fun game, good way to pass the time",5
"Loads of fun to play, can't wait for updates and more content.",5
"This is a disgrace to the epic dungeon keeper series. You could seriously go buy the real dungeon keeper for what you pay 2500 gems. Things like this make me fear for the future of gaming...Although, a pay to win game like this isn't really that surprising coming from EA",1
Pretty cool so far N,5
Better than clash of clans,5
Weird twist on dungeon games,5
Awesome the best game in android market,5
If you really want to know ask me,1
One of the best apps so far,5
Seems like a fun and addictive game,5
Great,5
"Seriously, way to ruin good game.",1
Great game!  Free gems?,5
Cute and funny. With alittle taste of naughty. Love it,5
"Started the tutorial. Crash. Reset. The game is now stuck and doesnt accept input. I can see the imps running around but no UI elements respond when clicked. With zero method to restart a game, it is now pretty much unplayable on this phone. I would be a lot more upset if something like this happened after I spent money. Buyer beware I guess.",1
Good game.  Similarities to the DK from the pc.,5
Just like the original,5
Great game,5
Awesome,5
"I guess the ""free to play but pay to skip the slugfest"" model is here to stay.  Clever and irreverent. Good graphics. Thanks!  SGS3",5
Cookies available. I love this game. The original was fantastic and this update doesn't disappoint.,5
Constantly froze. Couldn't get through the tutorial. Will try again later.,1
Great game!,5
Great game  That's free,5
Great,5
A great build ur own dungeon with a twist,5
Fun. In depth.,4
!!!,5
Muhaha,5
"Micro transactions make this game unplayable, and a shame to the original.",1
Been playin for a hour and this is a great game,5
Great,5
Great game! I have been looking for a good game to play for awhile. I think I found it here,5
Awesome,5
Good,5
"I feel sorry for the people whose only experience with DK is this trash. The tutorial teaches the player the basic mechanic of the game:paying Gems. Want to build a room? Pay Gems! Want to create an Imp? Pay Gems! The alternative to paying is waiting a minute for each action. This isn't a game designed to entertain you. It's a game designed to bore you into paying money. EA, if you're going to make a free-to-play money grab, at least use your own brand. Have some respect for the devs you screwed over.",1
This is a fun game with good graphic.,5
Good,4
This just made my day it has a few glitches but it functions well otherwise and is still fun,5
This was an ok game till it froze after rating during the game....uninstalling,1
So far so good,5
Love it so far,5
Just as fun as I remembered,5
Clever melding of the classic DK trap lying and modern combat  casuals,5
A definite 5 star game,5
5 star,5
!,5
Nice work !! Game is pretty addictive,5
This is a great game. Lots of fun.,5
Unfortunately having to be constantly connected to the internet makes this game mostly useless.,3
"Way to take a great game and turn it into a completely insane moneygrab. Buy DK1 & 2 on GoG for next to nothing and you'll have a much better time. 24 hours to dig out a single tile (unless you pay cash, of course!)? Yeah, I'll pass.  Who is giving this game 5 stars? You can't all be EA employees!",1
Something new and refreshing,5
Nope.,1
This game is absolutely terrible 4 hours to dig rock they want you to spend gems on everything. Another EA atrocity way to ruin a classic game don't bother the fun has been sucked out of this one.,1
Addicted ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•,5
Awesome game for me get graphics funny gameplay not a child's game :D,5
As the title states.,5
AWESOME,5
ÏïÑÏïÑÏïÑÏïô„Öá„ÖáÏïÑÏïÑÏïÑÏïÑ,5
What more do you need to know.,5
Pretty fun,4
Very fun. :) Creative.,5
Good game,5
Liking the diffrent style build and raid game,4
A fun dungeon defender check Dailey kind of game,5
I have always loved this game.  I was always wanting a mobile version.  Thanx for the opportunity to play this game again :-D,5
"Fun so far, it's Easy to get into.",5
70$ for fifty blocks of space.....,1
Good game,5
"has the clash of clans feel to it but its dk. Im not fond of the gem system and will not spend money on it. if there was a paid version where gems didnt exist i would be happy to buy it over this ""free"" version",5
It's been a great lil game to play,5
Building a dungeon is fun,5
Sits at connecting forever,1
It's not the same but ea tried.,2
Loved the game on the pc back in the day.,5
Its awesome,5
Fun,5
Screw You EA why do you have to do this to our beloved games,1
Really fun game 5 stars,5
It's a fun game to play,5

"Graphics are good, gameplay is logical, and there's humor in the dialogue. Keep it going!",5
Cool,5
Great game fun to play to pass time,5
Epic,5
Cool,5
not bad so far,5
Still fun after all these years,5
Really hooked me,5
Pretty addicting,5
Hawesome,5
Fun so far. I have no complaints.,5
I used to grow up with this game. One of my most favorite games ever made!!,5
Creative and twisted,5
"The game on start up requires you to sign into Google Games. Do you think I want the game knowing my account info, much less a post on my Google plus every time I do something in game? If you cancel, it just freezes at the loading screen. In addition, to do anything in a decent amount of time, you have to pay real money. This game has solidified my lost of faith in EA. Upon the list of terrible things they have done, you can put ""turned a Real Time strategy game into a horrible free to play.""",1
Great,5
Super fun,5
Fun!,5
Very good game,5
Good,1
Great game,5
Reminds me of the old pc version. A lot of good memories.,5
Fun game! Love the way its done,5
5 stars,5
Very fun,5
Fun,5
Simple and yet effective,5
I played clash of clans but I lost my google+ so I needed to fill the void much easier to play,5
its a must download funny fun time love it!!!!,5
"Worst ""free to play"" model ever.",1
Crashes on start up on htc one,1
Fun!,5
So delightful,5
"So much fun, and very in depth! Five stars all the way",5
"So if anyone had ever played the original games they know this is a travesty. These micro transactions just stop the game. With the most gem package you can only dig out 56 blocks. The game itself is ruined, gameplay is just put to a halt.",1
Honestly the game I've been looking for an actual dungeon defender game combine with the game style of overlord still at the beginning but gets even better as you go along,5
Good graphics and sound.,5
Classic!,5
Good twist on the genre.,5
What? Is this for real EA? $70  to dig a few blocks? The micro transactions you have put in this game have completely ruined the gameplay and makes me hopeful people will see how greedy you guys are. Never touching an EA game again you greedy nubs.,1
"""hey. This action takes 12 seconds. I bet you want to pay real currency to skip it! Don't you?! Use these gems. Go on! Use them. It's OK! You can buy more later. Use the gems. Use them now! This is just the tutorial, and you only have to wait 45 more seconds.... But... GEMS!!!""  I love the concept of this game... But come on... Do you have to make the pay to win so painfully obvious... It really discourages me from playing the game at all, let alone spending real money on it.",3
Good game,5
Fun,5
Interesting still play and figure it out,5
Fun,5
"Great game for the most part, love the aspect of it and plays really well.",5
Placeholder,5
Fun,5
Good game so far nice interface,5
"App demands I make all of my google contacts known to it and wants access to posting on my profile. If I deny this permission it will demand it every time the game loads. Unacceptable. I don't mind making a login account for a game, but I'm not giving EA access to my personal life. Uninstalled.",1
"Code 17 at startup, server problem I assume. There are in-app purchases to avoid long wait times?? Regretfully uninstalling. It's probably better this way. I loved the original DK's. Would rather pay up front for great game mechanics designed around, you know, good old ""having fun"" instead of extracting money from players, which is what these IAP based games all feel hyper-focused on. It's very transparent, and not fun.  Hopefully one day it will actually be redone as a game that will just sell based on its merits. The original should've translated well to touchscreen too. So lame.",1
It is to limited you can't even move your base,1
It is a game I use to play on the PC I am so glad it came out for the tablet too,5
Good game,5
Cool twist on genre.,5
This game is neat,5
I love it! Freaking awesome game! Keep up the good work!,5
Totally different from all other games. Outstanding.,5
You need help if you buy anything in this game. Go buy the original it doesn't slow down gameplay...,1
Actually maintains a lot of the old-school PC game's vibe.  Pretty fun,5
Takes me back in time. Well done.,5
I absolutely love this game DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!!!,5
Awesome game,5
Aaaaaawwwwwwsssssssoooooooommmmmmmmeeeeeeeee!,5

Great time waster as I am waiting for troops to cook in Clash of Clans... takes tower defense and clash of clans and makes a while new game!,5
AWESOME,5
Get it and play it NOW,5
Anyone willing to pay ¬£70 to play this game for about five hours instead of buying about ten of the much better original game is insane and should not have access to any amount of money.,1
Great time killer,5
I'm new to the genre but this is a lot of fun.,5
Sweet game.  Hope you download on a weekend off.......,5
Pretty in depth all you need now is pets,5
Awesome,5
Great game. Deff worth downloading if you like tower defense games.,5
Nice and time consuming,5
"Great graphics, great game play, so far so good",5
Fun to ply,5
This game is so addicting and is so fresh...it is amazing!!!,5
Brings back memories!,5
Looks like all the games will be free soon all we have to do is endure the relentless ads and upsale attempts just like when people pay for cable but still have to watch the ads.....something is backwards here or is it just me?,5
It is the best game I ever played,5
This game is so cool its better than clash of clans,5
Verry fun game,5
Good game so far. Good time killer.,5
It has big building requirements right away which also takes a lot of gems ti finish right away to get started,5
I was not able to even start playing and then when I tried to restart the game it would exit out,1
Game,5
Cool nonstop fun game!!!,5
Goooood,5
Good game,5
Culd have a little less swearing,5
Looks like a pretty good game!,5
Fun and simple,5
Fun,5
Good,5
This reminds me of the Dungeon Keeper I was playing when I was a kid so it's pretty cool.,5
"The gems are a pain, but I am just excited this title is finally getting attention again.",5
Tutorial was way too long and way too confusing didn't understand,1
Fun addicting and pleasureful,5
New and fun.,5
Glad the brought this to Apps,5
terrible terrible game. As an avid player of the PC version this makes me vomit. 70 Quid is best value? The fact you've sucked these people in is terrible enough. But you nuggets make me sick with this game. So sod off because I am NOT using this. (P.s for 70 Quid you could buy 20 copies of The original dungeon keeper for you and your friends),1
Reminds me of old dungeon keeper 1,5
Easy to play.,5
Awesome game,5
Well done,5
Immediately,5
This game brought back so  many great memories.,5
"This game may have been a little ahead of its time when it was first released on the PC. The phone version is great fun and easy to play, I'm glad to see it's resurrection!",5
Overall the games pretty fun and the game plays great good game for a phone:)	Overall the games pretty fun and the game plays great good game for a phone:),5
Why can't there be a paid version? Does everything have to be a fricking money grab EA?  This is why your called the worst company in America year after year.  Uninstalling and buying the original games on GOG so I can play a proper game.,1
The game wanted a 5 star rating!,5
Good game,5
Fun,5
It's feels good to take some anger out on my minions,5
"Just what I was looking for, the wait time is low, the reward output is high, and the tutorial explains everything. Great game on Samsung galaxy S3. No freezes no force closes and from what I saw no ads.",5
Best game so far that I've downloaded.,5
Great game! Top quality like a premium game. Better than the PC version.,5
Good,5
Fun game to play,5
Awesome game,5
More gold,5
Fun to play,5
Great game,5
Pretty good game its definitely going to compete with clash of clans,5
Cool,5
This game is boss,5
Great,5
Takes a full day to do ONE block???,1
Pretty cool.,5
Brings back memories this game came out originally when I was like 2.,5
You have out done your self's but the minion animation could use a bit of tuicking other than that ea you are amsing,5
Great game,5
Done,5
Fun so far,5
No. Just. No.,1
Great game,5
Keeps exiting me out of game but might just be my nook. So I will not drop stars.,5
"I've always loved this game, and its still fun on the tablet",5
Its a twist to clash of clans. So far so good!,5
Awesome.,5
not original,1
:-) :-) :-),5
Epic game,5
Cool,5
Very fun game from good ol EA.,5
Another IAP disaster.  Wait ten hours or pay a thousand dollars to upgrade now.  Don't waste your time or money,1
"Great, lemmings type game.",5
I cant stop playing. Half my day involves the game,5
Back in the day this was the game I loved to play more that all others... Smacking minions was the best! No really.... The best!,5
OK Okokokokokokkokokokkokoko,5
"Free, fun, but has flaws",4
This game is great! Runs smooth. Haven't had any trouble with it.,5
Rad game.,5
Extremely overpriced in-app purchases,1
Great,5
Henrik's,5
Highly addictive and the new concept makes it one of the the better tower defense games I have played :-),5
For now.,5
G,5
Yay,5
Awesome,5
Creative,4
Controls don't work to well,4
Very addictive,5
It is nice to not be bothered to buy something in game every five seconds. This game does not ask,5
Yep,5
Great game,5
Awesome game 4/5,4
"It has its micro transactions, but these days, what doesn't? They're nowhere near as bad as most of the freemium titles they have out there now a days",5
Great game so far. Looks good an very original. Keep up the great work.,5
Good fun,5
"I owned and played the original dungeon keeper. I still fire it up in dosbox. This game is a wretched caricature of that beloved title. It is a sterile, soulless money mooching horror. Lacks the charm and strategy of the original and exists solely to make an easy buck. TL;DR its an EA game, need I say more?",1
U can buy A brand new game from the store for 70$ or 14000 gems what???,1
Good,5
Just like clash of clan s,5
Yes. Just yes.,5
The game sets you up to survive some tower defnse games don't give you that little knowlege and you tend to fail a lot before you get it. Here they tell you what you can do and how to do it both visually and audubly. Good game overall,5
So micro transactions such bad much cost  Wow.,1
"This was my favorite game back in the day, its been fifteen plus years since I played this, and I've been searching on e bay and amazon for it. Love this game.",5
Cool,5
"Solid, fun and creative..but I is very annoying that Ea didn't keep this game true to the originals.	Very fun... solid graphics and style... For thoes who love this type of gaming where you  wait forever to build and develop or pay to enjoy the game when you need to pass time or have free time.  It will never live up to the originals.  This is based solely on the fact that Ea had to change what made the first titles great GAMEPLAY that was and still is unique, fun, and hard to do right. Instead EA sold out and is followin this very annoying style of gaming that is the trend on phones.",5
"Had a lot of fun with the original,  this is a nice tribute.",5
Way to screw up another franchise ea. More FTP/IAP bullshit. Could have been so much better....,1
Great game funny and a good fime waster,5
It is a nice oldschool game.,5
Pretty ok,5
"Cool,fun,awesome its A good GAME",5
Lol,5
I miss playing this game on my pc when I was a ki glad they brought back!,5
Same ole same,5
Loved this game on console!  Totally pumped to be able to play it again on my tablet!  Looks great and everything controls just fine so far.,5
Omg get now too good,5
This is the most utterly revolting game I have ever seen. You should all be ashamed.,1
Goo,5
I use to love the DK games for PC and this game is a great mobile version! Must have.,5
I love this game it makes me laugh and has grabbed my attention,5
Fun Fun Fun Fun,5
Good game so far lots to do,5
This is a great Game,5
Pretty fun if your into these types of games,5
Great tons of time spent on this piece of art,5
Great game,5
"Very Fun, build dungeons, defend and conquer. 5 stars",5
Good game,5
Fun,5
Fun so far,5
Very good game,5
Free games like these should leave games forever. Dont give this game a cent.,1
Truly awesome that it has risen from the grave.,5
Takes me back to the good old days of PC gaming!,5
Amazing,5
Great,5
HORRIBLE,1
Kool,5
It's good,5
Not a bad build at all.,5
Awesome app!!,5

Brings back a lot of memories,5
I love this game since the original version for pc,5
Very addicted,5
Look title,1
"This is a good fun game.  Works well so far, my new favorite game",5
"A little slow to start but once you get the hang of it, it's a blast :-)",5
O man my favorite game as a kid,5
The game is not worth playing when you grind to a complete halt because it takes 24 hours to dig out a single block unless you have gobs of real money. Go to good old games website and download the original dungeon keeper 1 and 2. Not as pretty but only $6 and you will enjoy it way more.,1
Great game I've ben lookin for a game like this for a wile,5
Good,5
Fun as hell,5
"Not running on nexus 7 original. I use to love this game, how disappointing.",1
So far it works good for me,5
"This game is  insulting. Right of the bat, the tutorial teaches you how to spend money to speed the game along. The game actually tells you "" don't be stingy"" when spending money. Are you serious?  Me paying for you product isn't a joke. The pace of this game, if you don't pay, is.",1
Awesome game,5
Looks to be better than Clash of Clans!?!,5
"Great game, based off the computer game",5
Cool but its just like clash of clans but in a dungeon so  hopefully the next game you come up with is original not a copy of a different game but still cool,5
Lulz funny stuff,5
Must have for people who like tower defence,5
"Having to be online constantly to play is irritating, and it definitely is a heavily based micro transaction game, but it is definitely fun",4
"Nice job, keeps you entertained and very addicting",5
It's Clash of Clans with DK artwork. I was hoping for real DK.,2
Download and love it,5
Fun game,5
"Fun app, great for those who love dungeon games and games like clash of clans",4
Only because you asked for 5,4
Pretty cool game.,5
Addicting,5
"Keep your ""free"" app. I don't need you collecting all my personal info and trying to see who my friends are on Google+",1
Game won't even get past the load screen so I can't play it. 0 stars HTC evo 3d,1
Thanks,5
This game is a lot of fun!,5
Neat game.,5
Fun game,5
Best of the best,5
"Not the same as the original from Bullfrog, but fun just the same!",5
I hate micro transactions and this is really bad.,1
The best,5
Turur√∫ que no me lleg√≥ la la gente IIS la gente IIS yo no se si su casa a,5
Great fun,5
cool game,5
Love this game.,5
Novel and enjoyable game so far,5
It's a decent time killer,4
Fun game.,5
The basics are get units destroy dungeons defend your own,5
"Please please add an option to turn down the volume. The whole point of a mobile platform is being able to use your device everywhere, even places where there are other people.",3
Cool,5
"This isn't even worth trying. If you want to tap something and either wait several hours to a day(s?) or pay $100's to progress even slightly, then be my guest. Otherwise, this isn't the game for you.",1
Usually I don't like your games but you combined two AMAZING games.,5
Is the best game ever,5
"Fun game, so far I like it",5
Good,5
For sure,5
Awesome,5
Lots of fun,5
Fun,5
"I am a huge fan of the original game, and they ruined this  one with dumb, idiotic, pointless, game ruining, money grabbing micro transactions.   fin.",1
This game is like a mix of tower defense and Overlord! I love it!,5
Loved it on pc. Love the upgrades on the phone version,5
Nice game!!,5
It is amazing,5
"If you want to have fun playing this game, prepare to pay hundreds of dollars (I'm not kidding).",1
Very fun,5
It is awsome cluck a doodle do,5
A little baggy but besides that great game,4
Very good,5
I just love it so much,5
Im not a big fan of EA... but kudos to whomever brought this idea to the table.  Id like to think that theres a big market out there for old gems like these.,5
Its weird but cool,5
Good game,5
In the format,5
Fun little game,5
Its a lot of fun,5
This game is free just so it can drain your wallet slowly and painfully.,1
Am I the only one sick of freemium games?,5
This game is really fun you can slap your minions,5
Great free to play adaptation of a classic game.  Can't put it down!,5
I enjoy playing this amazing game!!!!!,5
One of the best games i found,5
Pretty cool game. Not difficult to figure out at all,5
"Even with all the micro-transactions, I really enjoy playing this mobile version of Dungeon Keeper/DK. It's easy to learn too!!  I recommend this.",5
Awesome,5
GREAT game. Love it even more if they added more :-) :-) :-),5
The graphics are cool and I like when the guy talk to you in tutorial its simple yet addicting,5
Super dope.,5
"please do not get this...please, 24 hours to dig out one block bad",1
Something to do to help.pass the time.,5
Really fun Great game to play,4
In game chat deletes itself sometimes. You click send but it doest show up. Gold production ratio needs to be upgraded. Otherwise great tower game. Love it :),4
They are stupid,1
I can't really think of words to describe this game with. But it is quite comical and fun to play and expand your dungeon!,5
This isnt Dungeon keeper. This is a pay to win tower defense. EA putting another bullet in a classic game. Sleep well in the pit with the rest of the bullfrog library.,1
Fun game,5
As soon a it loads it crashes everytime or i get an error message. Seems like a good game if i could even play,1
Good,5
Great fun game,5
Awesome,5
Pretty Fun so Far!,5
Fun to play and really keeps you entertained with it's sense of humor.,5
Great,5
Great,5
Fun game,5
Pay to play $$$$$.  Defense does not work.,1
"So fun, been playing constantly for a few hours",5
Back in the day I played this on a P133 and loved it!   This version is bad for the following reasons. The 'tutorial' doesn't allow multitasking. You HAVE to be online to play.   If I choose to play this again it will be when they come up with a PAID version.,5
Memories,5
Lots of fun.   Especially love the revenge feature  - great entertainment to strategize how to best defeat the guy who just  took your gold!,5
By far one of my most favorite retro games ever...,5
It's pretty good so far for a free to play model,5
This game it's cool,5
"Take a popular existing game style, make build times longer and charge higher prices, and you get the next greed filled garbage pile EA has to offer. If you like clash of clans or similar games but really want a game that will force you to declare bankruptcy for a small hint of nostalgia, choose this game. It even comes with an awesome tutorial that suggests you spend real money freely at all times, forcing players into the mentality that waiting 10 seconds instead of spending $5 is for scrubs.",1
Great game play,5
Great game,5
So far....so fun,5
Nice one,5
It keeps you involved and missing all kinds of work.,5
Well done and has great potential.. Bring on the updates.,5
Excellent modernization of a classic.,5
Fun!,5
EA did it again.  IAP overload.,1
Evily fun trashing minoins Devilushy downgrading targets,5
I'm enjoying the game so far. My only problem is how long it takes to build certain items.,5
Brings back so many awesome memories and hours and days of fun.,5
Pretty fun,5
"So far I like it, but I hate the macro transaction process.",5
Great game super addictive!,5
"Lots of updates that are not represented in its size on the play store, froze tablet on launch.  Never ran.  A big disappointment.",1
Each additional star will cost you $4.99.  Thanks for ruining a classic game with your greed.,1
Just not to clear via tips on what to do,5
I like it,5
"Due to always wanting to try and connect to server, when it does connect it doesnt last long enough to start playing before it disconnects. Went to black screen 3 times before i gave up, ill try again in a week if there isnt another getting my attentiin and money. AT$T HTC One. Android 4.3",1
Only concern is it takes way to much time invested into upgrading your buildings and clearing out some things. Enjoyable though,5
The time aspect can both be frustrating and rewarding when its over.,5
It is a good game,5
Great game,5
"I love bossing the imps around.  Classic Dungeon Keeper humor, fun gameplay.  This one's a keeper.",5
Cool,5
Great,5
Fantastic game!!!!!,5
There are a lot of games of this type and this one is definitely the best one I've played.,5
Cool,5
"DK fans need to get this. If you're not one get it anyway. Excellent game, excellent series, nuff said.",5
"I'm a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, but this is really just a class of clans clone in a DK skin.",2
This was one of my favorite games of all time.  EA has captured the spirit of the originals perfectly.  Good job guys!,5
Title says it all.  A classic game ruined in an attempt to nickel and dime their fans.,1
Entertaining,5
"I love dungeon keeper, but this is a garbage clash of clans clone. I'm sad. I'd rather pay a dollar or two for a real game instead of this free micro transaction garbage!",1
Love these classic games,5
Like the old days,5
The start is a bit slow,5
Good,5
Awsome,5
Fun game,5
I like games that let you build city or kingdom,5
Yo mama,5
Great!!!,5
Greatgame,5
Still cant put it down!,5
Great,4
Awesome.,5
Awsome,5
Lots of fun,5
Very good game,5
I love this game,5
Can't get enough of it,5
Enjoyable,5
Fun,5
Great game,5
Great remake!!:-),5
"Fun, impressive graphics",5
"Although fun I get the impression that past a certain point the game becomes pay-to-win.  Additionally the UI has some serious issues.  Had several instances where I was unable to zoom/scroll, where buttons would not register, and where the touch screen calibration seemed off (digging squares would start on blocks above or below or besides the one I was trying to hit).  Way too many buttons on the screen since the last update.  Final straw for me was when I accidentally opened the 'buy resources' tab while trying to scroll and then accidentally bought three things I didn't want before I could close the tab.  The 2 seconds to cancel a purchase using premium currency (no confirmation dialog) is completely unacceptable design.  I was frantically trying to cancel the transaction, pressed the cancel icon several times and instead of registering it just bought anther one.  Uninstalled.",2
Yeah I thought this was going to be stupid..game is sooo much fun highly recommended,5
"It prompts me to log in and accept terms of agreement but it wont pass the ""accept"" screen. It replaces the word with ""create."" I already have an account too and I know im not doing anything wrong. Just noting a gamebreaking bug.",5
Its an old fav from computer on tablet sweet  1,5
The Vitus got fixed,5
Lots of extras and hard levels. Great way top ignore peopl when your playing this game 5 stars!,5
Excellent,5
Its a good game,5
Had fun with this game back in the day... Glad to see it on the andriod list... Good job. Thanks,5
Keeps rebooting me to the start of the game,1
Addicting!,5
Good,5
Just like the old days..,5
Easy to catch on to,5
"I played the original on PC. Great job on the mobile app. Sadly, seems another app geared to make people whip out their credit card...should make it less gems to add workers",5
"This game is very fun and gas  great graphics. I'm having problems with it tho. The game is not allowing me to upgrade my mines, It won't let me place my traps and my minions can't dig through the walls.  Hopefully this can get fixed. Other than that it's a cool game",3
"Cool game,I use to play it on pc when I was younger. I can tell that this one is really different and fun",5
Awesome,5
Good,5
Awesome!! Love the demons voice!!,5
"Pretty good game, I like it ‚úå",5
Yup,5
I played the original and this one is also good,5
I have my own dungeon,5
"100% pay to win. Payers build faster, bothnin builder numbers and in builder speed boosts. Then they get real and huge boosts in battle. If you want a fighting chance at competing expect to spend at least a few HUNDRED dollars.",1
Latest update has enabled viewing fellow guild member's lairs which is nice. Fun to play but you can't compete and earn upgrades past a certain level unless you spend money. Typical EA.,4
Great game. :-),5
its interesting,5
God mechanic's and love the guide his voice is awesome,5
Vince likes it and so do the girls,5
"I love this game  but ,  the guilds are unavailable. And   I think we should get a daily amouth of gems and gold and rocks to get help",4
"This game has serious potential, I really like it. However, it is completely and utterly RUINED by the extremely unbalanced gem mechanic. For example, you're first imp costs 1000 gems, yet you earn a pathetic 5 gems PER achievement. But like all ""Freemium"" games you have the option to pay your way through. Its $20 for 2500 gems (JUST enough to get 2 imps). So not only is the earning mechanic hopeless beyond belief, but the ""pay to play"" is grossly over priced. I have no problem paying $5-10 a month to keep up, but $50 is quite a stretch. Why not change the cash hungry gem mechanic and make it atleast remotely possible to earn your own gems so we could play a game with real progression, instead of credit card payments. So close, yet so far EA.",2
Loved dungeon keeper 2 for computer excited for this,5
Great game!,5
Shame on you EA! Shame for taking one of the best games in history and turning it into a pathetic cow clicker! This us yet another Farmville no one wants.,1
Boots me out of game while in battle. On restart.  Loose all progress have to 're log in.,1
Despite like most mobile games the constant prompt to use micro transactions it retains its entertainment value and if you like the dungeon keeper games and don't mind slightly longer build times it's a great way to kill a few extra minutes here and there,5
Totally rocks,5
Try it and see,5
best game ever !!!,5
Just started playing seems good,5
Neat!! Great artwork and fresh take on a favorite theme.,5
Just downloaded it and was hooked,5
"Error codes 2 and 3,unable to get further than the loading screen",1
Just like the old original game,5
Cool,5
Yolo,5
Wicked game,5
Used to play the original DK. This isn't quite the same but it's fun!,5
10.2/10,5
Good game,5
Downloads 1 to 7 patches EVERY time so it takes forever to log in,2
Love it,5
Very addictive,5
A fun installment to a great franchise.,5
Ridiculous construction times plus constant raids make it pointless,1
Good game but really very buggy. You need to have lots of patience to play this game.,3
"Could use a bit of work. Too small and hard to watch minions attacking, defending",5
Extremely fun game,5
Top game,5
Surprise! Cost of getting an extra imp went up by over 300% with the latest update. And tends to get pretty grindy after you reach 1000 combat points,1
Awesome,5
"Great graphics, great gameplay",5
No flaws . work perfect on SGs4,5
Excellent,5
Needs to go quickir,5
Everytime I open the app now it starts a new game. Getting very frustrated when it shows me my world I touch anything and it instantly open the loading page and start a new one. I'm very disappointed that the game is updated now I'm unable to play at all anymore unless I want to continuously start a new game everytime I open the app,1
"AWEsome, this would be fun on console gaming too.",5
Dungeon,5
Good,5
Wow this is a great game,5
"Keeps you wanting more, havnt had any problems with loading game I run galaxy 3g",5
Very fun,5
Game,5
Good job EA!,5
Awesome game. A tad slow but love it anyways,5
I'm new on the game and still trying to understand it but so far so good!,4
Loved this game when it was on the PC and could not be more excited to play it on my tablet now!,5
Cool game,5
Great fun,5
"Played this as a kid.  Loved it then,  love it now.",5
"I played the original when it first came out on PC.  I was actually thinking about this game recently,  and here it is on my phone!!",5
This was such a good game back in the day. Very unpleased that they had to change all the gameplay features for touchscreen and pay for stuff ingame. The positive side is its a very strategic game very challenging and addictive. Everyday i login more than 5 times. Buildings are constructed over time which takes a lot of it sometimes. Spells level up the more u use them. Graphics are nice! Overall 4 on 5 since they let down the old dk2 and had to make this mobi game instead of a pc one to continue the series,4
Enjoyed the game but it restarted on me. My whole dungeon gone.. just when i spent a bit of extra cash too... I see others are having this problem too. Lost a lot of respect. Dungeon name: Vongola,1
"Super fun, enjoy it a lot!!",5
This game rocks,5
Great graphics and fun game play.,5
What could go wrong?,5
If you're going to use the Dungeon Keeper name you could at leadt make it like Dungeon Keeper games.,1
Great game but unplayable without spending real money constantly. It would be nice if you could just spend $2.99 and have it functional.,4
"I get fewer glitches playing on an Android tablet than on ios4 phone...overall, a pretty good game.  Wish they'd drop the gem cost on items (but what can you do),  I still play & I still enjoy it.",5
Omg thats one of my old fav game,5
Updated today and now when I try to load just goes to a black screen :s is this a common issue?,4
Yeah,5
"Ever hear the saying ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""? EA hasn't. This game gets worse with every update, and I'm sick if it. Invasive interface,  expensive imps (800 gems for a third one,  compared to 200 before the update), and slow,  expensive upgrades. An FTP game that really, really wants your money. Uninstalling.",1
Fix the stupid disconnect and reset to beginning of game bug already. Completely unplayable on LG optimus LTE. Mildly playable on HP touchpad. Getting really sick of seeing horney every time it glitches.,1
Soooo addicting,5
"Well made game, runs well",5
I really like this game!,5
Great game,5
Now that I'm in I'm evil,5
"Well done game, better with  the updated but service cuts in and out when game is loaded.  other than that just well rounded fun game",5
Its an ok game for a few minutes a day....when it worked....,2
"As others commented, fun for about 5 mins +/- a day. Unless you spend a mint on gems...but EA is over the top greedy in this. And what's with the length of time to launch this app??? it's like watching grass grow........expected more of EA.",1
I remember playing the old desktop version many many years ago!,5
Try it,5
"They just take our money. No respect for the player. The gems are costly. Takes way too long to dig. Build times are insane, took me several days of waiting because the build times take up more time the more you play. 800 gems for an imp? Really? Not sure how thy hope to stay on top, after playing for a while and realising the system, you feel like it's another internet scam to get your money. Uninstalling this game after this post.",1
After last update. The patch will not install. Havent bin able to play for a week,1
I'll change my rating if the patch gets fixed.  It sucks to play a game for weeks then there is a new update and BOOM can't play it anymore due to a patch error.,1
Great loved it,5
Good game,5
"I enjoy this game, very easy to pickup and play!",5
Awsome,5
"Something new, guilds...nice way to add coop to this we'll see how it plays over time. An upgrade to the layout but I don't like what came with it, u can't view your inventory like how many specific traps I have, its covered by the upgrade on next level banner and how many minions I have, thats gone, these little things please bring back...and in guilds you cannot visit members dungeons, its not working when you click to visit. It used to run flawlessly onmy galaxy note 10.1 pre 2014 but now lags and very choppy. Its been crashing during raid far too frequently and replays have disappeared, please bring that back as well as it is a great tool to help better build the dungeon...I spend on in game curency once in awhile but you spend on gems and what you get out of it ingame is horrendous,  $10 in and you get an imp then to help speed build times $5 will let u dig up 5 hard rock spaces....just madness! Love the game addicted to building but its been taking a turn, and as for a free game its very costly for anyone to look into buying into game currency...if things were cheaper then you might attract more to buy into it.",3
Fun,5
Tons of fun,5
Good game,5
About time the game gods thought to re-release this title in some form!	Now release DK3 for PC/Consoles!,5
Good job,5
Good game funny story,5
Fun and quick.,5
"Been playing this game since  launch, now since the update I get an error 2 message. Each update they increase the gem cost on items and minions. Kinda annoyed this has not been fixed. Lost interest now as I am not waiting forever for a fix.",1
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY MADE IT FOR ANDROID!,5
"i used to like this game but when you get disconnected from a dungeon raid almost every time, coupled with the new layout resulting in going to buy new resource pages all the time.  this is now just a unreliable money grab on ea's part.",2
The screen is so cluttered now.. shame on you guys!,2
"The only thing I really dislike is having to ""connect"" each time I log in and ""check for new updates"" it is so slow and takes forever",5
I love this game solo much,5
Awesome,5
"I keep getting ""error 2"" when I try to start the game since the last update. Gem pricing is out of hand, and spending $ for advantages only helps those willing to spend a lot of real money. I would much rather pay a flat rate for the game.",2
cool,5
Funnnn as f@@@,5
It's really unfortunate that the most recent update to the game doesn't work. Every time I load the game I get an Error 2 or Error 3 message and then the game ceases to load. Just when I got into the game too. I hope it gets fixed otherwise I'm not playing this game. Not by choice but because the game won't work until the patch downloads.,1
"I think this is a good genre for the game to be adapted to, but   I really hate the fact that you can pay for an attack advantage via the trap vision. Paying for dungeon progression is fine and in line with others of the genre, but paying for an advantage like this in battle is not ok",3
Multiplayer aspects really add to the game.,5
Love the concept,5
"Would be a great game, if it  worked reliably, and you weren't completely dependent on buying gems to do anything at all.  Good concept. EA's greed ruined it.",1
There is no reason EA needs to know who I talk to or my phone status.,1
"Has me checking on my dungeon regularly, but way too much emphasis on buying  ""gems"". Upgrades quickly jump to taking days to complete...meaning there is nothing to do but wait, and wait, and...wait; unless you buy gems.",3
It works on my Samsung S3 but not with the Tab7 which sucks cos I would like to play on a bigger screen.  Also pls fix the bugs for the battle replays as it always crashes and I have to force shut down the game.,3
"How have you not fixed this thing yet. Still have to start building then log out cause if anything finishes before you log out it is not saved, built my third Treasury kept playing and upgrading stuff so of course it finished and I logged out. Nothing saved and lost 20 minutes of play time plus over an hour of build time cause everything I did was gone... Not the first time.",2
Freemium component of the game is near mandatory and continually thrown in your face ruining gameplay.  IAP's are being sold harder then a timeshare and game design is clearly second to monetizing.,1
No where near a true remake.. This is at its heart is a tower defense game with numerous in-app purchases.. Thanks again EA for a poor reconstruction of a past gem.,1
awesome game,5
Lol,5
I enjoyed the original and also like this version.  Works fine on a Samsung Galaxy G3.,5
Absolutely lives up to my expectations from the PC game!,5
A bit slow with so few imps without paying for them. But a good game.,5
Cool,5
"Silly, but fun.",5
Fun,5
"Awesome, good choice of a classic game to make for Android!",5
"Yes, enjoyed this yrs ago on a PC. Just as enjoyable as ever on a pad. A must have game.",5
Great game,5
Lol,4
5,5
Fun,5
Good game,5
"Well made, fun",5
"I never played the original, but I am quite enjoying this.  Being a mobile version, I appreciate that the pacing is designed in such a way that I can put things in motion before tending to real-life responsibilities, and when my interest is piqued again, my previous tasks have been completed just in time.  With each step up the ladder, I'm finding a deeper strategy required beyond simply flooding a dungeon with minions; other players and their insanity are what keep this game fresh and entertaining!",5
I used to have the PC version of this game.   This version is just as much fun.,5
This is not the beloved dungeon keeper of old. Great concept but it takes days for mediocre enhancements which also takes days for you too save up for and you will need to spend real money to be able to advance after a certain point.,2
Very good game,5
Good. Not like the original but it that was obvious going in. Not being able to reset and start from the beginning it why I'm giving it 4 stars,4
Until everybody started exploiting and surrounded their hearts with reenforced walls.  Uninstalled,1
Great time killer and fun.,5
So fun,5
"Great Game, loved the old one",5
Cool game,5
Cfun game,5
Not quite like the comp version but still very entertaining,5
Awsome,5
I love it!,5
Cool,5
"Great to have this classic back,  and even better than before!",5
remind me good old days !,5
Fun and addictive. Really well made.,5
Great,5
"This game rapidly becomes unplayable unless you're willing to continously she'll out tons of cash. If not, you'll soon be waiting DAYS for anything to happen. This game could be amazing if not for the ridiculous timers. Invest your time (and/or money) in something you can actually play.",3
Great,5
Good.,5
Fun,5
Play it,5
Boo ya,5
Great game,5
It sucks,1
Gotta play it. Has no issues thus far,5
Cool,5
Awesome game,5
Eh I enjoy lol,5
Very fun,5
Always loved this game,5
Great,5
I hate this game,1
Lags a little but that could be my phone. Lots of humour and fun time waster.,5
I loved dungeon keeper and this app really brings me back,5
Awesome,4
Great addictive gameplay. Lots of fun,5
"Very similar to Clash of Clans, but different enough to be entertaining",5
D.,5
Very awesome,5
A lot better than I though it would be,5
"I am a huge Dungeon Keeper fan, but unfortunately this is most certainly, without a doubt, NOT a Dungeon Keeper game. It is an okay free to play game, but is not and will never be a Dungeon Keeper game.",2
Fun,5
Cool game!,5
It brings me back to the old dungeon keeper. I enjoy this remake,5
Loving it so far.,5
"They did a decent job bringing this game to the handheld devices,  still getting into it but enjoying it  Worth a shot at its price.",4
I love it!!  ITS  cute & funny & Exciting!  :D,2
Fun,5
Does not take itself too sseriously,5
This game draws me ever deeper.,5
Jus like the old one but better graphics,5
"Everything is dependent on gems that you must buy. For example, you have to wait five minutes just to summon five of the most basic minions, or pay for them instantly with gems. This turns it into the world's most tedious and unplayable turn based strategy game where even the most basic action takes ten minutes.  Awful version, and I loved the original.",1
"Pc version is best, love this game tho",5
Fun and a bit addicting small crash problem on HTC one s but well made.,4
Awesome,5
Very nice little game keep those update coming and new add on,5
Excellent,5
Solid fun!,5
Good game,5
Fun,5
"I have paid for gems. Lately the server has been dropping me while mid victory during raids. I am losing both my minions and the plunder that I had been earning. This might be acceptable if I haven't traded real money for resources in game. If the battle was to continue after I have been dropped and I still earned my resources and points, that would be acceptable. But as it stands I feel like I'm being ripped off.",2
Fun,4
Like the game,5
"I loved the original Dungeon Keeper, but this all-new DK is leaving me cold. A lot of the control you had over minions is gone, making the game much more a tower defense affair than before. You're confined to building a single dungeon. You're  no longer fighting the good folk from towns like Snugglebunny, taking a lot of the unique flavor out of the game. Most damming though, is that things take so long to do that I'm pretty much forced to play for a short bit, then walk away for hours.",3
No fun not dungeon keeper at all just another way ea wants all your money look up war for the overworld on steam if you want a real DK game,1
I love games like this.,5
Tastes like chicken Edit - strange new bug that prevents the buying of gem (following the push notification regarding a gift of 500 gems). Otherwise very fun game.,4
I love this game. however it unplayable. you can‚Äôt even  load into your dungeon!,1
love it,5
Im in love with this game,5
Its not to bad but it is based on time and if you don't want to wait then you need to spend your real moneyfoods,2
Good,5
Fun A++,5
Super adicting.,5
Great game. Loved it when it  was on PC back in the day.  And love it now that it's portable,5
"I initially gave this 5 stars because it's pretty fun. However, it is extremely unstable and is constantly losing connection with the server. This results in it being practically unplayable. I'm still going because I do like what's there and hope they fix this problem, but no more stars until they do. I will certainly not pay into it at all while the risk of losing resources due to interrupted raids remains so ridiculously high.",2
"Was hoping for a direct port, not this conventional f2p slowdown.  Everything takes forever and all of the charm of the PC games is missing.  Also shoves Google+ down my throat, but on the bright side, doing so made me able to review the game.",2
Cool,5
Fun enough,5
Good game,5
You have ruined what was once a great game.,1
good,5
Pretty neat early on,5
Decent,5
Awesome,5
"Played this game years ago for home pc, just found this game app and it's just as I remembered.too kool.!!",5
Great game!,5
Dont play this game unless you love fantasy and apps tuat are addictive!!!! Wooo hooo!!!!,5
Good game,5
really fun,5
Wicked game,5
Good,5
Still awesome,5
Suck it,3
"This game was developed by guys with great skills,  and absolutely no business sense.",2
Good game,5
Looks Amazing!,5
Obviously you need to have this as a full time job or be independently wealthy to total slay at this game... Otherwise it is a good time killer,5
"Pretty fun game,not sure why I was reading other comments about long load times. I have an LG G2 and the game is fast to update and load.",5
Love it,5
The redesign is fun and keeps you coming back for more.,5
"Great build, no downtime its continuous fun.",5
"Played this game for about 2 months now, and while there are aspects of the game that can be quite enjoyable, I will have to say that EA's over-the-top greed with its micro transaction strategies have butchered this game.   I understand that money needs to be made and that there is really no such thing as 'free', but to scale up item costs in game to a point where real money becomes a requirement is just downright ridiculous for a 'free install'.   Good job EA, you've done it again.",1
Great game,5
Fun fun,5
"Not as detailed as the original PC game, but has the same attitude!",5
Is a great app,5
Great game,5
Bad graphics,2
Super fun. And highly addictive  lol,5
Good Throwback to DK 2,5
Great fun app.  Some things would have been nice like either a cheeper 3rd imp or an achievable gem amount for it (10$ is to much for one item and 800 gems takes waaaaaay to long to earn)  other than that feels fun to sink a bit of time in and watch people die horribly in your dungion.,4
This game is garbage. Well its actully decent IF the app stays open....constant crashes and connectivity issues...I didnt expect much though since its by EA....do not buy unless you have patience....,1
Great game,5
I love this game. Its funny and have good gameplay .,5
"Very cool mix between traps, spells, buildings and upgrades. Good game",5
Epic game. Love everything about it so far.,5
Lover this game,5
Classic.,5
Sweet game,5
Good time killer,5
This is not the same dungeon keeper I used to know ‚Ä¶ a fun game but only shares a name with that classic. There needs to be a confirmation on gem sending or some way to undo accidental purchases ‚Ä¶ I just wasted 500 gems!!! Arrrggghhhh!!!!!    Edit - 1 star (zero if i could) just wasted 600 gems accidentally hurrying a gold storage - I'm finished with this game... the GEM cash grab makes this game worth passing on. DON'T BOTHER!!,1
Good game.,5
I expected more from this but it was alright not as good as the Pc version but still worth downloading,4
So far so good.,5
Really fun,5
"Im a big fan but due to the incredibly slow progress unless you pay, I think I'll stick to the original PC version DK1 & DK2...or the fan-based sequel available on STEAM: War for the Overworld",5
5* BEST GAME,5
Ok,5
Fun game and works good no issues yet gs3&n4,5
Just as I remember it other than the pay to play part...,5
J'ai bien aim√© dk sur pc. Celui-ci semble plus complet. Il plante √† l'occasion par contre.,4
Great,5
Not quite like the original but very addictive just the same.,5
Awesome,5
Awesome game I highly recommend this.,5
Brings back memories...,5
One of the imps does a great impression of you!,5
very good,5
for free it is a good game,5
I loved the original for pc anf this is a great remake of a classic,5
"This game is fluid, user friendly and addictive. Only point which isn't great, takes too long to have resources.",5
I LOVE THE GRAPHICS! AND ITS SO LIVELY!,5
Very addictive.,5
Fun to play,5
Its awesome One of the best,5
Good game,5
"Good gme, but it crashes everytime I log in so its virtually unplayable",2
Lots of fun,4
Funny and neat app,5
Great game,5
Very well thought out interface. Gameplay is addictive. The feel of this game is a combination of Clash of Clans and Diablo. Well done EA!,5
Good so far,5
Fun stuff,3
This game have nothing like the real dongeon keeper...only the red horny demon...,2
Fun little time killing game,5
A nice dk feel on the time based phone ganes we're used to,5
"Was a huge fan of the original and love the new one, hope they keep them coming!",5
"Won't just like clash of clans, BUT WITH MORE FUN",5
Haaaa gay,1
"Played this on the pc and loved it. This version is kinda lame.  Awesome graphics and sound,  and if they just made it a single player game it would be great.   Also,  huge battery hog, and hard to make sure it's off.",3
Good,5
I haven't put it down some I downloaded it,5
Love it!!! Takes to long to do much though.,5
I remember this game from years ago on pc. Still a great game!,5
A blast from the past,5
"Similar to other games but better somehow ! Graphics, narrator? Who knows",5
Good,5
This game rocks I just wish it would run better,5
Great game,5
Awesome,5
Not too many micro transactions! Like it.,5
Awesome,5
Bad added. Nuff said.,5
NICE,5
Great remake of an old game,5
Like this alot,5
Nice,5
overal fun to play,5
Total time waster,5
Sweet game i am haveing so much fun with it,5
Oh yes,5
This game is pretty fun,5
"Feels like the classic, lots of fun!",5
"I could probably give this game 4 stars if I could play it without shelling out money every so often so that I can progress. I used to love the old dungeon keeper PC game and I'm sure I'd enjoy this game as well. But I will not play it.  I decided a while ago that I would NOT support this ridiculous new game payment method. I'd be happy to pay $10 for this game if I could then be able to actually play it. I refuse to pay for items that only allow you to progress a short amount before needing to pay again.  If you're like me and hate this new game economy then STOP paying for the ability to play for a while and instead support companies that allow you to pay once for their app.  One of the options for buying gems in this game is for ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. That's absurd. Game designers who use this economy must not be able to sleep at night because people who pay hundreds of dollars to play games (and it happens all the time - look at Candy Crush) are clearly having an addiction response, nearly identical to a gambling addiction.",1
Good game so far :),5
Definitely play this.,5
..hell yes,5
Just like the classic,5
raiding and seeing others players unique dungeons and their creativity in layouts is what I enjoy,5
Nice,5
"I have never played the original, so I don't know what I missed.  Tried this, In App purchases had me  uninstalling right away.  I'm not a fan of freemium, I will not be nickel and dimed in a game.",1
I loved it before and I still love it now,5
I loved the original game and I'm thrilled to be able to play it again!  Cant wait to level up!,5
"Fantastic game, smooth to play, funny as well.",5
"RIDICULOUSLY expensive and impossible to play if you aren't continually opening your wallet. Nice try, EA, but I'll be uninstalling.",2
Awesome,5
i love this game,5
"Few bugs here and there, outside of that fairly addictive (supporting this game because I used to love the pc version of this 10 yrs ago)",5
"Great game, would have better if you didn't have to pay for so many of the upgrades",4
Reminds me of my childhood!,5
Good concept however the amount of time I've spent in load up screens and reconnecting destroys any chances of havimg any fun.  Also takes too long to get gems forcing you to buy them which won't fly on such a poorly executed game.,2
Would have gladly paid for the game up front. Ruined a classic. Installed after recent updating made it impossible to get anywhere,2
The first one is the most important part  Pickles,5
I havent cseen a decent dungeon to raid all day,4
"After the second-last update my game was wiped though still save in Google play. Game started a new one on it's own. Now I'll barely play for a minute or two before my Google play account will disconnect and once it loads the ""new game"" the whole thing will crash. Most recent update failed to have any affect on this.",1
Great fun but I think gems need to be cheaper or reduce the cost of extra workers,5
This game is good. It takes a long time to get stuff done because I refuse to spend real money on it. Sometimes it has glitches that reset to a previous save and you lose what your building or upgrading.,4
"Very fun game, keep upmthe good work.",5
For a free to play it is a fun game.,5
Fun game,5
Addictive gameplay.  It's a tower defense/offense with a comic evil dungeon theme,5
Its a good game that is a lot of fun. Gets expensive really fast. Way too expensive.,3
It's a fun game but very different from the PC version.,5
Love it,5
Good game lots of fun,5
Ok game,3
I played this game 15 years ago. Back to old time.  Beware imps are so expensive. Don't waste your money.,1
Soooooo glad DK's back!,5
Best game ever! Good for when bored.,5
Good game.,5
Awesomeness! Just great mindless fun with a bit of strategy and some luck thrown into the mix :)	Play it! Is fun!,4
"I'm down 150,000 $ gold cause the game goes into shutdown when u try to raid anything...u lose your summoned army the gold and when it auto restarts I get a brand new dungeon. Don't waste your time on this game...takes long enough to play but getting screwed on top of it. TERRIBLE GAME..this game crashes more than a drunk driver. I guess they missed out on all the talented computer geeks.",1
This brings me back. Nice update on the graphics.,5
Get this game better than pixel gun 3D,5
Good game,5
"Always room for improvment, please more options for getting crystals, way to go on a classic still ea luv the graphics!!!",5
This is the most awesome game continue your good works gentlemen.,5
Great time waster,5
Not bad.,5
Love this game.....,5
"This game brings me back, can't stop playing!",5
So much fun. Just try not to spend your gems. Save them for buying more minions,5
Great game loads of fun,5
Great game lots of fun,5
Is not working since the new up date,1
Awesome game. Nostalgic but currnet and accessible,5
Nice little game very addictive it misses some the immersion of the pc games and the price of the gems are to expensive,5
Takes me back,5
A fun an funny game. Worth playing.,5
Screen just goes black some times but gameplay is awesome.,4
Totally addicted but cost way to much for 3rd builder. Wish I could have played before it got raised by 300%.fix and I will give 5,3
Good game,5
Sweet,5
Love it,5
Works flawlessly on my HTC One. Very addicting.,5
So many old memoriess but im not im pressed. The build times? The gems? EA your a multi million dollar company. Stop pinching people. Dont give yourself the bad rep of being the p2w...,1
"Since the last update the game ""reconnects"" upon launch and takes me back to the beginning of the tutorial.",1
Game is ruined by gems.,1
Dungeon keeper is a PC classic that makes the jump to android in this highly playable mobile version.  An excellent in-game tutorial will get you started right away.,5
Needs more minions,5
Well designed and fun to play!,5
Great game to play,5
Good,4
This game iw quite good I'm having lots of fun,5
A blast to play,5
Fun love the dungeon style game play. Takes to long to dig tunnels imo. Reduce to 2 hours and 12 hours and it would be a lot better.,5
Great game very much like the origional,5
Love it!!!!,5
This game is a riot a hell of a lot more fun than any of the other seven games up there two evil pointy thumbs up,5
Wasssaaaap,5
A new twist on an old favourite! They actually managed to improve upon an already great game. Bravo!,5
This game is a long grind right from the start. Don't expect to come in here and max your dungeon out within a week and go on to dominate everyone in this game. It simply does not work today way. If you are patient you will do well to progress in this game. It is well worth the time.,5
"Starting to regret spending any money on this game... It crashes regularly, sometimes freezes the phone so reboot is needed.  Recently after a flash of my dungeon it seems to disconnect, then the game wants to start all the way from scratch...tried to use the in game review to comment that also does not work..takes one word per field/section  Email:com... Of course it tells me 'com' is not a valid email....  Fun game please get it working. Samsung galaxy s2",1
Good game play.  Not too easy. Not to hard.,5
"The game is good, however there was an update.  I could not opt out out and since then everytime I try to open the game I end up at the play store download for DK.  When I choose open the game loads then brings me back to the play store again.  The only good thing about this is that the uninstall option is right there.",2
Fantastic game,5
Great game,5
Fun,5
Reminds me of the classic pc game,5
Good game,5
It is great!,5
I hate this because of when I playing  another game the add sowes up,5
I could see myself playing this a lot.,5
"The game overall was smooth and all, just wish its not on Gem base. Feel like you cant do anything decent without them.",5
Addictive,5
Hello,5
"....is the gems. I think any/all players that mined rock that now has gems in it should be compensated for. I have mined basically the entire perimeter of my dungeon when the gem update came up, and I would really appreciate it I got gems for my (hard) work, effort and time put into doing so. Other than that and a reply back from you, I would rate this a 5 star. Thanks!",4
Goooooooddd,5
Best!,5
"Honestly, raising the cost of the 4th minion from 500 gems to 1.2k? Bullfrog is rolling over in its grave right now. Uninstall complete.",1
"Excellent game, drains battery though pretty badly.",4
Addictive,5
This game was OK  until the update - not great but ok. The increases to costs for leveling up are now out of control and take way too long without gem purchases. I am uninstalling now. Would rather have paid a one time fee to play.,1
Would be even better if this was exact port or the original PC style game,4
great game,5
Just as much fun as the original.,5
"Every morning, I make sure my imp gets a good smacking to get him going!",5
Nough said :P,5
Good concept but a one time fee would be great.,3
Love this game. Great graphics and cool characters.,5
Game,5
"Before the update, my next imp was 500 gems...now it's 1200...I was saving up and was close but now I have a loooong way to go. Thanks for that by the way.This was enough to give you a 1 until I get my 500 gem imp back.",1
"I never played the original, but I gotta say I really enjoy playing this so far :)",5
If you enjoy building and have a dark sense of humor you will enjoy it.,5
Awesome game,5
"The newest update seems to have erased my dungeon, just as I was reaching a spot in the leaderboards... things were pretty cool until then but I aint restarting",1
"Love this game, glad they made an app.",5
Just did an update for the New creature the Immortal. This update has reset my game. Weeks of work are gone.   I played the original DK when I was a teenager. I hope for the third to be resurrected from the developers floors.   though I am disappointed in many of the mechanics of this game and its actual gameplay(it is basically just like another game like it) I played it simply because of the universe it exists in and for a nostalgic feeling for my younger days. This game is horrid.,1
Game is fun but doesnt do the original any justice. I would gladly pay for a port of dungeon keeper 1 or 2,5
Great game but takes to long to build. Everything. Shorten build time please.,5
"The original games were fantastic, so it was awesome to find it on here. Very well adapted.",5
"I've been waiting for a game to come out to replace the original that will no longer play, and then this hits the app store! I love the way you stylised  this. It may be different in small aspects, but a fresh twist on this gruesome game. ;)",5
Weet,5
Good,5
Awesomely evilie fun,5
Restructuring cost of everything in-game? 4th imp goes from 500 to 1200 gems? And not even a notice on these changes with the new update?,2
"its good an all but the original is way more fun, cause u didn't have to pay for anything lol and also it didn't so looooong to do things, still a not bad game tho I guess",5
good pop in pop out game ... great graphics,5
Title says all,5
What a great throw back to an old classic,5
Ya,5
Yup,5
"Good, but hate the gems",4
"Good explanations... Gameplay is good, very enjoyable!",5
Tower defence andros all in one game.... Nice... No bugs,5
"Some occasional crashes,  but a fun game.  Attacks by other players aren't devastating enough to frustrate me out of playing.",5
This brings back memories! Prefer to buy the full game and have less wait times,5
Its fun and I like the graffics,5
"Excellent just as fun as the old one, definetly a must have",5
"Love this game, I still like dungeon 1&2 more",5
Not the same DK I played on pc but still love it,5
Lots of fun,5
After the latest update all of the building upgrades are 10 times more expensive all of a sudden. I was saving gold and stone for the upgrade of my graveyard and unholy temple but now its asking for millions of stones for the upgrade. Not playing anymore,1
good game,5
"The whole gems thing is stupid and way too expensive. After the last update, price for a new imp rises 300%. As well as costs for buildings. Takes waaaaaay too long to do anything in this game. 4 days to finish construction? Slang off EA. Thus game could have been awesome. It's not.",1
Sweet!,5
"But when you use an accelerator, such as Hola, the sound will work but the screen will blank out when it gets to the Connecting... Part of the initial loading screen and doesn't continue.",5
Great game.,5
Although I would never call it dungeon keeper... because it is not. There is hardly anything unique from dungeon to dungeon. And no innocent overworld folks...,2
Classic,4
Reminds me of many hours spent playing this originally on my first PC. Good game,5
Fun,5
"In a pay2win game, when ones' pay2win currency (gems, in this case) keep vanishing for no reason each time one logs in, there is a problem. I loved this game up until this. Goodbye DK. I miss your good ol' days",2
Good game that follows the classic favorite,5
Great mobile version of a classic,5
"The game is great and a good time killer only problem is that imps are so expensive,  800 for the third one really?",4
Great game,5
The game is really fun but it could do without in-game purchases to further your dungeon. A one time fee and rid of gems and adjusted build/dig times would get 5 stars without question,4
Great fun so addicting,5
Its fun but I wish that the digging didnt take so long. These p2w games are getting annoying,4
A friends list would be good like on simpsons tapped out.,4
Very fun game,4
Jusy as fun as when I played the PC version 15 years ago,5
I love it ... play it everyday :),5
Enjoyable for what it is. More so now that the frenzy is over and you can build before being constantly attacked.,4
Good game needs more types of rooms and when you take a way a wall you should be able to build there,5
Its an addictive game which is fun,5
Good way to pass my time,5
Fun stratgic game,5
Simply awesome guys kudos,5
Almost like the old PC game from the 90's. Lots of fun!,5
Loved the original game back in the day. Hooked on this one.,5
"An old game remastered beautifully, if only my imps would stop crying.",5
"Fun, even though its hugely turn and time based. Very quirky and awesome.",5
It reminds me of the original game but I would rather pay it once that have to use in app pay!!,4
I never played the originals but I find this game is fantastic and very enjoyable. It's aimed at those who just want to play quick spurts of a few minutes and it accomplishes this very well. It keeps me coming back for more! Keep it up!,5
Love this game. Just wish it were easier to get gems,4
Great fun. I like the whole theme of being dungeon keeper and the art and stuff. Thanks :) hope to see updates in the future,5
Can't do much unless you pay. Buggy. Can't turn off notifications.,3
Great gameplay!,5
"Something closer to the original game would have been a lot more enjoyable, this is hardly a RTS...",3
"Great game. However you can't progress In  the game. Glitch reboots app everytime you win  a battle. Going to uninstall game. Couldve been good game, Catered to older gamers who loved this genre of game. Wish it worked properly.",3
Great,5
This game is awesome,5
Good gamee,5
I wish this game had the possess spell but other then that it is amazing.,5
Good graphics a couple bugs but fun game,4
Awesome,5
"Its fun. Not as good as the original dungeon keeper, but then what is?",4
Add friend's option,4
Nice game,5
Reminds me a lot of the pc game I love but it is not nearly as fun due to the long wait times(unless you pay for in game jems). A one time fee version would be the way to go!,3
√ÄaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaawsomm,5
"Barely playable. Everytime you go for a raid, when you almost complete, it reconnects and you lost all loots and your army!",1
And I enjoy this mobile version but this pay for resource cash grab is horribly frustrating and poorly thought out. Please get rid of this system! I would gladly play for a decent version of this game.,2
Love the game very exciting and great graphics.,5
Takes too long,2
"This game is very well made, easy to pick up impossible to put down",5
Good game. Guy sounds like Tim curry,5
Love it,5
I like the mix they have been able to make,4
Wait times can be long but set your imps to digging or building while you go to work or sleep and check in on them now and again and your dungeon will be deadly in no time.,4
I've played the original DK from Bullfrog and this is an excellent port. If it comes out as a sequel without the time build and gems factors I would certainly purchase it.,3
"Fun game. But requires constant connection to the internet. Thanks for that one ea, you know us so well. *rolls eyes*	Would be 4 star if no internet requirement",3
"I've got better things to do than slap imps every 30 minutes. Also, was saving for ages just to get the 800 gems for a third imp, but accidentally tapped a booster and lost weeks worth of effort. I'm not spending the $5 to recover the gems, so uninstalling.",1
Impressionnant,5
I would have rated it a 4.5 but it keeps crashing.  This is especially annoying when you are raiding because you loose all your troops and don't get any of the resources you plundered.  PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!!,1
Enjoying the heck out of this,5
"Love the game.  I would have definitely bought the game if it was a paid game, but paying for gems?  You have to be stupid to sink money into a game like this or tapped out with the donuts lol",5
It is a pretty good game.  Figuring out defense and offensive strategies is fun.,4
Just like the original but with better graphics,4
"Essentially? Meh, chibi version on a nostalgic game. Once you hit a week or two of playing, everything takes a day or two to build or upgrade. But impatience asside, the game itself runs pretty smoothly.",3
Enjoyable and a fun way to wile away a few minutes at a time.,5
Addictive,4
Good game,5
Its great fun for killing time,4
"Didn't stay true enough to the original for my tastes. Notifications were annoying.   On a whole, not what I feel was represented in the description.",2
Fun game just like the classic well not exactly but just as good,5
Thanks,5
Crashes on startup.,1
Sweet game,5
Its good,5
Buggy,3
"Good game, enjoying it. Things take way too long. Only negative I've found.",4
Pop ups won't stop,1
Still miss the original game. Not a bad job. I would like more single player/less reward for wait time.,4
Cant connect!,1
"Great way to pass time. Has a lot of the feel of the original games, but isn't as fun. Waiting times get quite long at certain points. Defending your dungeon against the AI should be ""good heroes"" instead of more minions.	Would love a single player version akin to the original games with no pay2play model, just a one time fee.",4
"The game is fine, but mostly it reminds me of the old PC games. EA, please bring back Dungeon Keeper to PCs or fine some way to stabilize 1 & 2 for Windows 7. Thank you :)",3
Don't like the paid time management and pay for resources. Ruins what could be a great game. Then again EA is great at ruining games so...,1
"They take forever to fix issues and when I redownloaded this game my progress was wiped, and all the gems i spent disappeared. Than I went to create a new dungeon I was moving around the map when it suddenly went balistic. This game is an innovative waste of money, megabytes, and time. I am disgusted that this was called dungeon keeper and should have been called wallet rapist tower defence",1
"Recently, the raid percentages are calculating incorrectly (ie: destroy everything, only get rated at 63%, or get 1 star and 60%, then get rated as 23% defeat).  Also experiencing crashes lately.  Fix these, and I'll rate 5",2
:),3
Enjoyable and funny,5
"I love the narrator's comments! Language may be a little much for kids, but I'm not a kid üòÅüôå. Excellent, job well done and a great game!",5
Ive play the originals on my pc and I have to say this is a kick@$$ remake for cellphones.,5
"N7 2013... Three times I've tried to scroll past different items in the shop and the game recognized a tap, causing me to spend a huge chunk of gems. The last time it took all but 85 of the gems I'd saved up for weeks. Uninstalling.",1
Just like PC there's no difference,5
"It may not be the 90's Dungeon Keeper many remember fondly, it has much of the same feel. However, this is much more of a tower defense game. Wait times for your imps to accomplish certain things can be a bit excessive, and it's obvious the reason this game is free is because EA is trying to push their micro-transactions down everyone's throat. It's possible to play this game without spending real money on in-game currency (gems), but be prepared to wait. Still a very fun game, despite the pandering.",3
Love it!,5
Pretty fun,4
Almost as good as the original! Love it,5
"I have two problems with this game overall.  Number one, the graphics for my tablet lack alot of detail compared to my phone and I must note that I have a galaxy 3 phone and tablet. The rooms are showing upnas a bright blue while the walkways are the correct color. I'm also having problems with the touch response. When I go into the store to buy more traps or rooms the game won't allow me to scroll from side to side. This is very dissapointing to me. Is this game the same on all tablets or did i get jipped?",4
This is so awesome! There should be more games like this!,5
I played the original games when I was younger and ticked they didn't continue with the third but this is a great reminder of my youth. Slapping minions has never been funner,5
I love it,5
"I understand everyone needs to get paid but at least put a paid version instead of these expensive crystals that are essential to play the game if   you don't have days to wait, disappointed coming from original DK 2 fan. Please put out simple paid version",2
"Ugh, no",1
"Games fun, nothing bad to say at all! Drop in and raid a dungeon!",4
Great game,5
It would be nice if you got a grace period of no attacks at the beginning,4
Wish I could find friends and contacts from Google+,4
Good game same as most build army attack rebuild. Different layout keeps it interesting.,4
PVP matchmaking is very lopsided. Lacks the humor of the original. Very slow and monotonous.,3
"These games are all the same. Its fun for a while but when you want to go very far it wants you to pay for a currency that only exists if you pay cash.  I like the dungeon keeper games, but the fact that EA took this game and made it into a money grab, totally disappoints me.  3 stars to the dungeon keeper series being on android",3
Fun,5
It's a decent game but takes time long to get anywhere which in turn makes it less fun.,2
I had hoped for a moment that this might be dungeon keeper. But it was every other backyard monster like Facebook game. With the theme of dungeon keeper. Sadly that is not for me at all.   If you guys make a real game I can buy once. I will do so.  Also. Nice job on the controls and graphics. Good job there.,1
Great reboot of a classic from the past. Little buggy though,4
Played this game when I was younger and have been so bummed that they never made another one and they have. Yay!  Thank you!,5
"It has a pretty good feel, with a great ip tied into it. Can't wait to see how it plays",4
Fun game two play.,5
Good game but real slow to play if you don't fork out some cash to buy gems,3
I started it up and my game of several days was apparently gone - I was stuck in the tutorial.  Uninstalled.,1
"Very smooth, excellent for a casual but still immersive experience",5
Fun,5
EVERY SINGLE TIME you log the app asks you to accept the Google plus thing. And I've turned off the game notifications but it still shows them. I'll play when I'm ready thank you very much!!!!!!!!,3
Well designed with many components and a variety of different ways to approach each battle. Keeps you wanting more!,5
I used to play this game with my buddy something like 15 years ago.  I am loving this updated version.,4
Not as good as the original but fun aspects of multiplayer,5
Almost as good as the original,5
"Just crashed during the MIDDLE of a RAID! After a day of replay crashes that brings this game down 3 *! Not much left to loose EA, why not go for the last one and the uninstall by crashing during a purchase?!? Edit: can't even START  a raid now! Uninstalled!",1
"The game overall is an enjoyable time waster. However, the price for gems is despicable. In this case, it is not good to be bad; and as we know, EA is bad. They have the nerve to include a $99.99 price point on a ridiculously small amount of gems. EA, we all know you for the company that you truly are; the fancy suited, $800 sunglasses and $1200 shoes type, but put some thought into your prices and the quality of the product you make. Release a full version for a fixed price and maybe people will respect",3
"Love this game.  Lots of easy,  go at your own pace fun",5
Keeps me interested!,5
Evil is good!!,5
Will try to download update. Downloads the file but doesn't stop at 27mb. Goes to 33mb then crashes,2
"This game, yet very similar to clash of clans and clash is just fanfriggentastic! I personally think thats its much better than those other two. Good job EA and Mythic XD",5
"Overall the game plays really well and it's alot of fun, but the whole gems thing just seems to slow down gameplay",4
Awesome,5
"This is an amazing blend, cloud based but hasn't lost the traditional style of game play. Similar to the first game available on PC. A truly wonderful game and welcome addition. 5 Stars!!",5
Best game ever on android!!!!,5
Give us the full game not micro-transactions of it...,1
Good,4
"Fun and competitive. My only complaint so far it that it's really difficult to laterally scroll through the menus. If that gets fixed, it'll be an easy 5 stars.",4
"Brings back fond memories of the PC version, played years ago!",5
+1,5
"The game is really fun! Good graphics. BUT!!!, It looses connection at times, which sucks. Notifications wont turn off!! I hate them gems... I would rather buy the game without them.",3
"At first glance this game looks and sounds like Dungeon Keeper.  Then you slowly start to realize the sad truth, that this is NOT Dungeon Keeper.  Rooms have set sizes, dungeons are small, your army is tiny, it's nothing more than a boring tower defence game, and NO CONTROLLING YOUR MINIONS!!  Seriously, this was the best part of the game.  You could jump into any minion and do the job yourself.  Not any more.  Now you just watch your minions sit in their room while the rest of your dungeon is destroyed.  And despite how much I level up my dungeon, or load it up with traps and minions, I still get crushed every single raid.  And aside from the crashes and losing your army after a raid, the biggest screw you to all the die hard fans of the past is the greedy in game purchases to do pretty much anything within your lifetime.  Gotta love how you can buy other games for a couple bucks but games like this could cost you over $100 just to be able get anywhere soon.  Thanks for nothing EA!  Update:  Major bug!  Started the game and went to someone else's dungeon!?!  Could have had some fun with it but just exited the game and tried again.  Seriously!?!?",1
Fun and quirky!,5
Good game.,5
Fun for the patient,3
Wish it kept truer to the pc version campaign and whatnot tho ..and wait times are getting a little long..almost to the boredom stage .. but still a GREAT classic game!,4
Would be 5* if it was a truly free game but fun nonetheless,4
Can't stop playing.... this is great,4
Am excellent remake of the original. I haven't been able to put it down! :-),5
"Very polished game, I like it a lot. It sometimes crashes on start-up and it occasionally will click on parts of the dungeon when I mean to swipe or move around. Other than that it's all good.",5
Awesome! Nostalgia rush!,5
So happy that EA has done a modern refresh to this great game.,5
"Good game, fun to play. Different style of tower defense. But still awesome and fun",5
Money grabbing piece of sht. Better of playing the original DK or DK2.,1
Interesting,5
Works well enough but would have been better if stuck to original's moody atmosphere and dark sense of humor. Cartoony reboot misses the point.,3
I would have gladly shelled out  money for the original version of the game for mobile. You took Bullfrog's masterpiece and murdered it. This is not Dungeon Keeper. It just pretends to be. If you are a fan...prepare to spend money making an imp dig. Yes you heard me right.,1
Cool game tobad the jems run out fast.,5
"Not good. Has none of the charm or abilities as dungeon keeper. The minions are mindless and lost, rooms are just bundled together, imps or worthless....did any of the developers play dungeon keeper, or just look at screenshots??",1
Best mobile game experience so far! Really enjoying this,5
Excellent time killer. Keeps you interested and intrigued. Love the humor. Must have for everyone :),5
I was hoping it would be more like the original.. I would rather have a 1 time fee than ability to but gems..,3
Great game,5
Awesome!,4
I was a bit worried that a handheld version of Dungeon Keeper was going to be a colossal disappointment.... it is not! While it does play differently to the PC games this version does have a certain charm to it. Well done EA. 5 stars,5
"Great game,  would be really nice if it was easier to fill in spots with dirt. Also in the middle of a raid it will also disconnect,  and I'll lose all my minions.  Paid for some gems but isn't actually really necessary like it is in some game.",3
It's just designed to suck money out of you. Virtually unplayable. Would have been a fun game if it just came with a 5$ price tag and they didn't make it impossible to play without paying absurd amounts for gems.,1
Fun game,5
Booya!,5
"I wish this was the same as the pc, you've changed too much, it is no longer the game I loved. Why would you do such a thing? Still not bad in its own rights though",3
Great game,4
Typical EA bs. Can't connect for some reason so it won't let me play offline. They also want access to my Google+ account and all my contact info. Screw you EA!,1
"Probably a good game.  I remember the original being great.  Why does EA require a Google Plus account, though?  Past experience tells me to never trust them.  Uninstalled.  Sorry, Mythic.",1
keeps on kicking me out when I try gto run the app ...,2
Smooth and smart fun game,5
A must play.,5
I enjoyed this game years ago on my PC and was crazy excited when I saw its been revamped! Lost many hours to this game and plan on losing even more!! Awesome!!,5
Another money grabber. Pay up or watch everything take forever. Absolutely no fun if you want to play but not pay.,1
Funny... Entertaining.... Overall great game... Only gripe is a small one... Rubble being a day to remove.......is way to much... 8 - 12 h max would be much better,4
I hate it,1
"This would be a great base building game, however for some reason it keeps losing connection even if I am right beside the router. Once that happens it will either try to reconnect and say the game is being played on another device, or it could reload the whole game!",3
"Funny sex references, and a great voice over. The gameplay is fun too",5
Supah fun!,5
Good game,5
Since I downloaded it has been unable to connect to server with error 17.,1
A good mobile game based off the original.,4
Just as fun as the original. Great graphics and gameplay,5
Wow. I remember playing this on PC years ago. Thanks EA!,4
Great game worth my time,5
Awesome,5
"I like the concept, but the pathway starting layout could have been a little better. Fun though.",4
Nothing like the original game,1
"Pretty much what you'd expect from an EA mobile title. Only thing similar to the original DK is the voice actor. Everything else is micro transactions. If you feel like spending $100 on a video game, I'm sure it would be more enjoyable... But why would you?",2
I love it,5
I love this game. I only wish it were easier to get the gems.,5
Great game lots of fun and addicting  played computer version and like this as much,5
A must have for fans of the original PC versions. Only complaint is that the game stops responding if you accidentally lock/turn off your phone while playing.,4
Amazing,5
i cant play it!!,1
Stuck at the early levels of the tutorial where I don't have enough stone to upgrade and raid phooeys dungeon. Clicking anywhere does not work.,2
"Do everyone a favor, slap a minion today :p",4
Not like the other dungeon keeper games. Also will nickel and dime you to death. Just like every other build and wait game.,1
"Other then the odd restarts when I'm in the middle of an attack that costs me the troops and any resource gain, it's pretty fun.",4
"Game is buggy.  Offers no real depth beyond every other social game, but then disconnects you randomly and says it's being used on another device.  Not worth your time.",2
Takes too much time to wait in between upgrades,3
This brings me back to when I was a young dungeon keeper! Excellent game and an amazing next step in the series!!,5
"I enjoy this more than the other clash of clans type games, mainly because since this is a dungeon setting so it's much easier to herd your opponents into your area of choice. Also the evilicious voice over makes this game so much better. I would like to see a storage for traps and rooms because right now it is very hard to redecorate the dungeon once you run out of space.",4
Fun,4
Awesome game!,5
Its alright,4
Its ok,3
Tbh would be five star if imps didnt cost so much. Maybe ten bucks to get lasr three imps would be fair,4
I like the game play and challanges it gives,4
Great game,5
"Yup, that's the highlight for me. Otherwise, it's a pretty good tower defense/offense game. And the wait time really makes it feel like you're building a dungeon.",4
Just can not put it down since getting this game.,4
Pretty addictive,4
"Love it, it's easy, fun, and a good way to kill time! mwahahahaha lol",5
Just get it u will luv it,5
This game is the very best of free to play in app purchase games. The original game was amazing and this game has the same feel the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars would be an in app purchase to remove the gems from the game replacing them with gold or stone. This game is a must have for anyone that loved the original or anyone looking to try something a little more evil!,4
"Great game, better than other mindless ones",5
Awesome for my moblie fun,4
Have to get this one if u liked old school pc dk            L,5
Classic game brings back alot of memories,5
"I'm now able to actually win battles without the game reloading, but now it randomly closes for no reason.",1
Kind of slow loading but well worth it,5
Awesome,4
Good fun,5
Be better if you just paid for the game straight out instead of having these ridiculous wait times to get anything done. Really takes away from the enjoyment of the game.,2
"Well done and well put together, good job EA and Mythic.",5
Good stuff,5
"It's an entertaining game, but it's really a pay to win game, with HUGE bonuses available for purchase.   Without spending money on it's currency, you cannot get more Imps (Construction workers) and that slows the game down to unplayable levels. With the huge bonuses available to buy in game, the developer doesn't even HINT that you can succeed without paying.",2
Wickedly fun ... and ... is that Clancy Brown? \m/ \m/,5
"A good mobile gaming interpretation of one of my favourite series, but the microtransactions kill the mood.",4
I like this game a lot. So much fun,5
If you played this game 4 pc then you will love the android version,5
Dang fun!,5
Awesome   Awesome,5
"Odd, takes some time to start up, but i play it passive as i do other things",3
Would love if I could just buy it out right instead of paying for gems etc. Great game otherwise.,4
Great game if u liked DK not pay to win just pay to save time,5
Great game,5
"For a mobile port, this is a great game.  The original was far more entertaining, mainly because of the pay for resources concept, but for those that never experienced the""Horny"" goodness of the original, then this game is a definite must!",4
"This game seems like it will be decent enough whenever I actually get to play it. The tutorial is much too long ( which would be fine if it were optional)  I want to play the game, not spend 20 minutes clicking where it tells me to click.",2
Not like the original dk but not horrible,3
Good game.,5
It works:-) now you can raid and plunder at will :-),5
I fondly remember the PC version.,4
"Invested a wweek and now it lags to load crashes and rooms are blue (unskinned). You're better off finding open source versions of the original online for your pc.  Loved the original, but these pay for resource games take too much time out of the playing of the game. Just far too tedious.  Could be better if I could buy the game for ten dollars and just play!  I hate that you can't control the attackers, wasting your paid for resources on poor ai desicisions.  Would be way more fun if I wasn't waiting four hours to play for five minutes.",2
Ya know all the other games I said were the best this one beats it I love keeping a dungeon and raiding other dungeond,5
"Dungeon Keeper is remade for mobile, and it is just as addictive as the computer version. As with all mobile games there is the occasional glitch (all-black sprites once in awhile) but otherwise I'm finding a very smooth and fun gaming experience. Good job guys!!",4
The only thing I would change is that I wish there was a way to play offline.,4
Every bit as fun as it's ancestral namesake for the PC.  Was always a fan of the genre. Happy to see it revived.,5
Please fix the crashing after raids problem. Other than that it is an awesome game.,2
Still a little lacking on the true dungeon keeper game. Also im having issues with the game. When i win a raid i do not get any resources or combat points. Please fix.,4
Really like it and I think it's got great potential. It's fun and fresh. But just some work that needs to be done to polish it off.,4
The enjoyment of the game is marred heavily by in app purchases that can easily imbalance the game and having your dungeon under constant assault from other players. That wouldn't be so bad if the game's combat system seemed to work correctly as I'm not quite sure how an enemy having all of their minions destroyed and not attacking my dungeon heart or storage rooms gets a 100% victory. Not worth the install.,1
It crashes when I try to open the game... sent in a report. Hope you can fix it.  I have an xperia arc.,1
"Get game glad I found it, would recommend it to anyone and everyone",5
Good game better then I thought it would be,4
"For what this game has to offer, it is well made, very similar to all the other games out there today in that it is all real time building, having to wait hours for tasks to finish to start new ones. But my only real complaints are, gems are not easy to come by to get more minions and two, the crash/freeze/restart bug when raiding. After a raid is done, no matter the mode, the app usually restarts itself with the outcome of the raid canceled, no loot, no replays, yet have to resummon all my monsters.",3
Great game! What makes it great is that it is dungeon keeper. I really enjoyed the game growing up. Dungeon Keeper 3 maybe?,5
come out with the 2nd one too pleeeaaaasseeee!!!!!??!!!! <3,5
Just started playing DK after years of having played it on PC. Awesome job EA!,5
There are bugs that make advancing in the game impossible. Seemed fun to play but pointless until they are fixed.,1
Very entertaining,5
Good concept but it keep disconnecting... usually just in that small time between when you finished a raid and when you collect the rewards for it. Fix the bug and I'll revise.,2
"Cool, love the imps!!!?",5
Game crashed 3times when entering the game but 4th time worked. I still think the PC version was better,3
Decent,4
"An interesting take on Dungeon Keeper - it's actually quite fun, although it's definitely a different flavor from the original.   It's pretty well polished. And the multiplayer aspect can be minimal if you choose to not participate (minimum 1 attack / 12 hours)  The most annoying problem is that it's quite easy to accidentally spend the premium currency (gems).  A few areas have proper warning prompts but most of the game will allow gem spending with a single click.",4
Awesome,5
A classic game now available for mobile devices! Awesome!,5
"Dungeon Keeper was my favourite game of my childhood. Its great that EA has finally brought some life back to the series, but this is not like the game I remember, and I miss it. Its alright, but they just knocked off the Clash of Clans style gameplay. Dungeon Keeper was a game completely original and like no other, why change it to copy something else when it already was something incredible and unique!? It atleast makes me smile and brings back old memories. I would like to see Dungeon Keeper 3 on PC!",3
"As soon as I finish a really good raid and loot a ton of resources, the game restarts completely and says ""checking for updates"" this is really frustrating as this has happened 5 Times already and I was not rewarded with my loot AND I lost the creatures I used during the raid! 1 star until fixed. BTW RELAUNCHING DOES NOT WORK.",1
"Good defense game, waiting for the catch.",4
"Game was good, but can no longer raid or do missions without it restarting.",3
Game play is very addictive !!!,4
Runs great on the S4. So far its fun and cant argue with free to at least try it out,5
I loved the original and I love this game more. Easy to pickup and play. ...you find yourself going to check your dungeon all day. Bravo dev team....great job as always.,5
"I also loved the PC games growing up and was looking forward to trying this app.  First 2 starts I had to back out due update downloads not stopping after the total was exceeded.  #1 reset my phone when I quit.  Next few attempts I got to the G+ account choice to login with and it wouldn't accept my current account.  Standard EA tripe to this point, I don't even want to see the game now.",1
Games is good. nice graphics and such. EA's always online problem is bad. it always loses connection for me. i 70% of my battles i win i dont get the rewards or experience. but i do lose all the men the i built 100% of the time. Game is cool but Greedy EA sucks the big one. EA = Ruins Huge titles + Zero support for fans,2
"I played the pc games to death growing up and to see this game available as a phone app is really awesome. And I like that all microtransactions are there for ease, not for winning. More games like this please... And make DK3 for pc!",5
So far everything has been pretty top notch and is quite good. Good gameplay and great graphics.,5
I love dk,5
I would have given it 4 stars if I don't see the reconnect message every couple mins. And 5 stars if I dun list my progress 5 our of 7 times I finished a raid...,2
"I loved the orig games! This is different but so far so good, thanks for bringing it back! Make a new pc version lol",4
Awesome game loved as a child love it now,5
Not like the old game at all. But same characters and buildings.,5
Loads to do.,5
I was very excited to try this app out since I loved the PC versions of the game. But from the moment I tried to run this game all it gave me was grief. It took two days for the updates to load because the app would just close out half way through the update. When it finally did finish the update the app would go to the connection screen and then just close out suddenly. I tried clearing it's memory cash and running it again but it totally crashed my phone that time. I had to pull the battery AND memory.,1
"No offline play, You need to buy gems for everything (in game transactions), Sorry but the old DK was amazing without being greedy n I didn't have to be always online to play it, n so they wonder why Angry Birds still on #1. Gave it a few days to play but nope, uninstalled as of now.",2
Fun remake of a classic,5
Fun twist on a classic!,4
Takes a lot of time to build resources with out gems and you chew threw them fast but a decent game so far,4
Simply awesome,5
Pales in comparison to the original. Takes a long time to really do anything and all rooms have a set size. Makes me miss the old games,2
Loved dk when it came out. The mobile version is good too. Noticed a few glitches though. After I've cleared an event dungeon the game sometimes lags and reloads. Then it reboots itself.  The cluck off spell glitches sometimes and it doesn't seem to let me tap some enemies. These are minor things that I'm sure will get taken care off in the next few updates.  Still can't deny that it's a fun fun game,3
Thanks for the quick reply to connection issue. The game is pretty good so far!,4
Drains the phone juice fast but fun to play.,4
"I love this game on pc, now they have it again, very cool. Lot of fun.  And I am already hooked again. Thank you for your amazing and recreating this game.",5
"I used to play Dungeon Keeper a lot on PC, unfortunately the Android version just isn't the same. Graphics are good, but overall game play isn't enjoyable.",2
such as signing in with Gmail/Google+ to to follow my game habits? And online only to play? Isn't this a single player game? Do I like questions? Pass.,1
Played through fist little raid then it froze. New Samsung s4. After first dungeon it won't let me exit bunk bunk and more bunk.  It was getting I interesting	Bunk froze after the first dungeon,1
Great game want to keep playing it to its fullest extent but can't do that because it reloads every time I complete a mission or raid. Please fix,5
Keeps on crashing after the loading screen,1
Crashed early when trying to enter dungeon name.,2
70% of the time I raid. I get no profit and lose my army. Plz fix,5
Update: the game reloads after attacking and doesn't give rewards.  fun game with a huge bug,1
"Similar to the 1990's dungeon keeper 1 & 2 I'm happy to see this come to android.  Imps should auto collect gold though, and obtaining more imps to work should cost just gold.... developer should play the original dungeon keepers and adapt that game play for one of the best games of pc in the 90's",5
Keeps resetting after finishing campaign battles. I lose minions but don't get any loot even though I'd won,2
Stalled on loading screen on first try. Crashes randomly. Game lagged and some how caused me to spend all my gems on some buff that is useless when starting. Uninstalled after 8 hours. I'll try it again in a few months but for now it's a big no.,1
This game is an awesome experience..it would  be even better with more traps /creatures.lol,5
"Its more about nostalgia , but still It s not bad .",4
"Every time I raid dungeons, it doesn't display victory/loss but goes back to my dungeon without getting any loot or anything even though I beat it. Fix this asap ease.",2
Crashing on my phone.  Nexus S seems too puny to run.  Does say optimized for tablets so not upset.,1
