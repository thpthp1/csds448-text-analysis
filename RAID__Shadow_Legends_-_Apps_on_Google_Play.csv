Christopher Dicks,"April 26, 2021","Graphics are great, gameplay is fun. However, the constant and immediate pop ups as soon as the game loads to buy packs that I already know exist destroys any interest I had for playing this game and I've only had it for 7 days.

Ice DCUO,"April 18, 2021","This latest fusion event has shown us how Plarium feels about their players. We have lives. People who work 50-60 hours a week, have a family, ect. We literally have to spend every minute of our free time in the game. It's a chore. It's a grind (which is expected for a fusion) but they keep spiking ...

Sonny H.,"April 12, 2021","One of the best games on mobile. If you like looter games, and progression games. Reason for 3 stars is the prices og shop is ridicules, 400 dkk and you get so little for it, like stuf that saves you 10-30 minutes of grind. .. To compare, a brand new game just relesed would cost 600-700 dkk, and in ...

Vytautas Brundza,"April 12, 2021","Been playing on and off for almost a year. To sum up - this game is a poorly paid full time job with unpaid overhours. Finish every daily quest, do events and tournaments, find an active clan, for some time my laptop buzz day and night farming dungeons, so that I dont loose any energy. The result? I...

Evan Wade,"April 24, 2021","Too much F'ing RNG. You have RNG for what you pull from shards, dungeons, pots, books. All the while all these actions cost energy that at 16 attempts a try doesn't seem much but when you typically only have 100 or so energy it's a lot. Then say you get mad lucky with a piece of gear there's RNG on ...

MK Rose,"April 21, 2021",Not free to play friendly (or even low spend). After 2 months of daily playing you hit a wall in the arena which is the most important part of the game because it allows you to level up your Great Hall. Also the game takes on average 4 hours a day to grind content.
Tegan Blank,"April 17, 2021","Raid is a really fun game, but it is very clear that they do not care about their main playerbase. All you have to do is look at the reddit for it and you can see why month after month (especially recently) they have not only ignored their main playerbase, but made new events and changes that active...

Sam,"April 16, 2021","This Brogni fusion event is so ridiculous. I'm an end game player, and have played for over a year, and I'm still finding it incredibly hard to meet these ridiculous goals. I can't even imagine what it's like for the early/mid game players who actually need Brogni more than anyone. This entire month...

Jesse Lawrence,"April 8, 2021","Love the turn based rpg concept. Its refreshing to play a mobile rpg that focuses on individual characters(like an actual rpg) instead of base building. The arena needs to be changed, and ruins most of whats good about this game. My mission progress has been halted for months, despite adding a treme...

Daniel Harling,"April 9, 2021","Game play is fun, the event are most definitely pay to win as you an only get near the top of the stands if you want to put money out to get there. The character selection when opening shards is not random at all. Seems like you are stuck with 40% of the characters and don't get anything else. I too...

thomas radmanovich,"April 23, 2021","Arena is back to being broken and Playrium doesn't think it is. Having systems like great hall and missions attached to it is ludicrous. Players are sitting in the lower brackets that are unable to gain traction in either of these. It would take them weeks to get one upgrade in great hall. Take them...

PRNightmare86,"April 11, 2021","Never had a problem w this game until a few days ago, spent $ on this to get nothing in returned. They took my money to tell me I spent it on something that wasn't what I purchased. Played for over a year straight just to unlock characters and purchased other deals w no problems. Feel like they mess...

Pirate Grone,"April 27, 2021","Loved it, now it just seems like you have to play 24/7 for achievements I created a clan for more and better play but it is not what I expected limited calm battling and achievements should be available more also the game should penalize you for putting effort into it but the game decides the out co...

Marvin Grande,"April 20, 2021","I have been playing for over a year and while the game is fun, it's impossible to progress without spending serious money. Very expensive, NOT FREE TO PLAY FRIENDLY. Worth a download but expect to never compete later in the game unless you drop a lot of money."
StarjunV V,"April 15, 2021","Plarium wasted the potential of this game. After mid game you wont have any feeling of being rewarded for your efforts. Their game have way to much tings to fix, they know it and yet they do nothing.No arena fix, silver fix, books fix, dupe fix and rewards pass midgame are garbage. Their analitics p...

Amber Magni,"April 9, 2021","It's a really great game to play. I spend hours playing it with my daughter. We have alot of FUN. I had a glitch and had lost one of my armor pieces and they were so helpful with letting me know they would look into it. The next day they asked and I let them know exactly what it was and they had it ...

Brandon,"April 18, 2021","This game has a good support staff. And it's like other strategy RPG games I play. The main reason to why I don't give this game 5 stars is the fact that the game has alot of popup inapp purchases. Every time you log in there is about 5+ pop-ups and anytime you close from a thing you're doing on the...

Winslow Holloway,"April 9, 2021",I really like the game. I wish they had a tutorial in the beginning to teach you how to properly lvl up fights so that you can start on the good foot and I wish they would adjust their fighter algorithm. We get screwed a lot even after spending money.
James C Fattu,"April 29, 2021","Warning: these devs hate FTP players. My fav game for 2 years NOW TURNS MY STOMACH. I'm so mad and disgusted with these repeatedly manipulative practices through game events and ads that I am going back to consoles. I played hardcore ftp (sometimes spending for energy to play more... that's ridiculo...

Turntridge Plays,"April 28, 2021","The arena situation is getting to the point where I'm almost ready to call it quits with this game. How are we supposed to fight full legendary max geared teams in bronze? With only 4 possible rankings you are forcing people new and old to try and compete with the most brutal setups possible. Why wo...

Ric Dragon729,"April 19, 2021","Is a very good and well designed. Being free to play in this game does mean slow progression. I would not expect to be at the top of the leader board within a week if you not gonna pay money. I have 2 accounts and you can play either way with progression just faster to pay. New champions are consist...

B. Furphy,"April 22, 2021","Game was fun until they decided to ""improve"" the Arena....wait...nope they trashed it. Garbage! When you are in the top tiers you get a world bonus to your attributes that help with the other aspects of the game. Devs destroyed the Arena and at the same time ruined the entire game for those that nee...

anthony troya,"April 16, 2021","Im NOT doing this event. Nor spending any money whatsoever in game DURING the event. This appears a HUGE try on a cash grab, even to the point of intentionally making it this exact way in order to make low or f2p spenders open their wallets. Now granted. These games are ALWAYS cash grabs. But lately...

Wesley Roebuck,"April 13, 2021","VERY FRUSTRATED. Recent events for 'free' champs and the already difficult fusions are effectively impossible unless you spend $hundreds$ to buy shards each time. The game also requires absurd amounts of time just for daily activity. Sad because the game is fun, but very poor value for money. If I s...
