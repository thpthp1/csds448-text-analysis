review
"I love this game, graphics 10/10, gameplay is fun and easy to strat, but having to sign up to a Nintendo account just to keep your process is kinda pointless to do. I said I signed up later, forgot and now all my data is gone. I recommend to the creators, to have it already saved to my account. this happened to me was because too much storage and when I organized it i wanted to reinstall it"
"This game used to very fun and generous to players and I was more than happy to spend money. However, recently the game has implemented some very underhanded tactics to force people to spend. I do NOT recommend starting this game now. The best times for this game are long gone due to the developer's greed."
I think I would have liked playing...but it made my tablet extremely HOT! Had to uninstall!
"It's an amazing game, I just couldn't drop it when I started playing, the gacha system is incredible and the plot is great I also love the characters but the reason it is not getting five stars is because I honestly wish I could have been told a way to restore game data because I accidentally uninstalled the game and had to start all over again from the first chapter which sucks in my opinion, other than that the game is great"
"Really really great game, the pull rates are nice, we get tickets for summoning every now and then, the story is pretty interesting too. But I only give it a 4 because unlocking the story is a bit tedious, you always have to level up the Halidom and level up the Smithy before you unlock the story, as well as your own island"
Cute and awesome game
Love playing it n the story is so interesting
I like thank switch to different with different personally and dragon and the stories
Great gacha game Progress just requires being active Fun and gets updates Entertaining story Does as advertized in the app store

This game has a lot to do and is a lot of fun!
"After fixing up some things, the game runs really well! Gameplay is really fun and easy!"
This was my favorite game back then and it's still good
"Awesome gameplay with tons of content, fun and even engaging writing, and (most importantly) it's generous with its gacha currency both in game, and from the developers. Edit: two years later and this is still true. The main story's gotten kind of stupid, but the side and character stories are still good. Tons of QoL updates, too."
Another great gacha game! I love running my character in the missions and the fact that this game has co-op is just superb.
"This game is incredible, especially when compared to others of its kind. I am writing this review in response to one of the other reviewers. If you crash while you are summoning, you still get everything from that summon. It will not play the animation again, but if you check your summoning history or inventory, what you recieved from summoning will be there. The game takes many measures to ensure a high quality, intuitive experience. If you are lagging/crashing, lower the graphics in settings."
Pretty fun and engaging for a Gatcha. Only 3 stars though because it is excrutiatingly Data Heavy. I'm talking gigs..and gigs.. and gigs... in dire need of serious optimization.
"I absolutely adore dragalia it took me a long time to get into the game fully but as of now it is one of my favourites to play. The music is outstanding, the story is great and interesting and finally the game is actually challenging and that isn't common for Gatchas"
"Dragalia Lost is my all-time favorite rpg app. It's well put together and super fun, with an array of characters and quests."
Finaly working fine
Greatly improved from what it once was.
"Having returned from a haiatus, I am now unable to link my account as the game will not open a browser to do so. I am now unable to play my account which I spent actual money and a huge time investment on. Play other games which will not flush your progress down the drain."
"Reeally fun game. Easy controls, great time eater. Best part, they give you so much for free and you really don't have to ""pay to play"" at all. Everything you can buy, is something you can earn. Albeit, there's always a grind but that comes with the territory. This game alone stands pretty tall. Wish Nintendo would port this game to a 'Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' format. It'd be amazing!"
"Can't play without update. Update error ""Cant install Dragalia Lost."""
When I installed it it just put on the logos and then a white screen I wait and wait but nothing it just a white screen and I have plenty storage strange
Very enjoyable. The devs appear to listen to feedback and later chapters have improved the story telling.
"Update#2: Emile dragalia gives me life, Emile content gives me strength. Best mobile game please show Emile some love"
So far so good.
"The ai needs major improvements to keep pace with endgame fights. A manual ""gather on me""/split up button would go a long way."
I enjoy this game but getting into end game is very hard where groups won't play with you if you don't have a certain set up. This causes less lobbies for you to play in as you climb higher into harder content. Controller support would be nice.
Its a good game overall but I want my progress back how do I get it? I already have a linked account but how do I load it?
"One of the coolest, most original Gacha games. Easy to start off, and as you get towards endgame content it gets progressively harder. The AI still needs work, but overall a great time to play."
"yessir nintendo, y'all did y'all thing wid this 🥶"























































































"This game has improved a lot since pre-release! I'm having a lot of fun, thank you for this game!!"
I really wanted to thank the team for the free gifts💙 thank you Nintendo! And Cypher💙
It took so long to long
"Unplayable, loads to white screen."
"decent game but progression feels a bit monotonous, a lot of the missions in the main story feel the same other than the story"
At first I thought this was your average gacha but it's different they let you do 50 summons with unlimited retires after tutorial you get a good start this is truly a ftp gacha game it's a must try game
Really fun And arcade stye good
It's really going downhill :(
Pretty good game would recommend
Why no 60fps in menus?
Can't get past the title screen. Phone is a Redmi Note 8
Curse of Nihility is slowly killing this game
This would've been good if I was actually able to tap the screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still can't even get past the 1st menu. I think this was because of an update. I will change this review if it ever gets fixed
It's been fun
best game 10 out of 10 game of the years I get to make a team of gun wielding heroes and adventurers and bust a cap in enemies asses
"I love this game so much! My sister got me into it and I can't stop playing! It's so much fun! I love it! Even though I haven't gotten far, it's quite a good game and very well designed. I love everything about it and the in game events are extremely fun and entertaining! Keep doing good things, Dragalia Lost Team!"
Pretty good so far
This is an excellent game has a great story and the game play so far has been excellent
fun with nice splash art
It's not working on the OnePlus 9 Pro
"I was downloading the required data, then it had a network connection and didn't save any of the downloading process, which took an hour.."
Good gacha game. Easiest re roll you can ever get with 50 free summons. Takes 5 seconds to re roll it. Controls feel smooth and responsive and there is an enormous cast of characters to pick from. I am still early in the game so I can not give an end game review but from what I have seen on you tube and reviews it seems good.
Really good!!
I cant get past the tap to start screen :(
Enjoying the game so far
"Great game, original and great characters."
Yeah
This game is pretty good with all around good mechanics

Great.
👌
Awesome game. Love the update. Love being able to auto battle in Raids now. Was working if we could repeat auto battle in Raids as well soon?
I love Dragalia lost.
I'm having so much fun playing this game
"I love this app so much, I just wish it had a smaller file size so I could play it. I'm sure it's well over 6gb now and it's a lot. I cant even download it onto my phone and its upsetting because it's such a good game"
I love this game as much as I love dragons!!
"Pretty fun game, very cute graphics, a nice gacha system."
"Its a grate game 10/10, love it, one question tho, when is the switch port"
"I've been playing this game since original release day, about 4 months ago, and love it. Only game like this that I played daily for that long. Haven't hit any paywall yet, the devs are awesome and communicate well about bugs and future plans, and give out a healthy amount of celebratory rewards you can use to summon characters and dragons! Update... Still playing!!!! Over 2 years later, that's unprecedented for me :)"
Okada is truly awful
One of the best mobile games out there. There's lots to do and all is very fun.
So far it's a lot of fun
Love it need more dragon forms pls
Really good game (and really generous)
"Okay, first of all, anime, great music, action. I love it, the music is amazing and the graphics at max do NOT disappoint. It's all amazing! I love it!"
"Doesn't work. After the Nintendo splash screen, the screen turns white and that's it."
Like super MarioRuncan you get rewards
"I have an account I am unable to link. I am using a new device Samsung Galaxy tab s7 plus. When I tap to link at loading screen, nothing happens. 2 days later the support team emailed me telling they have an update that will fix it and it worked! Now I can link my account. The people at Nintendo Co. Are above beyond the best than the others."
"Apologies for my last review, I was feeling immature at the time. The game is very good, but I'd like to mention that the auto-dracoshift function doesn't work with the Dragondrive system employed by a few characters."
Account linking issue fixed with latest update. Thank you!
"I got a new phone, tried to link my account and nothing. I touch the part that says link account, the load icon appears, but it never takes me to a login screen. Already uninstalled and reinstalled and every time it's just a new game. A years worth of progress down the drain."
Great music
I can't see my character models
This game is just sooooòooooo fun like I can't even explain this game does not need any upgrades and the graphics is soon muah I am not far ahead in the story but I can tell it is gonna be FANTASTIC
Fun but I put a different account and now. I have to restart for good 👍
It's good and it's got potential I hope this game keeps on getting new content and gets better I will keep playing it.
"Hey dragalia lost team, the link account button is broken right now. Please fix this"
It a great app game
Cannot link to Nintendo switch account
GALA PREASE
I love the play style of this game.
SO YOU GET RID OF ALL MY WEAPONS AND TURN THEM INTO SKINS THAT ARE USELESS ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?
"Why won't the game start when I hit the screen that says ""Tap To Start"". Please fix this. It won't even let me tap the ""Feedback"" or ""Help"" buttons, either."
Excellent game
This is probably the best f2p game out there. I found it a bit repetitive and without a proper guild system with some form of competition
It won't let me link my account.
Fun
Good
"Nintendo's second best app, next to FEH"
I cant link my account anymore after the update need help
"Very generous to their players, in comparison to Fire Emblem Heroes."
Can't log in to Nintendo account on new phone. The button does nothing. Everything I spent supporting the game down the drain.
This is an amazing and beautiful game. I really love it.






















































































































Pls make the screen land scape
"Every literal thing about it is god tier, especially the music choices"
Persona 5 event ended so fast there was no need for me to even try this game.
It's really fun I love it but it takes up way too much space
poggers uwu
Wyrmite cut is a joke.
I am in
Persona 5
Game is pretty fun! Didn't think I would like it lol
its super
"I couldn't even open the game, also it takes 5GB to play."
this is a surfing game
This is a great gacha game

"I Have One Complaint, I Don't Have Big Enough Phone Storage To Play 🤣"
Great game
Useless. Can't even open the game.
Good so far
Pretty awsome
Simple and easy to learn. Good time killer
Good
Awesome game love it
"Great story really easy controls,matter of fact if you want can skip the campaign entirely if you want to for the people who want to get into the action with the option to read the story synopsis it's nice they give you this option. overall really good game"
"Fun game, the crossovers are really interesting"
I love the game but it takes up most of my storage this is the the third game I have because I cant download anything else because this game takes up all the space for it
Love it
"Its got a decent story line, and easy to understand to play."
Good game so far love the different variety of characters.
"Great game, but takes up wayyyyyyyy too much space"
Pretty fun so far the gacha is also pretty fair. I like it.

































Great game
Updated and became unplayable on my phone despite I have played this game for a year
Awesome gameplay love the chibi look but always have a hard time connecting or staying connected to a server
"I love how when your first downloading the game you have a chance to get many rare units, the game is voice acted and many other good things but the only downside is how big the game is but other than that id rate it a 5 star"
Got on to see the persona crossover only to find out my account been wiped even though it was linked with my Nintendo account
I like this app it now has persona 5
I'm about a half hour in. Joined for the p5 event and have already gotten Mona and Arsene with no trouble. Very fun
Great game its really fun to play and the ost is amazing
"Love the art and very fun to play, love the characters!!"
"Best gacha game. User friendly, good gameplay and a decent story."
Loving this game top games on my list at the moment just pure amazing
"Great game so far but im trying to go back and do the chapters in hard mode but when I go back to previous chapters the game bugs out and all the text disappears, and the loading screen glitches out. Please help"
"Day one player. While the game had its ups and downs it's gotten a lot better. Not the same generosity like in the first year, but definitely better than last year."
Pretty neat
"I really like it, it feels like a real game and not something just thrown on here for a cash grab"
Lots of fun but often confusing.
This is the mobile Zelda
It's not a bad game to play on the phone it is fun but takes long loading time's when you log in
3rd time going in to the tutorial because of a gamebreaking error
A pretty fun game!
It's a really nice game! I started playing today and it's really fun so far!
"Literally will not start. Like I tap when it says ""tap to start"" and it won't start"
🔥💯🤜🤛
LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
"This game is very fun. Normally I don't play through games that make you interact, but this is one I find I'll be playing often."
"Great game, might be too late getting into"
When i downloaded the game and opened it it started with a white screen and nothing happens
Rather good enjoyable easily character to get and because it's Nintendo some I know from other games
Amazing

















































































































































Fun
"The game itself is decent and I love the style but I only started it to earn the Achievements but when I cleared chapter one on normal I didnt earn it, i reset my progress and tried again but again didnt receive it. I personally wont continue playing but it is a good game."
I like dragalia lost it is a fun game it has the anime style story and the characters are very detailed but I wonder what part did nintendo play in this game was it like developing or editing
Cool
Good Game!
Is good
Controls are a bit difficult but thats the phones fault. I absolutely love this game!
This game is the best game I have played on my phone
Is it now playable in phillipines??? Pls tell me i have been waiting this game 3 years now
I love this game is so addictive and I like the story and humor of the game.
New event works fine on my phone but keeps restarting my tablet.
"It is a very cute and fun game, with very surprising good graphics."
Fun 🎮
the best potrait rpg game for mobile!
Is there a matinence break because the game won't let me in.There wasn't a thing that said that the game was on a matinence break.
Great grindy game that receives a lot if attention from its developer.
Good 👍
Best mobile game and very generous dev. Great experience

cute gorls..........
"I can no longer play, the entire screen goes black during combat. Graphics deload after switching through menus leaving ugly black squares."
"A fun game play, but is struggling to remain relevant and entertaining."
Love the dragons
"I'm having issues regarding summoning, when i go to summon it gets stuck on the loading screen."
Amazing











































It's really fun and cute.
Utrecht in business for the frizzy mess 0
Pretty good.
I like the game and the characters
Its ok.
Gaming
This game is awesome
"Very good, it's so fun to play"
"I can't think of any better mobile game that care about their players, everything is just so good the music, the story, the alberiant battle now is better than before too, every single aspects are amazing and since the release of legend volk the difficulty is just perfect 2 days for clearing legend volk in legend and i wasn't even tired you just want to keep on going until you beat him excellent work for the legend agito and the music in this fight is just beautiful. Support this company 👍🏻"
"Played for a year and got bored. Story is very stock anime tropes which isn't necessarily bad, but here it's just boring. Feels like devs don't know what to do with the story and just keep drawing it out instead of using new ideas. Gameplay is quite fun and easy to figure out. Never had much issue with draw rates and they have quite a few events. I just got burned out and bored."
Pretty fun but it lags and cutscenes sometimes break. Though that may be due to me using an older phone
It better now
sarisse is on the case
Orsem
"This game is pretty 👌. Offers a pretty unique experience and provides a wide variety of events that all work around the Gacha and co-op aspects of the game. I'm loving everything this game serves me right now, so I hope it keeps going."
"Doesn't work, I've been trying to download it and play it since I used to play it a few years back, but now it doesn't work and just sits on a silent title screen."
Even know what when I post this I haven't installed it yet but I actually might have a good time that's why it's a 3 🌟
Returning player here. Cant login because of blank screen after nintendo and cygames splash screen. Can I get a refund instead?
okdcringe










Pog
It has great plot and character
everything is perfect this is the best game out for any mobile device
When I go to mana circle its an endless loading screen
The controls are bad
This game has it all. From characters to all kinds of dragons and weapon skins too.
It's a real good game
"I change my review, ever since your revamp, everytime during updates there always network error, when I have no issue on all others games, only this. Fix this already, it been like this for year."
One of my favorite mobile games still to this day and I'm excited for the princess connect collab and hopefully other cygames crossovers
Fun. Nice music and graphics
Wont even load. Hard pass on this one guys
I usually don't play RPG's but this is different not just because its Nintendo because its controls are simple enough to understand and its also a good game to pass time fast and the game is just beautiful
Game is cute










Pretty fun
I csnt update it
"Beautiful, fun, both easy to play in long or short sessions."
Cute art and fun game play make a great combo
Fun game different play style but very interesting. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a new summon game.
Great game.


Pretty nice.
Just cool












































"I haven't played much, but I like it."
"I have a Nokia 6.1 up to date with Android 10 but I can't play this game because I ""only"" have 3gb of RAM. Please tell me why ios devices only need 2gb minimum and not android. And also why you think this is at all fair to people who may have sunk money and time into this."
Sweet game
Fun
"Good characters, fun game lopp"
"I can compare this to Fairy Tail, but better"
Really polished and fun dungeon crawler!

Such an amazing game created by people that care about it.
"Been playing since day one and I gotta say, its my favorite mobile game out there. Time has only made this game better and it looks like the developers are really putting time out to keep the game growing. The game is very friendly to free players and it doesn't require you to use a single dollar to get good. 10/10"
Amazing
very nice ok Cute chibi
I love the game very much it's just dont like that most of my weapons I've been collecting are all gone and cant be used separately and I miss 4 star weapons

"Entirely unusable, completely unacceptable."
Awesome game and great dev team.

"Game is fun,many contents to play and many gifts to obtain,control the character a little bit hard"
Nah
"2 Hours In; So Far, So Good"
Please add an option to put this game in landscape mode and the 5 stars will be yours. I don't like games in portrait mode too much.

"My life has multiplied in joy after getting this maintenance notice gacha game. Every time I open the game, I am pleasantly surprised with yet another notification. I look forward to seeing many more loading screens and maintenance notices in the future."
Nice but there's a little white dot in the beginning that's irritating
"""The game makes you feel like a title screen"" - IGN"
Getting a error that my device is not registered to play even though I have installed it twice from the play store.
Okay so I get the notification that it's now out and I go to the store and I see what's trending right now and I get scared because I remember I forgot to put the milk away. So I run to the kitchen I run to the 7/11 and when I see the Install button I press it. While I wait for this event I start doing a 360 jump but as soon as I could hit the ground I heard the music from this game and realized I have to wait for tomorrow. GG
Put characters in Smash!
It's hands down the best game I've played in a while.
@Keemstar
One of the best phone games i have ever played.
Downloaded to find out it is just game title screen. If you love stupidity at its finest you have found it!!
I'm too hyped for it
Says my device is not authorized to play this game
"Unable to play, this game is not released yet"
Nintendo keeps it real
"Such a great title screen, 5/7 just as good as fight club!"



"Gameplay is simple and easy but hard to master clicking that ""close"" button"
Won't load :(
Good game.
10/10 will title screen again.
SHIRONEKO PROJECT MK.2 SO GUD HEHEH
I haven't even got in yet think they're still getting ready I'll give are you a heads up
Nice color scheme
1/1 best title screen
"From what I have seen this game looks gorgeous, but my phone can't seem to handle it. It tells me that my device is able to download it, but it doesn't even go through the intro or anything. My device is android 5.1.1,"
It says my device is not authorized to play this game.
Wow I love Shulk from Xenoblade Can i have more christmas robins tho
So far. It's amazing. It's what every game should strive to be. The title screen is amazing and has such detail. There isn't much to do but that's the beauty of this game. 5/5 stars. Keep releasing stuff like this and it'll surpass even Mario himself. Dragalia Lost for Smash Ultimate!
"""Ok, this is epic"" -Ben Shapiro (God)"
I AM BEST PLAYER
"5.0 out of 5.0!! Truly a revolutionary game! Already starting out with an unexpected day 1 maintenance, this game is surely slated to be the #1 app of all time!"

Its just a black sceen then a error.
If your not playing this your crazy 😁
The reviews are hilarious. I'm in tears
I am happy to see an new nintendo mobile game I just wish you guys would make the games compatable with every device I still love your games as my child hood is still on going I hope i will gain wonderful memories from this companies games
